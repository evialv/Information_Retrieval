SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 This rule is issued under Marketing Agreement No. 130 and Marketing Order No. 958, both as amended (7 CFR part 958),
regulating the handling of onions grown in designated counties in Idaho, and Malheur County, Oregon. The marketing
agreement and order are effective under the Agricultural Marketing Agreement Act of 1937, as amended (7 U.S.C. 601&hyph;674),
hereinafter referred to as the Act. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Department is issuing this rule in conformance with Executive Order 12866. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This interim final rule has been reviewed under Executive Order 12778, Civil Justice Reform. Under the marketing
order now in effect Idaho-Eastern Oregon onions are subject to assessments. Funds to administer the Idaho-Eastern
Oregon onion marketing order are derived from such assessments. It is intended that the assessment rate as issued
herein will be applicable to all assessable onions during the 1994&hyph;95 fiscal period which begins July 1, 1994,
and ends June 30, 1995. This interim final rule will not preempt any State or local laws, regulations, or policies,
unless they present an irreconcilable conflict with this rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Act provides that administrative proceedings must be exhausted before parties may file suit in court. Under section
8c(15)(A) of the Act, any handler subject to an order may file with the Secretary a petition stating that the order,
any provision of the order, or any obligation imposed in connection with the order is not in accordance with law and
requesting a modification of the order or to be exempted therefrom. Such handler is afforded the opportunity for a
hearing on the petition. After the hearing the Secretary would rule on the petition. The Act provides that the district
court of the United States in any district in which the handler is an inhabitant, or has his or her principal place of
business, has jurisdiction in equity to review the Secretary's ruling on the petition, provided a bill in equity is
filed not later than 20 days after the date of the entry of the ruling. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Pursuant to requirements set forth in the Regulatory Flexibility Act (RFA), the Administrator of the Agricultural
Marketing Service (AMS) has considered the economic impact of this rule on small entities.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The purpose of the RFA is to fit regulatory actions to the scale of business subject to such actions in order that small
businesses will not be unduly or disproportionately burdened. Marketing orders issued pursuant to the Act, and the
rules issued thereunder, are unique in that they are brought about through group action of essentially small entities
acting on their own behalf. Thus, both statutes have small entity orientation and compatibility. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
There are approximately 450 producers of Idaho-Eastern Oregon onions under the marketing order and approximately
35 handlers. Small agricultural producers have been defined by the Small Business Administration (13 CFR 121.601)
as those having annual receipts of less than $500,000, and small agricultural service firms are defined as those whose
annual receipts are less than $3,500,000. The majority of Idaho-Eastern Oregon onion producers and handlers may
be classified as small entities. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The budget of expenses for the 1994&hyph;95 fiscal period was prepared by the Idaho-Eastern Oregon Onion Committee,
the agency responsible for local administration of the marketing order, and submitted to the Department for approval.
The members of the Committee are producers and handlers of Idaho-Eastern Oregon onions. They are familiar with the
Committee's needs and with the costs for goods and services in their local area and are thus in a position to formulate
an appropriate budget. The budget was formulated and discussed in a public meeting. Thus, all directly affected persons
have had an opportunity to participate and provide input. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The assessment rate recommended by the Committee was derived by dividing anticipated expenses by expected shipments
of Idaho-Eastern Oregon onions. Because that rate will be applied to actual shipments, it must be established at a
rate that will provide sufficient income to pay the Committee's expenses. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Committee met on March 22, 1994, and unanimously recommended a 1994&hyph;95 budget of $1,020,039, $10,161 less
than the previous year. Increases in expenditures, which include $154 for research and $18,500 for promotion and
advertising, will be offset by decreases of $18,495 for salary expenses and $10,320 for travel and office expenses.
Major expense items include $113,785 for salary expenses, $57,600 for travel and office expenses, $60,154 for research,
$668,500 for promotion and advertising, $60,000 for export, and $50,000 for contingencies. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Committee also unanimously recommended an assessment rate of $0.10 per hundredweight, the same as last season.
This rate, when applied to anticipated shipments of 8,000,000 hundredweight, will yield $800,000 in assessment
income. This, along with $30,000 in interest income and $190,039 from the Committee's authorized reserve, will be
adequate to cover budgeted expenses. Funds in the reserve at the beginning of the 1994&hyph;95 fiscal period, estimated
at $898,928, will be within the maximum permitted by the order of one fiscal period's expenses. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
While this action will impose some additional costs on handlers, the costs are in the form of uniform assessments on
all handlers. Some of the additional costs may be passed on to producers. However, these costs will be offset by the
benefits derived by the operation of the marketing order. Therefore, the Administrator of the AMS has determined
that this action will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
After consideration of all relevant material presented, including the information and recommendation submitted
by the Committee and other available information, it is hereby found that this rule, as hereinafter set forth, will
tend to effectuate the declared policy of the Act. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 553, it is also found and determined upon good cause that it is impracticable, unnecessary, and
contrary to the public interest to give preliminary notice prior to putting this rule into effect, and that good cause
exists for not postponing the effective date of this action until 30 days after publication in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 because: (1) The Committee needs to have sufficient funds to pay its expenses which are incurred on a continuous basis;
(2) the fiscal period begins on July 1, 1994, and the marketing order requires that the rate of assessment for the fiscal
period apply to all assessable onions handled during the fiscal period; (3) handlers are aware of this action which
was unanimously recommended by the Committee at a public meeting and is similar to other budget actions issued in past
years; and (4) this interim final rule provides a 30-day comment period, and all comments timely received will be considered
prior to finalization of this action.

The purpose of the RFA is to fit regulatory actions to the scale of business subject to such actions in order that small
businesses will not be unduly or disproportionately burdened. Marketing orders issued pursuant to the Act, and the
rules issued thereunder, are unique in that they are brought about through group action of essentially small entities
acting on their own behalf. Thus, both statutes have small entity orientation and compatibility. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
There are approximately 950 producers of Oregon and Washington filberts/hazelnuts under this marketing order,
and approximately 21 handlers. Small agricultural producers have been defined by the Small Business Administration
(13 CFR 121.601) as those having annual receipts of less than $500,000, and small agricultural service firms are defined
as those whose annual receipts are less than $5,000,000. The majority of Oregon and Washington filbert/hazelnut
producers and handlers may be classified as small entities. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The budget of expenses for the 1994&hyph;95 marketing year was prepared by the Filbert/Hazelnut Marketing Board,
the agency responsible for local administration of the marketing order, and submitted to the Department for approval.
The members of the Board are producers and handlers of filberts/hazelnuts. They are familiar with the Board's needs
and with the costs of goods and services in their local area and are thus in a position to formulate an appropriate budget.
The budget was formulated and discussed in a public meeting. Thus, all directly affected persons have had an opportunity
to participate and provide input. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The assessment rate recommended by the Committee was derived by dividing anticipated expenses by the expected quantity
of assessable filberts/hazelnuts handled. Because that rate will be applied to the actual quantity of filberts/hazelnuts,
it must be established at a rate that will provide sufficient income to pay the Board's expenses. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In a mail vote conducted the week of March 28, 1994, the Board unanimously recommended a 1993&hyph;94 budget of $507,010,
$97,215 more than the previous year. The major budget item is $250,000 for the Board's promotion program to maintain
and expand markets for filberts/hazelnuts. This is $30,000 more than budgeted last year for promotion. Other increases
include $2,865 for general and administrative expenses, $1,350 for furniture, $1,000 for a crop survey, $20,000
for research, and $42,000 for the emergency reserve fund. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Board also unanimously recommended an assessment rate of $0.007 per pound, the same as last year. This rate, when
applied to anticipated shipments of 56,000,000 pounds, will yield $392,000 in assessment income. This, along with
$28,000 from previously unassessed 1993 crop filberts, $6,000 in interest income, and $81,010 from the Board's authorized
reserve, will be adequate to cover budgeted expenses. Funds in the reserve at the beginning of the 1994&hyph;95 marketing
year, estimated at $453,673, will be within the maximum permitted by the order of one marketing year's expenses. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
While this action will impose some additional costs on handlers, the costs are in the form of uniform assessments on
all handlers. Some of the additional costs may be passed on to producers. However, these costs will be offset by the
benefits derived by the operation of the marketing order. Therefore, the Administrator of the AMS has determined
that this action will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
After consideration of all relevant matter presented, including the information and recommendations submitted
by the Board and other available information, it is hereby found that this rule, as hereinafter set forth, will tend
to effectuate the declared policy of the Act. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 553, it is also found and determined upon good cause that it is impracticable, unnecessary, and
contrary to the public interest to give preliminary notice prior to putting this rule into effect and that good cause
exists for not postponing the effective date of this action until 30 days after publication in the

 because: (1) The Board needs to have sufficient funds to pay its expenses which are incurred on a continuous basis;
(2) the marketing year begins on July 1, 1994, and the marketing order requires that the rate of assessment for the marketing
year apply to all assessable filberts/hazelnuts handled during the marketing year; (3) handlers are aware of this
action which was unanimously recommended by the Board in a mail vote and is similar to other budget actions issued in
past years; and (4) this interim final rule provides a 30-day comment period, and all comments timely received will
be considered prior to finalization of this action.

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 This interim final rule authorizes expenditures for administration and indemnification, establishes an assessment
rate, and authorizes continuation of an indemnification reserve under Marketing Agreement 146 (agreement) for
the 1994&hyph;95 crop year. This rule also increases the administrative assessment rate for the 1993&hyph;94 crop
year. Authorization of this budget enables the Peanut Administrative Committee (Committee) to incur operating
expenses, collect funds to pay those expenses, and settle indemnification claims during the 1994&hyph;95 crop year.
Authorization of the increase in the administrative assessment rate for the 1993&hyph;94 crop year enables the Committee
to collect sufficient funds to pay expenses projected for the remainder of that year. Funds to administer this program
are derived from assessments on handlers who have signed the agreement.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 This rule is issued under Marketing Agreement 146 (7 CFR part 998) regulating the quality of domestically produced
peanuts. This agreement is effective under the Agricultural Marketing Agreement Act of 1937, as amended (7 U.S.C.
601&hyph;674), hereinafter referred to as the Act.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Department is issuing this rule in conformance with Executive Order 12866.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This interim final rule has been reviewed under Executive Order 12887, Civil Justice Reform. Under the agreement
now in effect, peanut handlers signatory to the agreement are subject to assessments. Funds to administer the peanut
agreement program are derived from such assessments, and deductible type insurance for 1994&hyph;95 indemnification
expenses. This rule authorizes expenditures and establishes an assessment rate for the Committee for the crop year
beginning July 1, 1994, and increases the administrative assessment rate for the crop year which began July 1, 1993.
This rule will not preempt any State or local laws, regulations, or policies, unless they present an irreconcilable
conflict with this rule. There are no administrative procedures which must be exhausted prior to any judicial challenge
to the provisions of this rule.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Pursuant to requirements set forth in the Regulatory Flexibility Act (RFA), the Administrator of the Agricultural
Marketing Service (AMS) has considered the economic impact of this rule on small entities.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The purpose of the RFA is to fit regulatory actions to the scale of business subject to such actions in order that small
businesses will not be unduly or disproportionately burdened.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
There are approximately 47,000 producers of peanuts in the 16 States covered under the agreement, and approximately
76 handlers regulated under the agreement. Small agricultural producers have been defined by the Small Business
Administration (13 CFR 121.601) as those having annual receipts of less than $500,000, and small agricultural service
firms are defined as those whose annual receipts are less than $3,500,000. A majority of the producers may be classified
as small entities, and some of the handlers covered under the agreement are small entities.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under the agreement, the assessment rate for a particular crop year applies to all assessable tonnage handled from
the beginning of such year (i.e., July 1). An annual budget of expenses is prepared by the Committee and submitted to
the Department for approval. The members of the Committee are handlers and producers of peanuts. They are familiar
with the Committee's needs and with the costs for goods, services, and personnel for program operations and, thus,
are in a position to formulate appropriate budgets. The budgets are formulated and discussed at industry-wide meetings.
Thus, all directly affected persons have an opportunity to provide input in recommending the budget, assessment
rate, and indemnification reserve. The handlers of peanuts who are directly affected have signed the marketing agreement
authorizing the expenses that may be incurred and the imposition of assessments.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The assessment rate recommended by the Committee for the 1994&hyph;95 crop year was derived by dividing anticipated
expenses by expected receipts and acquisitions of farmers' stock peanuts. It applies to all assessable peanuts received
or acquired by handlers from July 1, 1994. Because that rate is applied to actual receipts and acquisitions, it must
be established at a rate which will produce sufficient income to pay the Committee's expenses.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Committee met on March 16, 1994, and unanimously recommended 1994&hyph;95 crop year administrative expenses
of $1,056,000 and an administrative assessment rate of $0.60 per net ton of assessable farmers' stock peanuts received
or acquired by handlers. In comparison, 1993&hyph;94 crop year budgeted administrative expenditures were $1,020,000,
and the administrative assessment rate was initially recommended and fixed at $0.60 per ton.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Administrative budget items for 1994&hyph;95 which have increased compared to those budgeted for 1993&hyph;94
(in parentheses) are: Executive salaries, $140,146 ($134,304), clerical salaries, $132,500 ($127,479), field
representatives salaries, $290,420 ($278,778), field representatives travel, $110,000 ($107,000), insurance
and bonds, $8,500 ($7,500), and furniture and equipment, $9,500 ($4,000). Items which have decreased compared to
those budgeted for 1993&hyph;94 (in parentheses) are: Payroll taxes, $43,000 ($45,000), office rent and parking,
$50,000 ($52,500), postage and mailing, $12,000 ($13,000), and audit fees, $9,200 ($9,500). All other items are
budgeted at last year's amounts. The administrative budget includes $14,234 for contingencies ($4,439 last year).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Committee also unanimously recommended 1994 crop indemnification claims payments of up to $9,000,000 and an
indemnification assessment of $2.00 per net ton of farmers' stock peanuts received or acquired by handlers to continue
its indemnification program. The 1993&hyph;94 crop year indemnification assessment was $1.00 per net ton. Because
of the high number of claims being processed during the 1993&hyph;94 crop year, the Committee recommended a higher
assessment rate so that sufficient reserve funds will be available. The $9,000,000 of indemnification claims coverage
to be provided on 1994 crop peanuts includes $5,000,000 in excess loss insurance to be purchased by the Committee_the
same as last year.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The cost of the indemnification insurance premium and the costs to carry out indemnification procedures (sampling
and testing of 2&hyph;AB and 3&hyph;AB Subsamples, and crushing supervision, of indemnified peanuts, pursuant
to &sect;998.200 (c), are additional indemnification costs which must be authorized and paid from available indemnification
funds. Such costs are not expected to exceed $2,000,000.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The total assessment rate is $2.60 per ton of assessable peanuts ($0.60 for administrative and $2.00 for indemnification).
Assessments are due on the 15th of the month following the month in which the farmers' stock peanuts are received or
acquired. Application of the recommended rates to the estimated assessable tonnage of 1,760,000 will yield $1,056,000
for program administration and $3,520,000 for indemnification. The indemnification amount, when added to expected
cash carry over from 1993&hyph;94 indemnification operations of $12,609,100, will provide $16,129,100, which
should be adequate for the 1994 fund, and to maintain an adequate reserve.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The 1993&hyph;94 budget was published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 as an interim final rule on June 11, 1993 (58 FR 32600), and finalized on August 13, 1993 (58 FR 43066). The administrative
expenses and assessment rate for the 1993&hyph;94 crop year were based on an estimated assessable tonnage of 1,700,000.
Due to an unexpected short crop, the assessable tonnage is estimated to be only 1,476,377. In order to have sufficient
revenue to cover budgeted expenses of $1,020,000, the Committee unanimously recommended that the 1993&hyph;94
crop year administrative assessment be increased from $0.60 to $0.70 per net ton of assessable farmers' stock peanuts.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
While this action will impose some additional costs on handlers, the costs are in the form of uniform assessments on
all handlers signatory to the agreement. Some of the additional costs may be passed on to producers. However, these
costs will be significantly offset by the benefits derived from the operation of the marketing agreement. Therefore,
the Administrator of the AMS has determined that this action will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial
number of small entities.

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Farmers Home Administration (FmHA) and Rural Development Administration (RDA) are amending the regulations
for the Intermediary Relending Program (IRP) to raise the loan limit. This action is needed to allow intermediaries
that have received and successfully used the maximum amount of IRP loans allowed by the current regulations, and have
need for additional funds, to be eligible to apply for such additional funds. The amendment is intended to raise the
maximum outstanding IRP indebtedness of an intermediary to $4 million, from the current limit of $2 million.

Background 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This regulatory package is an agency initiative to make the IRP more effective at stimulating rural community economic
development. The current regulation prohibits approval of any IRP loan that would result in any one intermediary
having an outstanding IRP indebtedness exceeding $2,000,000. RDA is still not encouraging initial loans of more
that $2,000,000. However, some intermediaries have received and reloaned $2,000,000 and have demand for additional
funding to meet the needs of the communities they serve. The primary reason for this action is to allow subsequent loans
to those successful intermediaries that have reached the current limit. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

Interim Rule 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
It is the policy of this Department that rules relating to public property, loans, grants, benefits or contracts shall
be published for comment notwithstanding the exemption of 5 U.S.C. 553 with respect to such rules. However, FmHA/RDA
is making this action effective upon publication in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 without securing prior public comment. It would be contrary to the public interest to wait for public comments before
implementing an increase in loan ceiling. There is an immediate need to provide funds to the public to help alleviate
severe economic hardship which exists in many rural areas as the result of high unemployment and poverty level wages.
Numerous intermediaries now exist that have received the maximum of $2 million, have successfully used all of the
funds to assist rural businesses, and have urgent need for additional loan funds. These intermediaries have proven
their ability to play a major and successful role in stimulating the economy and developing jobs in rural areas with
high unemployment and depressed economies. Increasing the IRP loan ceiling quickly will allow them to receive additional
IRP funds and continue to provide urgently needed assistance to businesses in their service areas. Delaying action
will deprive them of needed funding. Comments will be accepted for 60 days after publication and, if appropriate,
adjustments will be made in the regulation based on the comments.

SUMMARY:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 We are amending our regulations by removing Portugal from the list of countries where bovine spongiform encephalopathy
exists. Portugal had been added to the list in December 1993 after the disease was diagnosed in cattle in that country.
We are now removing Portugal from the list of countries where bovine spongiform encephalopathy exists because epidemiological
investigations have revealed that the cattle in which the disease was detected had been imported into Portugal from
Great Britain, and that all suspect animals were destroyed. This action will relieve certain prohibitions or restrictions
on the importation of certain fresh, chilled, and frozen meat, and certain other animal products and animal byproducts
derived from ruminants that have been in Portugal.

products, animal byproducts, hay, and straw into the United States in order to prevent the introduction of various
animal diseases, including bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
BSE is a neurological disease of bovine animals and other ruminants. The disease is not known to be contagious. The
major means of spread of BSE appears to be through the use of ruminant feed containing protein and other products from
ruminants infected with BSE. Therefore, BSE could become established in the United States if materials carrying
the BSE agent, such as certain meat, animal products, or animal byproducts derived from ruminants in countries in
which BSE exists, were imported into the United States and fed to ruminants. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Sections 94.18 and 95.4 of the regulations prohibit or restrict the importation of certain meat, animal products,
and animal byproducts derived from ruminants that have been in countries in which BSE exists, and &sect;96.2(b) prohibits
the importation of ruminant casings from countries in which BSE exists. Those countries are listed in &sect;94.18
of the regulations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

In an interim rule published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 on December 13, 1993 (58 FR 65103&hyph;65104, Docket No. 93&hyph;149&hyph;1) and effective on December 7, 1993,
we amended the regulations by adding Portugal to the list of countries where BSE exists after the disease was detected
in cattle in Portugal. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
We solicited comments concerning the interim rule for a 60-day comment period ending February 11, 1994. We received
three comments by that date, all of which opposed the interim rule. The comments were sent by a representative of a U.S.
trade association, a U.S. manufacturer, and a representative of the Commission of the European Communities. Two
of the commenters opposed the interim rule because of its effect on the importation of certain animal products from
Portugal; the third commenter urged us to consider updated information regarding Portugal's epidemiological investigation
of the situation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A report from the Portuguese Ministry of Agriculture to the Office of International Epizootics and the European Economic
Union stated that BSE had been detected in one cow and suspected in three other cows, all of which had been imported into
Portugal from Great Britain, where BSE is known to exist. This report led to our December 1993 interim rule adding Portugal
to the list of countries where BSE is known to exist. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Subsequent epidemiological investigations conducted by Portuguese veterinary officials revealed that the infected
animal, an 8-year-old Holstein-Friesian cow, was born in Great Britain in 1984 and imported into Portugal from Great
Britain in 1987. The affected cow and the three suspect cows were destroyed and the premises placed under quarantine
and official control throughout the epidemiological investigation. There have been no reports of any additional
animals in Portugal being affected with BSE. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In the course of their investigation, Portuguese veterinary officials established that no rendered products of
animal origin were ever imported for animal feed. In February 1990, the Portuguese Government prohibited the importation
of live cattle and all raw materials and byproducts of animal origin from Great Britain, Northern Ireland, and the
Republic of Ireland. Additionally, all livestock in Portugal, both domestic and imported, are subject to official
supervision and veterinary controls established at the national level. These veterinary controls include an official
registry system, animal identification, and monitoring of all animal movement. Diagnostic capabilities for BSE
are available at national veterinary laboratories in Lisbon and Porto. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Therefore, based on the comments received, on the epidemiological information provided by Portuguese veterinary
officials, and on the results of our continuing study of the situation described in the December 1993 interim rule,
we are removing Portugal from the list of countries where BSE is known to exist.

Prompt implementation is needed to relieve unnecessary restrictions on the importation of certain fresh, chilled,
and frozen meat, and certain other animal products and animal byproducts derived from ruminants that have been in
Portugal. With these restrictions lifted, U.S. importers will be able to resume their importation of the animal products
and animal byproducts described above. Portuguese producers and exporters that had been denied these U.S. markets
by our December 1993 interim rule will be able to resume their business with the United States.

For this action, the Office of Management and Budget has waived its review process required by Executive Order 12866.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The provisions of this rule will not have a significant economic impact. The December 1993 interim rule that placed
Portugal on the list of countries in which BSE exists had the effect of restricting the importation of some animal products
and prohibiting the importation of others. Natural sausage casings were the only affected commodity that had been
imported from Portugal in quantities sufficient to cause any economic impact. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This rule will remove the prohibition on the importation of natural sausage casings of ruminant origin from Portugal.
About 20 small U.S. entities had been importing natural sausage casings from Portugal prior to the December 1993 interim
rule. None of the companies had been totally dependent on Portugal for sausage casings, as Portugal supplied only
2.5 percent of natural sausage casings imported into the United States. This rule will have a negligible economic
impact on these small entities. Additionally, price and competition in the United States will not be affected. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under these circumstances, the Administrator of the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service has determined that
this action will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 On November 8, 1993, the Corporation proposed regulations setting forth procedures to be used in requesting access
to and responding to requests for Corporation records. See 58 FR 59210. Essentially, the Corporation proposed regulations
that provided that all requests for access to Corporation records must be in writing, adequately describe the material
sought, and be sent to the Corporation in McLean, Virginia. The proposed regulations delegated to the Freedom of Information
Officer authority to make initial determinations concerning requests for access to records, and provided procedures
for final Corporation decisions on administrative appeals. The proposed regulations also recited the statutory
bases for exemption from disclosure and provided that any reasonably segregable portion of a record shall be produced
as provided by the Freedom of Information Act, 5 U.S.C. 552 (FOIA). The proposed regulations provided a fee structure
consistent with the Uniform Freedom of Information Act Fee Schedule and Guidelines published by the Office of Management
and Budget on March 27, 1987 (52 FR 10012). The proposed regulations also set forth factors to be considered in determining
whether to waive or reduce fees. Consistent with Executive Order 12600 published on June 23, 1987, pertaining to access
to certain information submitted to an agency, the proposed regulations provided that, upon receipt of a request
for possibly confidential commercial or financial information which may be protected from disclosure under FOIA
exemption (b)(4), the Corporation shall notify the submitter and provide an opportunity to comment on possible disclosure.
The Corporation did not receive any comments in response to the proposed regulations. The Corporation now adopts
12 CFR part 1402 as a final regulation without any revision.

Requests for records shall be in writing, in an envelope clearly marked ``FOIA Request,'' and addressed to the Freedom
of Information Officer, Farm Credit System Insurance Corporation, McLean, Virginia 22102&hyph;0826. A request
improperly addressed will be deemed not to have been received for purposes of the 10-day time period set forth in &sect;1402.14(a)
until it is received, or would have been received with the exercise of due diligence by the Freedom of Information Officer.
Records requested in conformance with this subpart and which are not exempt records may be received in person or by
mail as specified in the request. Records to be received in person will be available for inspection or copying during
business hours on a regular business day in the offices of the Farm Credit System Insurance Corporation, McLean, Virginia
22102&hyph;0826.

Response to requests for records. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(a) Within 10 days (excluding Saturdays, Sundays, and legal public holidays), or any extension thereof as provided
in paragraph (d) of this section, of the receipt of a request, the Freedom of Information Officer shall determine whether
to comply with or to deny such request and place a notice thereof in writing in the mail addressed to the requester. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) Within 30 days of the receipt of a notice denying, in whole or in part, a request for records, the requester may appeal
the denial. The appeal shall be in writing addressed to the Chief Financial Officer, Farm Credit System Insurance
Corporation, and both the letter and envelope shall be clearly marked ``FOIA Appeal.'' An appeal improperly addressed
shall be deemed not to have been received for purposes of the 20-day time period set forth in paragraph (c) of this section
until it is received, or would have been received with the exercise of due diligence by Farm Credit System Insurance
Corporation personnel. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) Within 20 days (excluding Saturdays, Sundays, and legal public holidays), or any extension thereof as provided
in paragraph (d) of this section, of the receipt of an appeal, the Farm Credit System Insurance Corporation shall act
upon the appeal and place a notice of the determination thereof in writing in the mail addressed to the requester. If
the determination on the appeal upholds in whole or in part the denial of the request for records, or, if a determination
on the appeal has not been mailed at the end of the 20-day period or the last extension thereof, the requester is deemed
to have exhausted that person's administrative remedies, giving rise to a right of review in a district court of the
United States as specified in 5 U.S.C. 552(a)(4). When a determination cannot be mailed within the applicable time
limit, the appeal will nevertheless be processed. In such case, upon the expiration of the time limit, the requester
will be informed of the reason for the delay, of the date on which a determination may be expected to be mailed, and of
that person's right to seek judicial review. The requester may be asked to forego judicial review until determination
of the appeal. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(d) In unusual circumstances as specified in this paragraph the 10-day time limit prescribed in paragraph (a) of this
section or the 20-day time limit prescribed in paragraph (c) of this section, or both, may be extended provided that
the total of all extensions shall not exceed 10 days (excluding Saturdays, Sundays, and legal public holidays). Extensions
shall be made by written notice to the requester setting forth the reasons for the extension and the date on which a determination
is expected to be mailed. As used in this paragraph,

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 means, but only to the extent necessary to the proper processing of the request: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) The need to search for and collect the requested records from field facilities or other establishments that are
separate from the office processing the request; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) The need to search for, collect, and appropriately examine a voluminous amount of separate and distinct records
which are demanded in a single request; or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) The need for consultation, which shall be conducted with all practicable speed, with another agency having a substantial
interest in the determination of the request or among two or more components of the Farm Credit System Insurance Corporation
having substantial subject-matter interest therein.

Business information. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(a) Business information provided to the Farm Credit System Insurance Corporation by a business submitter shall
not be disclosed pursuant to a Freedom of Information Act request except in accordance with this section. The requirements
of this section shall not apply if: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) The Farm Credit System Insurance Corporation determines that the information should not be disclosed; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) The information lawfully has been published or otherwise made available to the public; or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Disclosure of the information is required by law (other than 5 U.S.C. 552). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) For the purpose of this section, the following definitions shall apply.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Business information
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 means any person or entity which provides business information to the government. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Requester
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 means the person or entity making the Freedom of Information Act request. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c)(1) The Freedom of Information Officer shall, to the extent permitted by law, provide a business submitter with
prompt written notice of a request encompassing its business information whenever required under paragraph (d)
of this section. Such notice shall either describe the exact nature of the business information requested or provide
copies of the records or portions thereof containing the business information. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Whenever the Freedom of Information Officer provides a business submitter with the notice set forth in paragraph
(c)(1) of this section, the Freedom of Information Officer shall notify the requester that the request includes information
that may arguably be exempt from disclosure under 5 U.S.C. 552(b)(4) and that the person or entity who submitted the
information to the Farm Credit System Insurance Corporation has been given the opportunity to comment on the proposed
disclosure of information. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(d)(1) The Farm Credit System Insurance Corporation shall provide a business submitter with notice of a request whenever:

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) The business submitter has in good faith designated the information as commercially or financially sensitive
information; or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) The Farm Credit System Insurance Corporation has reason to believe that the disclosure of the information may
result in commercial or financial injury to the business submitter. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Notice of a request for business information falling within paragraph (d)(1)(i) of this section shall be required
for a period of not more than 10 years after the date of submission unless the business submitter requests and provides
acceptable justification for a specific notice period of greater duration. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Whenever possible, the business submitter's claim of confidentiality should be supported by a statement or certification
by an officer or authorized representative of the business submitter that the information in question is in fact a
trade secret or commercial or financial information that is privileged or confidential. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(e) Through the notice described in paragraph (c) of this section, the Farm Credit System Insurance Corporation shall,
to the extent permitted by law, afford a business submitter a reasonable period within which it can provide the Farm
Credit System Insurance Corporation with a detailed statement of any objection to disclosure. Such statement shall
specify all grounds for withholding any of the information under any exemption of the Freedom of Information Act and,
in the case of the exemption provided by 5 U.S.C. 552(b)(4), shall demonstrate why the information is contended to
be a trade secret or commercial or financial information that is privileged or confidential. Information provided
by a business submitter pursuant to this paragraph may itself be subject to disclosure under the Freedom of Information
Act. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(f)(1) The Farm Credit System Insurance Corporation shall consider carefully a business submitter's objections
and specific grounds for nondisclosure prior to determining whether to disclose business information. Whenever
the Farm Credit System Insurance Corporation decides to disclose business information over the objection of a business
submitter, the Freedom of Information Officer shall forward to the business submitter a written notice which shall
include: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) A statement of the reasons for which the business submitter's disclosure objections were not sustained; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) A description of the business information to be disclosed; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) A specified disclosure date. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) The notice of intent to disclose required by this paragraph shall be sent, to the extent permitted by law, within
a reasonable number of days prior to the specified date upon which disclosure is intended. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) The Freedom of Information Officer shall send a copy of such disclosure notice to the requester at the same time
the notice is sent to the business submitter. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(g) Whenever a requester brings suit seeking to compel disclosure of business information covered by paragraph (d)
of this section, the Farm Credit System Insurance Corporation shall promptly notify the business submitter of such
action.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
For the purpose of this subpart, the following definitions shall apply: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(a) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Commercial use request
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 means a request for information that is from or on behalf of an individual or entity seeking information for a use or
purpose that furthers the commercial, trade, or profit interests of the requester or on whose behalf the request is
being made. To determine whether a request is properly classified as a commercial use request, the Farm Credit System
Insurance Corporation shall determine the purpose for which the documents requested will be used. If the Farm Credit
System Insurance Corporation has reasonable cause to doubt the purpose specified in the request, for which a requester
will use the records sought, or where the purpose is not clear from the request itself, the Farm Credit System Insurance
Corporation shall seek additional clarification before assigning the request to a specified category. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Direct costs
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 means those expenditures the Farm Credit System Insurance Corporation actually incurs in searching for and reproducing
documents to respond to a request for information. In the case of a commercial use request, the term also means those
expenditures the Farm Credit System Insurance Corporation actually incurs in reviewing documents to respond to
the request. The direct cost shall include the salary of the employee performing work (the basic rate of pay for the
employee plus 16 percent of that rate to cover benefits) and the cost of operating reproduction equipment. Not included
in direct costs are overhead expenses such as costs of space, and heating or lighting the facility in which the records
are stored. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Educational institution
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 means a preschool, a public or private elementary or secondary school, an institution of undergraduate higher education,
an institution of graduate higher education, an institution of professional education, and an institution of vocational
education that operates a program or programs of scholarly research. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(d) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Noncommercial scientific institution
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 refers to an institution that is not operated on a commercial, trade, or profit basis and that is operated solely for
the purpose of conducting scientific research, the results of which are not intended to promote any particular product
or industry. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(e) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Representative of the news media
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 means any person actively gathering news for an entity that is organized and operated to publish or broadcast news
to the public. The term 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
news
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 means information that is about current events or that would be of current interest to the public. Examples of news
media entities include television or radio stations broadcasting to the public at large, and publishers of periodicals
(but only in those instances when the periodicals can qualify as disseminators of ``news'') who make their products
available for purchase or subscription by the general public. These examples are not intended to be all-inclusive.
As traditional methods of news delivery evolve (e.g., electronic dissemination of newspapers through telecommunication
services), such alternative media would be included in this category. ``Freelance'' journalists may be regarded
as working for a news organization if they can demonstrate a solid basis for expecting publication through that organization
even though they are not actually employed by the organization. A publication contract would be the clearest proof
that a journalist is working for a news organization, but the Farm Credit System Insurance Corporation may look to
a requester's past publication record to determine whether a journalist is working for a news organization.

 and 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
reproduction
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 mean the process of making a copy of a document necessary to respond to a request for information. Such copies take the
form of paper copy, microfilm, audio-visual materials, or machine readable documentation (e.g., magnetic tape
or disk), among others. The copy provided shall be in a form that is reasonably usable by requesters. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(g) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Review
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 means the process of examining documents located in response to a request for information to determine whether any
portion of any document located is permitted to be withheld. It also includes processing any documents for disclosure
(e.g., doing all that is necessary to prepare the documents for release). The term review does not include the time
spent resolving general legal or policy issues regarding the application of exemptions. The Farm Credit System Insurance
Corporation shall only charge fees for reviewing documents in response to a commercial use request. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(h) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Search
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 includes all time spent looking for material that is responsive to a request for information, including page-by-page
or line-by-line identification of material within documents. Searching for material shall be done in the most efficient
and least expensive manner so as to minimize the costs of the Farm Credit System Insurance Corporation and the requester.
For example, a line-by-line search for responsive material should not be performed when merely reproducing an entire
document would be the less expensive and the faster method of complying with a request for information. Searches may
be done manually or by computer using existing programming. A ``search'' for material that is responsive to a request
should be distinguished from a ``review'' of material to determine whether the material is exempt from disclosure.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(a) The Farm Credit System Insurance Corporation shall charge fees for records requested by or on behalf of educational
institutions and noncommercial scientific institutions in an amount which equals the cost of reproducing the documents
responsive to the request, excluding the costs of reproducing the first 100 pages. For a request to be included in this
category, requesters must show that the request being made is authorized by and under the auspices of a qualifying
institution and that the records are not sought for a commercial use but are sought in furtherance of scholarly research
(if the request is from an educational institution) or scientific research (if the request is from a noncommercial
scientific institution). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) The Farm Credit System Insurance Corporation shall charge fees for records requested by representatives of the
news media in an amount which equals the cost of reproducing the documents responsive to the request, excluding the
costs of reproducing the first 100 pages. For a request to be included in this category, the requester must qualify
as a representative of the news media and the request must not be made for a commercial use. A request for records supporting
the news dissemination function of the requester shall not be considered to be a request that is for a commercial use.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) The Farm Credit System Insurance Corporation shall charge fees for records requested by persons or entities making
a commercial use request in an amount that equals the full direct costs for searching for, reviewing for release, and
reproducing the records sought. Commercial use requesters are not entitled to 2 hours of free search time nor 100 free
pages of reproduction of documents. In accordance with &sect;1402.26, commercial use requesters may be charged
the costs of searching for and reviewing records even if there is ultimately no disclosure of records. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(d) The Farm Credit System Insurance Corporation shall charge fees for records requested by persons or entities that
are not classified in any of the categories listed in paragraphs (a), (b), or (c) of this section in an amount that equals
the full reasonable direct cost of searching for and reproducing records that are responsive to the request, excluding
the first 2 hours of search time and the cost of reproducing the first 100 pages of records. In accordance with &sect;1402.26,
requesters in this category may be charged the cost of searching for records even if there is ultimately no disclosure
of records, excluding the first 2 hours of search time. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(e) For purposes of the exceptions contained in this section on assessment of fees, the word 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
pages
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 refers to paper copies of ``81/2 &times; 11'' or ``11 &times; 14.'' Thus, requesters are not entitled to 100 microfiche
or 100 computer disks, for example. A microfiche containing the equivalent of 100 pages or a computer disk containing
the equivalent of 100 pages of computer printout meets the terms of the exception. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(f) For purposes of paragraph (d) of this section, the term 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
search time 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
has as its basis, manual search. To apply this term to searches made by computer, the Farm Credit System Insurance Corporation
will determine the hourly cost of operating the central processing unit and the operator's hourly salary plus 16 percent
of that rate. When the cost of search (including the operator time and the cost of operating the computer to process
a request) equals the equivalent dollar amount of 2 hours of the salary of the person performing the search, i.e., the
operator, the Farm Credit System Insurance Corporation will begin assessing charges for computer search.

Fees to be charged. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(a) Generally, the fees charged for requests for records shall cover the full allowable direct costs of searching
for, reproducing, and reviewing documents that are responsive to a request for information. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) Manual searches for records will be charged at the salary rate(s) (i.e., basic pay plus 16 percent of that rate)
of the employee(s) making the search. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) Computer searches for records will be charged at the actual direct cost of providing the service. This will include
the cost of operating the central processing unit for that portion of operating time that is directly attributable
to searching for records and the operator/programmer salary apportionable to the search. A charge shall also be made
for any substantial amounts of special supplies or materials used to contain, present, or make available the output
of computers, based upon the prevailing levels of costs to the Farm Credit System Insurance Corporation for the type
and amount of such supplies of materials that are used. Nothing in this paragraph shall be construed to entitle any
person or entity, as a right, to any services in connection with computerized records, other than services to which
such person or entity may be entitled under the provisions of this subpart. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(d) Only requesters who are seeking documents for commercial use may be charged for time spent reviewing records to
determine whether they are exempt from mandatory disclosure. Charges may be assessed only for the initial review;
i.e., the review undertaken the first time the Farm Credit System Insurance Corporation analyzes the applicability
of a specific exemption to a particular record or portion of a record. Records or portions of records withheld in full
under an exemption that is subsequently determined not to apply may be reviewed again to determine the applicability
of other exemptions not previously considered. The costs for such a subsequent review is assessable. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(e) Records will be reproduced at a rate of $.15 per page. For copies prepared by computer, such as tapes or printouts,
the requester shall be charged the actual cost, including operator time, of production of the tape or printout. For
other methods of reproduction, the actual direct costs of producing the document(s) shall be charged. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(f) The Farm Credit System Insurance Corporation will recover the full costs of providing services such as those enumerated
below when it elects to provide them: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Certifying that records are true copies; or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Sending records by special methods such as express mail. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(g) Remittances shall be in the form either of a personal check or bank draft drawn on a bank in the United States, or a
postal money order. Remittances shall be made payable to the order of the Farm Credit System Insurance Corporation.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

(a) The Farm Credit System Insurance Corporation may grant a waiver or reduction of fees if the Farm Credit System Insurance
Corporation determines that the disclosure of the information is in the public interest because it is likely to contribute
significantly to public understanding of the operations or activities of the Government, and the disclosure of the
information is not primarily in the commercial interest of the requester.

(b) The Farm Credit System Insurance Corporation will not charge fees to any requester, including commercial use
requesters, if the cost of collecting a fee would be equal to or greater than the fee itself. The elements to be considered
in determining the ``cost of collecting a fee'' are the administrative costs of receiving and recording a requester's
remittance and processing the fee.

(a) Where it is anticipated that the fees chargeable will amount to more than $25 and the requester has not indicated
in advance a willingness to pay fees as high as are anticipated, the requester shall be promptly notified of the amount
of the anticipated fee or such portion thereof that can be readily estimated. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) If the anticipated fees exceed $250 and if the requester has a history of promptly paying fees charged in connection
with information requests, the Farm Credit System Insurance Corporation may obtain satisfactory assurances that
the requester will fully pay the fees anticipated. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) If the anticipated fees exceed $250 and if the requester has no history of paying fees charged in connection with
information requests, the Farm Credit System Insurance Corporation may require an advance payment of fees in an amount
up to the full amount anticipated. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(d) If the requester has previously failed to pay a fee charged within 30 days of the date of a billing for fees charged
in connection with information requests, the Farm Credit System Insurance Corporation may require the requester
to pay the fees owed, plus interest, or demonstrate that the full amount owed has been paid, and require the requester
to make an advance payment of the full amount of the fees anticipated before processing a new request or a pending request
from that requester. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(e) The notice of the amount of an anticipated fee or a request for an advance deposit shall include an offer to the requester
to confer with identified Farm Credit System Insurance Corporation personnel to attempt to reformulate the request
in a manner which will meet the needs of the requester at a lower cost.

The Farm Credit System Insurance Corporation may begin charging interest on unpaid fees, starting on the 31st day

by the Farm Credit System Insurance Corporation, even if said payment has not been processed. Interest will accrue
at the rate prescribed in section 3717 of title 31, United States Code, and will accrue from the day on which the bill
for such fees was sent.

The Farm Credit System Insurance Corporation may assess charges for time spent searching for records on behalf of
requesters in the categories provided for in &sect;1402.21 (c) and (d), even if there are no records that are responsive
to the request or there is ultimately no disclosure of records. The Farm Credit System Insurance Corporation may assess
charges for time spent reviewing records for requesters in the category provided for in &sect;1402.21(c) even if
the records located are determined to be exempt from disclosure.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A requester may not file multiple requests at the same time, each seeking portions of a document or documents, solely
in order to avoid payment of fees. When the Farm Credit System Insurance Corporation reasonably believes that a requester,
or a group of requesters acting in concert, is attempting to break a request down into a series of requests for the purpose
of evading the assessment of fees, the Farm Credit System Insurance Corporation may aggregate any such requests and
charge accordingly. One element to be considered in determining whether a belief would be reasonable is the time period
over which the requests have occurred.

In the Federal Register of February 16, 1994 (59 FR 7635; corrected February 22, 1994 (59 FR 8507)), FDA amended 21 CFR
74.1340 and 21 CFR 74.2340 to provide for the use of FD&amp;C Red No. 40 and FD&amp;C Red No. 40 Aluminum Lake for coloring
drugs and cosmetics intended for use in the area of the eye.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
FDA gave interested persons until March 18, 1994, to file objections or requests for a hearing. The agency received
no objections or requests for a hearing on the final rule. Therefore, FDA concludes that the final rule published in
the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

Background

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Executive Order 12710 of April 5, 1990, 3 CFR, 1990 Comp., p. 282, terminated the national emergency declared on April
8, 1988, with respect to Panama, and lifted sanctions imposed against the Noriega regime. Pursuant to section 207(a)(2)
of the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, 50 U.S.C. 1706(a)(2), however, the order continued the blocking
of certain Government of Panama assets in the United States, with the understanding of the Government of Panama, to
facilitate resolution of claims of U.S. persons.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
To foster the resolution of U.S. persons' claims against the Government of Panama arising prior to the April 5, 1990
lifting date, the Office of Foreign Assets Control, Department of the Treasury (``FAC''), is amending the Panamanian
Transactions Regulations, 31 CFR part 565 (the ``Regulations'') to include a statement of licensing policy announcing
that the release of blocked Government of Panama assets may be licensed at the request of that government to satisfy
settlements, final judgments and arbitral awards in favor of U.S. persons, where the claims arose prior to April 5,
1990. In addition, FAC will accept license applications from U.S. persons seeking judicial orders of attachment
against blocked Government of Panama assets in satisfaction of final judgments entered in favor of the applicants
with respect to such claims against the Government of Panama, provided such applications are submitted no later that
June 15, 1994. The term ``Government of Panama'' for these purposes is defined in &sect;565.303 of the Regulations,
including appendix A to part 565.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Note:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Procedures for specific license applications are set forth in &sect;565.801 of the Regulations. Unlicensed transfers
of blocked Government of Panama assets, including transfers pursuant to judicial order, are prohibited and are null
and void as provided in &sect;&sect;565.201 and 565.204. Violations of this part are punishable by criminal and civil
penalties as provided in &sect;&sect;565.701 through 565.705.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Because the Regulations involve a foreign affairs function, Executive Order 12866 and the provisions of the Administrative
Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. 553, requiring notice of proposed rulemaking, opportunity for public participation, and
delay in effective date, are inapplicable. Because no notice of proposed rulemaking is required for this rule, the
Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 601&hyph;612, does not apply.

I. Background
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Implementation of the provisions of the CAA, as amended in 1990, will require regulation of many small businesses
so that areas may attain and maintain the National ambient air quality standards and reduce the emission of air toxics.
Small businesses frequently lack the technical expertise and financial resources necessary to evaluate such regulations
and to determine the appropriate mechanisms for compliance. In anticipation of the impact of these requirements
on small businesses, the CAA requires that states adopt a Small Business Stationary Source Technical and Environmental
Compliance Assistance Program (SBAP), and submit this program as a revision to the federally approved SIP. In addition,
the CAA directs EPA to oversee these small business assistance programs and report to Congress on their implementation.
The requirements for establishing an SBAP are set out in section 507 of title V of the CAA. In February 1992, EPA issued

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Guidelines for the Implementation of Section 507 of the 1990 Clean Air Act Amendments
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, in order to delineate the Federal and state roles in meeting the new statutory provisions, and as a tool to provide
further guidance to the states on submitting acceptable SIP revisions.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The state of Kansas has submitted an SIP revision to EPA in order to satisfy the requirements of section 507. In order
to gain full approval, the state submittal must provide for each of the following program elements: (1) The establishment
of an SBAP to provide technical and compliance assistance to small businesses; (2) the establishment of a State Small
Business Ombudsman to represent the interests of small businesses in the regulatory process; and (3) the creation
of a Compliance Advisory Panel (CAP) to determine and report on the overall effectiveness of the SBAP.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
II. Analysis
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
1. Small Business Assistance Program
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 507(a) sets forth six requirements (a seventh requirement, establishment of an Ombudsman office, is discussed
in the next section) that the state must meet to have an approvable SBAP. Specifically, these elements are: (1) Developing,
collecting, and coordinating information exchange on compliance methods and control technologies; (2) providing
assistance to small business stationary sources with pollution prevention and accidental release prevention and
detection; (3) providing assistance for determining applicable requirements under the Act and permit issuance;
(4) determining adequate mechanisms for notifying small business stationary sources of their right under the Act
on a timely basis; (5) determining adequate mechanisms for informing small business stationary sources of their
obligations under the Act, including a program for referring sources to qualified auditors, or for the state to provide
for such audits to determine compliance with this Act; and (6) procedures for considering requests from small business
stationary sources for modifications of work practices, or technological methods of compliance or compliance procedures.
The SBAP services will be provided by a consortium of three state universities: the University of Kansas' Center for
Environmental Education and Training within the Division of Continuing Education; Kansas State University's Industrial
Extension Service, a program of the College of Engineering and the Cooperative Extension Service; and Wichita State
University's Center for Technology Application. The SBAP will provide information and/or compliance and technical
assistance relevant to each of the six elements above. Additional information concerning individual responsibilities
of the consortium members is contained in the technical support document, which is part of the docket for this rulemaking
and which is available from the EPA office listed above. The SBAP has been operational since October 1, 1993. The SBAP
consortium's contract with KDHE will be renewed yearly.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
2. Ombudsman
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 507(a)(3) requires the designation of a state office to serve as the Ombudsman for small business stationary
sources. The Ombudsman position has been designated in the Office of Science and Support of the KDHE. This position
was filled on November 18, 1993. The Ombudsman will have direct access to the Secretary (program manager) of the KDHE,
to the director of the Division of the Environment of the KDHE, the manager of the air pollution control program, and
other state agencies as necessary to perform the functions of its office independently of the air pollution regulatory
and enforcement programs.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
3. Compliance Advisory Panel (CAP)
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 507(e) requires the state to establish a CAP that must include two members selected by the Governor who are
not owners or representatives of owners of small businesses; four members selected by the state legislature who are
owners, or represent owners, of small businesses; and one member selected by the head of the agency in charge of the
Air Pollution Permit Program. The state has met this requirement. All members of the CAP have been appointed in accordance
with the provisions of section 507(e). The CAP held its initial meeting on December 9, 1993.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition to establishing the minimum membership of the CAP, the CAA delineates four responsibilities of the Panel:
(1) To render advisory opinions concerning the effectiveness of the SBAP, difficulties encountered, and the degree
and severity of enforcement actions; (2) to periodically report to EPA concerning the SBAP's adherence to the principles
of the Paperwork Reduction Act, the Equal Access to Justice Act, and the Regulatory Flexibility Act; (3) to review
and assure that information for small business stationary sources is easily understandable; and (4) to develop and
disseminate the reports and advisory opinions made through the SBAP. The state has met these requirements by committing
the CAP to perform these functions.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Legislative authority for the SBAP, CAP, and ombudsman was obtained during the 1993 legislative session and is contained
in the Kansas Air Quality Act, Section 15. All three programs are funded by air emissions fees, authority for which
is contained in section 8 of the Kansas Air Quality Act.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
4. Two Additional Provisions Which the State Submittal Must Address Include Source Eligibility and Fee Reduction
Authority
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 507(c)(1) of the CAA defines the term ``small business stationary source'' as a stationary source that:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 02 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(a) Is owned or operated by a person who employs 100 or fewer individuals, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) Is a small business concern as defined in the Small Business Act; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) Is not a major stationary source; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(d) Does not emit 50 tons per year (tpy) or more of any regulated pollutant; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(e) Emits less than 75 tpy of all regulated pollutants.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 02 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 507(c) allows states, after notice and opportunity for public comment, to extend the definition of eligible
source to include small business stationary sources which do not meet the criteria of subparagraphs (3), (4), or (5)
of section 507(c), but do not emit more than 100 tpy of all regulated pollutants.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The state submittal specifies that upon petition by a source, the Secretary, after notice and opportunity for public
comment, may include as a small business stationary source, any source which does not meet the criteria of subparagraphs
(3), (4), or (5) of section 507(c), but which does not emit more than 100 tpy of all regulated pollutants. This conforms
to the requirements of section 507(c) and is acceptable. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Also, the state submittal provides that the Secretary may exclude from the small business stationary source definition
any category or subcategory of sources that the Administrator of EPA determines to have sufficient technical and
financial capabilities to meet the requirements of the Act without the application of this program, as provided by
section 507 (c)(3)(A) of the Act.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Secretary, in consultation with the Administrator of EPA and the Small Business Administration, and after providing
notice and opportunity for public hearing, may exclude from the small business stationary source definition under
this section, any category or subcategory of sources that the Secretary determines to have sufficient technical
and financial capabilities to meet the requirements of the Act without the application of this subsection.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 507(b) allows states flexibility to reduce permit fees to take into account the financial resources of small
business.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under state statute, the Secretary may reduce any fee required by the Act for any classification of small business
source to take into account the financial resources of such classification.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
Summary
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The state has submitted an SIP revision implementing or committing to implement each of the required SBAP elements
required by section 507 of the CAA. The KDHE has contracted with a consortium of state universities to implement the
small business stationary source technical and environmental compliance assistance program. The Ombudsman position
has been established within the KDHE and the position has been filled. The CAP has been appointed and has met. The state
submittal meets in full the requirements of section 507 of the Act.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
EPA Action
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
EPA is approving the SIP revision submitted by the state of Kansas. The state has submitted an SIP revision implementing
each of the required program elements required by section 507 of the Act.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA is publishing this action without prior proposal because the Agency views this as a noncontroversial amendment
and anticipates no adverse comments. This action will be effective July 11, 1994 unless, by June 13, 1994, notice is
received that adverse or critical comments will be submitted.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If such notice is received, this action will be withdrawn before the effective date by publishing two subsequent documents.
One document will withdraw the final action and another will begin a new rulemaking by announcing a proposal of the
action and establishing a comment period. If no such comments are received, the public is advised that this action
will be effective July 11, 1994.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This action has been classified as a Table 2 Action by the Regional Administrator under the procedures published in
the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 on January 19, 1989 (54 FR 2214&hyph;2225), as revised by an October 4, 1993, memorandum from Michael H. Shapiro, Acting
Assistant Administrator for Office of Air and Radiation. On January 6, 1989, the Office of Management and Budget (OMB)
waived Table 2 and 3 SIP revisions from the requirement of section 3 of Executive Order 12291 for two years. EPA has submitted
a request for a permanent waiver for Table 2 and Table 3 SIP revisions. OMB has agreed to continue the waiver until such
time as it rules on EPA's request. This request continues in effect under Executive Order 12866 which superseded Executive
Order 12291 on September 30, 1993.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 600 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et seq.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, EPA must prepare a regulatory flexibility analysis assessing the impact of any proposed or final rule on small entities
(5 U.S.C. 603 and 604). Alternatively, EPA may certify that the rule will not have a significant impact on a substantial
number of small entities. Small entities include small businesses, small not-for-profit enterprises, and government
entities with jurisdiction over populations of less than 50,000.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
SIP approvals under section 110 and subchapter I, part D of the CAA do not create any new requirements, but simply approve
requirements that the state is already imposing. Therefore, because the Federal SIP approval does not impose any
new requirements, EPA certifies that it does not have a significant impact on any small entities affected. Moreover,
due to the nature of the Federal/state relationship under the CAA, preparation of a regulatory flexibility analysis
would constitute Federal inquiry into the economic reasonableness of state action. The CAA forbids EPA to base its
actions concerning SIPs on such grounds (

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under section 307(b)(1) of the CAA, petitions for judicial review of this action must be filed in the United States
Court of Appeals for the appropriate circuit by July 11, 1994. Filing a petition for reconsideration by the Administrator
of this final rule does not affect the finality of this rule for the purposes of judicial review, nor does it extend the
time within which a petition for judicial review may be filed, and shall not postpone the effectiveness of such rule
or action. This action may not be challenged later in proceedings to enforce its requirements. (See section 307(b)(2).)
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 Nothing in this action should be construed as permitting or allowing or establishing a precedent for any future request
for revision to any SIP. Each request for revision to the SIP shall be considered separately in light of specific technical,
economic, and environmental factors, and in relation to relevant statutory and regulatory requirements.

SUMMARY:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The purpose of this revision to the Missouri State Implementation Plan (SIP) is to include the lead nonattainment
areas into the existing new source review (NSR) program. This revision changes the applicability requirements by
changing the definition of nonattainment area in the state regulations to include lead nonattainment areas, and
to delete the Kansas City area as a nonattainment area in light of its attainment of the ozone standard.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 On February 4, 1994, EPA proposed a rulemaking to approve the three Missouri lead nonattainment areas into the existing
Missouri NSR program. The objective of this final rulemaking is to approve the three Missouri lead nonattainment
areas into the existing NSR program in Missouri. This SIP revision contains the amendments to the SIP defining three
areas in Missouri as nonattainment for lead. This SIP revision is also being accorded limited approval because it
does not meet all of the applicable requirements of the Act.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=5 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 As of April 6, 1994, Missouri submitted NSR provisions intended to address the limited approval, and EPA is currently
reviewing this latest submittal. The limited approval strengthens the existing SIP as representing an improvement
over what is currently in the SIP, and as meeting some of the applicable requirements of the Act. In particular, the
amendment means that Missouri's NSR requirements, which meet all of the provisions of the preamended Act, apply to
new and modified sources of lead in the nonattainment areas.

EPA may grant such a limited approval under section 110(k)(3) of the Act, in light of the general authority delegated

</FOOTNOTE>

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In 1978, when EPA promulgated the lead National Ambient Air Quality Standard, it was not authorized to designate areas
nonattainment, attainment, or unclassifiable for lead. Under the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990, EPA was authorized
to require states to designate areas as nonattainment, attainment, or unclassifiable for lead. On November 6, 1991,
at 56 FR 56694, EPA designated the following areas as nonattainment for lead: the city of Herculaneum in Jefferson
County; and the Dent, Liberty and Arcadia townships in Iron County. No comments were received in response to the proposal.

In this document, EPA takes final action on the rulemaking to provide limited approval of the incorporation of three
Missouri lead nonattainment areas into the existing NSR program in Missouri.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Nothing in this action should be construed as permitting or allowing or establishing a precedent for any future request
for revision to any SIP. Each request for revision to the SIP shall be considered separately in light of specific technical,
economic, and environmental factors and in relation to relevant statutory and regulatory requirements.

 on January 19, 1989 (54 FR 2214&hyph;2225), as revised by an October 4, 1993, memorandum from Michael H. Shapiro, Acting
Assistant Administrator for Office of Air and Radiation. On January 6, 1989, the Office of Management and Budget (OMB)
waived Table 2 and Table 3 SIP revisions from the requirements of section 3 of Executive Order 12291 for two years. EPA
has submitted a request for a permanent waiver for Table 2 and 3 SIP revisions. OMB has agreed to continue the waiver
until such time as it rules on EPA's request. This request continues in effect under Executive Order 12866 which superseded
Executive Order 12291 on September 30, 1993.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, EPA must prepare a regulatory flexibility analysis assessing the impact of any proposed or final rule on small entities
(5 U.S.C. 603 and 604). Alternatively, EPA may certify that the rule will not have a significant impact on a substantial
number of small entities. Small entities include small businesses, small not-for-profit enterprises, and government
entities with jurisdiction over populations of less than 50,000.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
SIP approvals under sections 110 and 301, and subchapter I, part D of the CAA do not create any new requirements, but
simply approve requirements that the state is already imposing. Therefore, because the Federal SIP approval does
not impose any new requirements, EPA certifies that it does not have a significant impact on any small entities affected.
Moreover, due to the nature of the Federal/state relationship under the CAA, preparation of a regulatory flexibility
analysis would constitute Federal inquiry into the economic reasonableness of state action. The CAA forbids EPA
to base its actions concerning SIPs on such grounds (

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 Under section 307(b)(1) of the CAA, petitions for judicial review of this action must be filed in the United States
Court of Appeals for the appropriate circuit by July 11, 1994. Filing a petition for reconsideration by the Administrator
of this final rule does not affect the finality of this rule for the purposes of judicial review, nor does it extend the
time within which a petition for judicial review may be filed, and shall not postpone the effectiveness of such rule
or action. This action may not be challenged later in proceedings to enforce its requirements. (See section 307(b)(2).)

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

4. At 10 a.m. on June 13, 1994, that land not selected by the State under the provisions of the Statehood Act will be opened
to such forms of disposition as may be law be made of National Forest System land, including location and entry under
the United States mining laws. Appropriation of any of the land described in this order under the general mining laws
prior to the date and time of restoration is unauthorized. Any such attempted appropriation, including attempted
adverse possession under 30 U.S.C. 38 (1988), shall vest no rights against the United States. Acts required to establish
a location and to initiate a right to possession are governed by State law where not in conflict with Federal law. The
Bureau of Land Management will not intervene in disputes between rival locators over possessory rights since Congress
has provided for such determinations in local courts.

5. A portion of the area affected by this order is public land, and has been and will remain subject to overlapping Public
Land Order Nos. 396, 587, 2667, or 2791, and the terms and conditions of those Public Land Orders remain otherwise unchanged
by this order.

the provisions of existing withdrawals, other segregations of record, and the requirements of applicable law. Appropriation
of any of the lands described in this order under the general mining laws prior to the date and time of restoration is
unauthorized. Any such attempted appropriation, including attempted adverse possession under 30 U.S.C. 38 (1988),
shall vest no rights against the United States. Acts required to establish a location and to initiate a right of possession
are governed by State law where not in conflict with Federal law. The Bureau of Land Management will not intervene in
disputes between rival locators over possessory rights since Congress has provided for such determinations in local
courts.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 -->
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The NFIP enables property owners to purchase flood insurance which is generally not otherwise available. In return,
communities agree to adopt and administer local floodplain management aimed at protecting lives and new construction
from future flooding. Since the communities on the attached list have recently entered the NFIP, subsidized flood
insurance is now available for property in the community. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In addition, the Director of the Federal Emergency Management Agency has identified the special flood hazard areas
in some of these communities by publishing a Flood Hazard Boundary Map (FHBM) or Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM). The
date of the flood map, if one has been published, is indicated in the fourth column of the table. In the communities listed
where a flood map has been published, section 102 of the Flood Disaster Protection Act of 1973, as amended, 42 U.S.C.
4012(a), requires the purchase of flood insurance as a condition of Federal or federally related financial assistance

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 This rule identifies communities, where the sale of flood insurance has been authorized under the National Flood
Insurance Program (NFIP), that are suspended on the effective dates listed within this rule because of noncompliance
with the floodplain management requirements of the program. If the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) receives
documentation that the community has adopted the required floodplain management measures prior to the effective
suspension date given in this rule, the suspension will be withdrawn by publication in the

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The NFIP enables property owners to purchase flood insurance which is generally not otherwise available. In return,
communities agree to adopt and administer local floodplain management aimed at protecting lives and new construction
from future flooding. Section 1315 of the National Flood Insurance Act of 1968, as amended, 42 U.S.C. 4022, prohibits
flood insurance coverage as authorized under the National Flood Insurance Program, 42 U.S.C. 4001 et seq., unless
an appropriate public body adopts adequate floodplain management measures with effective enforcement measures.
The communities listed in this document no longer meet that statutory requirement for compliance with program regulations,
44 CFR part 59 et seq. Accordingly, the communities will be suspended on the effective date in the third column. As of
that date, flood insurance will no longer be available in the community. However, some of these communities may adopt
and submit the required documentation of legally enforceable floodplain management measures after this rule is
published but prior to the actual suspension date. These communities will not be suspended and will continue their
eligibility for the sale of insurance. A notice withdrawing the suspension of the communities will be published in
the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In addition, the Federal Emergency Management Agency has identified the special flood hazard areas in these communities
by publishing a Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM). The date of the FIRM if one has been published, is indicated in the fourth
column of the table. No direct Federal financial assistance (except assistance pursuant to the Robert T. Stafford
Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act not in connection with a flood) may legally be provided for construction
or acquisition of buildings in the identified special flood hazard area of communities not participating in the NFIP
and identified for more than a year, on the Federal Emergency Management Agency's initial flood insurance map of the
community as having flood-prone areas (section 202(a) of the Flood Disaster Protection Act of 1973, 42 U.S.C. 4106(a),
as amended). This prohibition against certain types of Federal assistance becomes effective for the communities
listed on the date shown in the last column.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Deputy Associate Director finds that notice and public comment under 5 U.S.C. 553(b) are impracticable and unnecessary
because communities listed in this final rule have been adequately notified.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Each community receives a 6-month, 90-day, and 30-day notification addressed to the Chief Executive Officer that
the community will be suspended unless the required floodplain management measures are met prior to the effective
suspension date. Since these notifications have been made, this final rule may take effect within less than 30 days.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Deputy Associate Director has determined that this rule is exempt from the requirements of the Regulatory Flexibility
Act because the National Flood Insurance Act of 1968, as amended, 42 U.S.C. 4022, prohibits flood insurance coverage
unless an appropriate public body adopts adequate floodplain management measures with effective enforcement measures.
The communities listed no longer comply with the statutory requirements, and after the effective date, flood insurance
will no longer be available in the communities unless they take remedial action.

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 This final rule establishes three additional permanent 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
manatee (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=3 -->
Trichechus manatus
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
) sanctuaries and expands an existing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
sanctuary in Kings Bay, Crystal River, Florida. All waterborne 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
activities will be prohibited in these sanctuaries from November 15 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
through March 31 of each year. This final action will prevent the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
taking of manatees by harassment resulting from waterborne activities 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
during the winter months. The total number of sanctuaries in Kings 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Bay is increased from three (10.7 acres) to six (39.0 acres) to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
accommodate the growing number of manatees using the area each 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
winter, and to offset the harassment from increasing public use. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This action is taken under the authority of the Endangered Species 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Act of 1973, as amended, and the Marine Mammal Protection Act of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1972.

Background 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Crystal River is a short tidal river on the west coast of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Florida. Forming the headwaters of Crystal River is Kings Bay, a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
lake-like body of water fed by many freshwater springs. These 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
springs, because of their year-round temperature of over 74
<!-- PJG 0017 degreeslatlong -->
&cir; F, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
provide an essential warm-water wintering area for West Indian 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
manatees (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Trichechus manatus
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
), a federally listed endangered species. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
During cold weather, many of the manatees wintering in Kings Bay 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
congregate in an area known as the main spring or Kings Spring, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
located just south of Banana Island. This location is also a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
favorite site for skin and scuba divers, who come to Kings Bay for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the clear, calm conditions favorable for learning diving techniques, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
coupled with the opportunity to ``swim with the manatees''. Diver use 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of this area is especially heavy during the cold winter months when 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
diving is impractical through most of the northern states, and when 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the opportunity for manatee encounters is greatest. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The concurrent use of the main spring area by divers and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
manatees during cold weather creates a problem for manatees. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Manatees are shy, harmless creatures that are easily driven away from 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
warm springs by human activity (Buckingham 1990).

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A limited number of manatees (about 15) used the springs in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1970's prior to the establishment of the Banana Island Sanctuary. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
They seemed to tolerate and even enjoy some human contact. These 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
``tame'' manatees readily approached divers and allowed themselves to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
be petted and lightly scratched (Hartman 1979, Powell and Rathbun 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1984). By 1980, the number of manatees wintering in the bay had 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
increased to just over 100. This increase was greater than could be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
accounted for by reproduction, so it was apparent that some manatees 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
were immigrating from other areas (Powell and Rathbun 1984). The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
number of manatees that chose to interact with the public increased 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
only slightly. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Concern for the welfare of the manatees in Kings Bay increased, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
culminating in 1980 when the first manatee sanctuaries were 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
established. The authority to establish manatee protection areas, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
either refuges or sanctuaries, is provided by the Endangered Species 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Act of 1973, as amended, and the Marine Mammal Protection Act, and is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
codified at 50 CFR 17, Subpart J. Under Subpart J, the Director may 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
establish, by regulation, manatee protection areas whenever he or she 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
determines there is substantial evidence that there is imminent 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
danger of a taking (including harassment) of one or more manatees, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and that such establishment is necessary to prevent such a taking. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This regulation allows the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service to regulate 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
activities in state waters to protect an endangered species. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In 1983 the Crystal River National Wildlife Refuge was created 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to protect manatees from any potential negative impacts of human 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
activities. The refuge owns Banana Island, Warden Key and Buzzard 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Island in Kings Bay, a house on the eastern shore currently being 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
used as the headquarters, and some other properties in the area. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Manatee use of Kings Bay during winter months now exceeds 240 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
animals (FWS unpublished data). A majority of manatees currently 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
using the spring do not tolerate close human contact and leave the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
warmer spring waters when humans approach too closely. Research 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
conducted during the 1988&hyph;89 winters indicated manatees spend a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
disproportionate amount of their time in sanctuaries, in direct 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
relationship to the number of boats present, regardless of weather 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
conditions (Buckingham 1990). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Efforts have been made to make divers, snorklers, and boaters 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
aware of the manatee harassment problem. Visitors have been 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
instructed through posters, brochures, and by dive shop personnel 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that they should not aggressively pursue manatees or drive them from 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the springs. Most visitors to King's Bay have been very cooperative 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in this regard. While most visitors conscientiously avoid outright 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
harassment, many seek the manatees out, approaching them to observe 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and even pet them. Although a few manatees tolerate and occasionally 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
invite attention, most appear to find these interactions intolerable 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and alter their behavior accordingly. At times, the large number of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
humans concentrated in this relatively confined area forces all the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
manatees to seek less disturbing conditions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The largest manatee aggregations on Florida's west coast are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
found during winter months on the ledges surrounding the refuge's 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
main spring. Manatees often collect there in the evenings and remain 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
throughout the early morning hours. When few divers are present and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
those few are quiet, manatees usually linger around the main boil, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
particularly in colder weather. However, on days when divers arrive 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in force soon after sunrise, those manatees least able to tolerate 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
human crowding begin leaving the spring and move into the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
sanctuaries. As greater numbers of divers arrive, more manatees 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
leave (FWS unpublished data). On days when the temperatures of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
surrounding waters are not excessively cold, this may not be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
critical, although it still alters the manatee's natural behavior. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On days when surrounding water temperatures are below 68
<!-- PJG 0017 degreeslatlong -->
&cir; F it 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
presents a potentially serious problem. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Although some manatees can tolerate limited exposure to waters 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
as cold as 56.3
<!-- PJG 0017 degreeslatlong -->
&cir; F (13.5
<!-- PJG 0017 degreeslatlong -->
&cir; C) (Hartman, 1979) others become lethargic 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and cease feeding at temperatures less than in 68
<!-- PJG 0017 degreeslatlong -->
&cir; F (20
<!-- PJG 0017 degreeslatlong -->
&cir; C) water 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(Campbell and Irvine 1981). Carcasses recovered following major cold 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
events showed atrophy of fat, emaciation, and an absence of food in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the gastrointestinal tract with no sign of disease; characteristics 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
consistent with death from hypothermia. Manatees appear unable to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
increase heat production through metabolic activity sufficient to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
counter losses to the environment. Manatees are tropical warm-water 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
mammals. They feed on low-energy forage and have high thermal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
conductance and exceptionally low metabolic rates (only 15 to 22 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
percent of predicted values based on body size) (Irvine 1983). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Florida is at the northern limit of their winter range. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Subadult manatees appear to be especially susceptible to death 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
from hypothermia. This is probably a combination of their larger 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
surface to volume ratio and their lack of experience in finding 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
thermal refuges. The length of time a manatee can tolerate cold 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
water before its health is compromised depends on its condition_a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
factor which cannot easily be measured on free-ranging manatees. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Experiments on Amazonian manatees (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
T. inunguis
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
) showed that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
underweight, nutritionally stressed, and fasting mammals have a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
drastically lowered capacity for heat production (Scrimshaw et al. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1968, Chandra and Newberne 1977:127&hyph;176). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
During an extreme cold event in 1990, several manatees died in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Brevard County, Florida. These manatees sought thermal refuge at the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
warm-water discharge from an electrical power generating plant on the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Banana River. Although the discharge raised the temperature of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
water approximately 10
<!-- PJG 0017 degreeslatlong -->
&cir; F, under those extreme conditions, it was 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
insufficient to keep them alive. There is probably no thermal refuge 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in Florida warm enough to guarantee the health of all resident 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
manatees during an extremely cold winter.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Crystal River National Wildlife Refuge is probably the best of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the thermal refuges and undoubtedly the only one capable of supplying 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
all the needs for over 200 manatees through the winter. The springs 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
are fed by underwater artesian springs deep under the insulating 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
surface of the earth, holding the temperature constant. Unlike 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
industrial discharges, this natural water source is not subject to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
mechanical breakdowns or power failures. Unlike most artificial 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
refuges, a readily available food source is available close by and in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
abundant supply. Bengtson (1981) observed manatees remaining in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
thermal refuges for up to a week without feeding during cold spells. It appears it was more energy efficient for them
to fast rather than 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
risk feeding in colder waters. In Crystal River, fasting is probably 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
rarely necessary for long periods, and the enormous outflow from the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
springs can moderate the temperature of much of the bay, depending on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
tidal and wind factors. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If left alone, manatees would use the resources of Kings Bay 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
according to their individual needs. However, research has shown 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that the presence of boaters and divers causes manatees to leave the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
spring heads in favor of the sanctuaries regardless of weather 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
conditions. On days when there is low diver turnout, a greater 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proportion of manatees remain in the springs (Buckingham 1990). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Observations of other wintering areas, such as Blue Spring State 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Park, show that, left to their own devices, most manatees will remain 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in warm water throughout the day during cold weather periods. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Activities that cause manatees to leave a natural thermal refuge can, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
therefore, be considered ``harassment'' because those activities 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
interfere with normal ``sheltering'' habits of the animal. Harassment 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of manatees is a violation of both the Endangered Species Act and the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Marine Mammal Protection Act. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Currently, manatees are able to move away from divers by going 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
into three sanctuaries, Banana Island, Sunset Shores, and Magnolia 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Springs, established in 1980. The Banana Island sanctuary is located 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
near the main spring, Kings Spring, and is relatively warm in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
relation to surrounding waters. Sunset Shores sanctuary is still 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
within the southern part of the bay and provides a feeding and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
resting area in fairly warm water. The Magnolia Springs sanctuary is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
located in a canal development adjacent to Kings Bay and contains a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
smaller spring. Since 1980, the number of manatees using Kings Bay 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
has increased from 100 to 246 in 1990. Although it might appear from 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the increasing numbers of manatees that additional protection is not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
needed, this is not the case. As manatee habitat is lost elsewhere 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
on the Florida peninsula, Kings Bay is becoming more important. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Kings Bay is one of the last 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
natural
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 warm-water areas with abundant 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
food resources. Additional sanctuaries are essential to insure 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
adequate undisturbed natural areas in Kings Bay where manatees may 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
meet their needs, including warm water, food, and areas for resting 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and socializing. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The economic importance of Kings Bay and especially the refuge's 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
main spring to Crystal River and Citrus County centers around 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
recreational SCUBA diving, snorkeling and boating. The area is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
internationally known as a desirable location for winter diving. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
presence of manatees creates a special attraction which dive shop 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
owners exploit by advertising their facilities as a place where one 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
can ``swim with the manatees''. The tourism industry created by divers 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
coming to Crystal River is significant and total sales at five dive 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
shops and three motels more than doubled between 1980 and 1986, with 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the ``manatee season'' accounting for 28 to 53 percent of their sales 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for the entire year (Milon in prep). Due in part to national and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
international publicity manatees have received in recent years, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
number of divers visiting Kings Bay has increased to about 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
60,000&hyph;80,000 in the winter of 1990&hyph;91, double the number in 1980 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(FWS unpublished data). This rapid increase in popularity is likely 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to continue, significantly affecting manatees. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Service intends to provide manatees needed winter protection 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
without adversely affecting diving and other waterborne activities so 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
important to Crystal River's economy. Aerial survey data available 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
on manatee distribution within Kings Bay suggest that strategically 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
placed manatee sanctuaries could provide manatees warm-water refugia 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and feeding and resting areas free from harassment without causing a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
major disruption of current recreational patterns (Kochman 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et al.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1985, Buckingham 1990). It is important to note that, although a few 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
local business people feared losses of revenue following the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
implementation of the sanctuary additions, no evidence of any losses 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
have been observed during the 2 years the sanctuaries were in effect 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
under emergency rules. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Therefore, the Service, by this rule, is expanding the sanctuary 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
area in Kings Bay to provide manatees additional undisturbed habitat 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
during the cold weather months. These sanctuaries will exclude all 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
waterborne activities by humans from November 15 through March 31 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
each year. The total sanctuary area, consisting of less than 10 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
percent of the area of Kings Bay, allows the remaining 90 percent of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the bay to remain open to recreational and commercial waterborne 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
activities. The sanctuary areas were carefully selected to provide 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
maximum protection for manatees and minimum impact on divers. Public 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
input into the selection of sanctuary areas was obtained during a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
workshop held in Crystal River on March 21, 1991. The Service 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
believes that, given these added refugia, manatees will not be forced 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to leave the warm water necessary for their survival and will be able 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to feed, rest, and socialize without being harassed. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The sanctuary addition at Magnolia Springs adds 1.5 acres to the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
previous Magnolia Springs Sanctuary. This short, horseshoe-shaped 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
section of canal joins a canal that feeds directly into Kings Bay. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The addition extends the protected area around a significant artesian 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
spring within the original sanctuary, providing additional protection 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for the small but consistent number of manatees, most notably cows 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and calves, that use the area for giving birth, resting, and as a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
warm-water refuge.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The sanctuary on the north and east sides of Buzzard Island contains 18.0 acres of shallow grassbeds along the northwestern
edge and down the length of the east side of Buzzard Island. This area is primarily used by manatees as a feeding area.
It has limited value as a warm-water sanctuary but contains abundant vegetation within a short distance from the warm
waters in the southern part of Kings Bay. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The sanctuary at Tarpon Springs contains 4.6 acres along the northwestern side of Banana Island. This sanctuary contains
a small spring and is used by manatees as a thermal refuge, feeding, and resting area. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The 4.0-acre sanctuary on the north side of Warden Key provides a protected feeding area close to the warm-water sanctuaries
in the south bay.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A public workshop, advertised in the Citrus County Chronicle, was held on March 21, 1991 to allow local citizens and
other interested parties the opportunity to discuss the pros and cons of different sanctuary locations. A number
of the alternatives discussed at the workshop were described in the Service's draft Environmental Assessment supporting
the Finding of No Significant Impact that was approved by the Regional Director on August 23, 1991. The sanctuaries
as they appear in this rule were selected on the basis of known use by manatees, availability of resources, and minimal
impact on recreational use patterns and homeowners. These sanctuaries were implemented for two successive winters,
1991&hyph;2 and 1992&hyph;3, by two separate emergency rules (57 FR 5988 and 58 FR 5643) when completion of the rulemaking
process was delayed. Legal notices were published in the ``Citrus County Chronicle'' prior to the implementation
of the emergency rules, and each emergency rule offered the Environmental Assessment for review by members of the
public. The proposed rule, published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 of May 13, 1993 (58 FR 28381), offered a public hearing, if requested, and announced a public comment period to end July
12, 1993. Following several requests for a public hearing, a notice was published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 of June 28, 1993 (58 FR 34556) to announce a hearing and extension of the comment period. The hearing was held July 15,
1993, at the Coastal Region Library in Crystal River and the comment period was extended until July 30, 1993, to allow
time for written comments to be received following the hearing. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
At the July 15, 1993, hearing, a clear majority of the verbal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
comments and small minority of the written comments consisted of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
statements opposing either Federal regulations on recreational use of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Kings Bay and the Crystal River National Wildlife Refuge in general, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and/or the procedures used to implement the sanctuaries. Few people 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
at the hearing addressed the sanctuary issue directly and there were 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
several misconceptions as to what the rule would include. Many 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
expressed a fear that future regulations would either eliminate or so 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
discourage recreational boating that the local economy would be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
negatively impacted. Many speakers believed the preferences of local 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
citizens and local political representatives should have been given 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
more weight. Others feared that future regulations would include 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
closing of the refuge, including the main spring. Although nearly 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
every speaker expressed affection for, or at least acceptance of, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
manatees in Kings Bay, many believed manatee protection areas should 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
not be implemented in Kings Bay if they interfered with their ``right'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to use public waterways. A few people questioned the soundness of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the decision to increase manatee protection, although most also 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
indicated they were not aware of or had not read the research study 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reports. Many were not aware that a public workshop had been held 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
early in the process and believed the final rule was already in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
effect. Although one person suggested redrawing one corner of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Buzzard Island Sanctuary to avoid funnelling boats into a narrow 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
channel, none of the negative commenters offered any alternative 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
methods to protect manatees from harassment and a few questioned 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
whether there was any need. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Copies of the proposed rule were provided at the hearing to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
clear up some commonly held misconceptions. For example, a petition 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of 230 legible signatures protested against ``the closing down of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Kings Bay for the Manatees for a period of 8 months per year.''
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Because the rule would prohibit boats from only a small percentage of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the bay (the total sanctuary area comprises less than 10 percent of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the bay and leaves all the boating channels and the main spring 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
open), and because the period they would be in effect is only 41/2 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
months each year, it is likely these people had confused the dates of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the seasonal county speed zone regulations with the shorter sanctuary 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
season. Others may have had the same misconception. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Supportive comments were in the minority at the hearing but 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
constituted a large majority of written comments received. Unlike 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the hearing, which mostly represented only Citrus County residents, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
two-thirds of the written comments came from Florida residents 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
outside Citrus County. Five letters were received from people who 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
spoke at the hearing and wished to reiterate or clarify their point 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of view. One comment came from out-of-state. Of all the comments 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
received, 74 individuals and 12 state and national organizations, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
including national and local chapters of the Audubon Society, Sierra 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Club, and the Humane Society, specifically stated they support the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
sanctuaries. Many supporters suggested additional manatee protection 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
was needed. One-third recommended a ban on night diving. Others 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
recommended allowing only passive observation of manatees. Some 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
people favored expanding the sanctuaries system further either by 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
adding a sanctuary south of Warden Key, extending the season to an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
earlier date, or creating corridors between sanctuaries. Emphasis 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
centered on the southern and eastern parts of the bay where manatee 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
aggregations are largest and most consistent. Save the Manatee Club 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and the Citrus County-based Friends of the Manatee proposed a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
time-sharing plan that prohibited public use of the refuge (including 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the main spring) during extended cold periods based on air and/or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
water temperatures. Friends of the Manatee also recommended 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
enlarging the Banana Island Sanctuary, implementing a boat-free, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
swimming and diving area, and a diver-free manatee corridor between 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
sanctuaries. Both organizations also recommended a ban on night 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
diving and allowing only passive observation of manatees. There were 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
two recommendations for a permit system similar to that used in other 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
refuges to limit the number of divers using the refuge's main spring. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Many people on both sides of the sanctuary issue, expressed the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
need for additional law enforcement effort to monitor not only the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
sanctuaries, but the speed zones, and to prevent manatee harassment 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
by divers and snorklers. There was also a clear consensus that an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
intensive public education campaign would play a key role in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
preventing intentional and unintentional harassment of manatees. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Crystal River Chamber of Commerce appealed to the audience that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
regardless of the outcome of the sanctuary issue, government, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
conservation groups, and citizens should work together to educate and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
inform the tens of thousands of visitors who visit the area each year 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of how to interact with manatees in a safe and appropriate manner.

Although, there were a number of general comments opposing Federal regulation of recreational use of Kings Bay and
the Crystal River National Wildlife Refuge and procedures used to implement the sanctuaries, very few people expressed
specific concerns about the sanctuaries. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
After considering all the comments received, the Service concludes that the additional sanctuaries are needed to
accommodate the increase in the number of manatees using the area each winter, and to offset harassment from increasing
public use and that no changes to the proposed rule are necessary or warranted. Additional sanctuaries are essential
to insure adequate undisturbed natural areas in Kings Bay where manatees meet their needs, including warm water,
food and areas for resting and socializing. The sanctuaries were carefully selected to provide maximum benefits
for manatees and minimum impact on human recreational activities in Kings Bay. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Crystal River National Wildlife Refuge in its 1993 Public Use Management Plan addressed many of the concerns of
those recommending additional manatee protection around the main spring by (1) expanding the Banana Island sanctuary
to coincide with the refuge boundary while establishing a ``swim only'' access corridor to the spring itself from
November 15 to March 31, (2) prohibiting accessing to the spring during night hours from 7 p.m. to 7 a.m. during the winter,
and (3) coordinating commercial establishments catering to refuge visitors through a special use permit system
to ensure the consistency of visitor educational and resource interpretation.

This rulemaking was not subject to Office of Management and Budget review under Executive Order 12866. These changes
will not have a significant economic effect on a substantial number of small entities under the Regulatory Flexibility
Act (5 U.S.C. 601 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et seq.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
). Based on the information discussed in this final rulemaking, it is not expected that significant economic impacts
would result. Also, no direct costs, enforcement costs, information collection, or recordkeeping requirements
are imposed on small entities by this final rulemaking. Further, the final rule contains no recordkeeping requirements
as defined by the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1990.

SUMMARY:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 NMFS announces an adjustment of the beginning date of the annual closure of the shrimp fishery in the exclusive economic
zone (EEZ) off Texas. The closure is normally from 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
May 15 to July 15 each year. This year the closure will begin on May 13, 1994, because biological data indicate that brown
shrimp will be leaving the Texas estuaries earlier than normal. The Texas closure is intended to prohibit the harvest
of brown shrimp during their major period of emigration from Texas estuaries to the Gulf of Mexico so the shrimp may
reach a larger, more valuable size and to prevent the waste of brown shrimp that would be discarded in fishing operations
because of their small size.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Gulf of Mexico shrimp fishery is managed under the Fishery Management Plan for the Shrimp Fishery of the Gulf of
Mexico (FMP). The FMP was prepared by the Gulf of Mexico Fishery Management Council and is implemented by regulations
at 50 CFR part 658 under the authority of the Magnuson Fishery Conservation and Management Act (16 U.S.C. 1801 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=3 -->
et seq.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
). The FMP implementing regulations at 50 CFR 658.25 describe the Texas closure and provide for adjustments to the
beginning and ending dates by the Director, Southeast Region, NMFS, under specified criteria. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Available information meeting the criteria specified at 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
50 CFR 658.25(b)(1) indicates that a closure date earlier than May 15 is warranted and desirable. Biological data
collected by the Texas Parks and Wildlife Department indicate that beginning the closure on May 13, 1994, is necessary
to provide adequate protection of small brown shrimp emigrating from the Texas estuaries. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Accordingly, the time and date at 50 CFR 658.25(a) for beginning the Texas closure is changed from 30 minutes after
sunset, May 15, 1994, to 30 minutes after sunset on May 13, 1994. During the closure, the area described at 50 CFR 658.25(a)
is closed to all trawl fishing, except that a vessel may fish for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
royal red shrimp beyond the 100-fathom (183-m) depth contour. The waters of Texas are also closed commencing 30 minutes
after sunset on May 13, 1994. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The termination date of the Texas closure will be adjusted in accordance with the criteria specified at 50 CFR 658.25(b)

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and to conform to the termination date of the closure in the waters of Texas. The adjusted termination date will be published
in the

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Secretary provides final regulations to implement the National Early Intervention Scholarship and Partnership
(NEISP) Program, a new program authorized under the amended HEA, (Pub. L. 102&hyph;325). The Secretary also amends
a reference to the NEISP Program in 34 CFR 75.60 of the regulations for the Direct Grant Programs. The Secretary also
is making technical amendments in separate final regulations to insert references to the NEISP Program into the appropriate
sections of 34 CFR part 668, the Student Assistance General Provisions regulations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The NEISP Program provides States with Federal financial incentives to establish or maintain a program with matching
State-originated funds. It provides for (1) a scholarship component that, to the extent possible, guarantees the
financial assistance necessary for eligible low-income students who graduate from high school to attend an institution
of higher 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
education, and (2) an early intervention component that uses Statewide resources, both government and private,
to provide additional counseling, financial aid counseling, mentoring, academic support, outreach, and supportive
services to preschool, elementary, middle, and secondary school students who are at risk of dropping out of school.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The NEISP Program's early intervention component supports National Education Goals 2 (High School Completion),
3 (Student Achievement and Citizenship), and 4 (Science and Mathematics). The NEISP Program's scholarship component
also supports National Education Goal 5 (Adult Literacy and Lifelong Learning). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On March 8, 1994, the Secretary published a notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM) for this program in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (59 FR 10926&hyph;10937). The major issues addressed by the proposed regulations are discussed in the preamble to
the NPRM. Except for minor editorial and technical revisions, there are no differences between the NPRM and these
final regulations. One of the technical revisions is that the Secretary is including in &sect;693.40(d) the requirement
under section 404D(d)(2) of the HEA that, to be eligible for a NEISP Program scholarship, a student must have received
a high school diploma or a certificate of high school equivalence on or after January 1, 1993.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In response to the Secretary's invitation in the NPRM, six parties submitted comments on the proposed regulations.
An analysis of the comments and of the changes in the regulations since publication of the NPRM follows. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Substantive issues are discussed under the section of the regulations to which they pertain. Technical and other
minor changes_and suggested changes the Secretary is not legally authorized to make under the applicable statutory
authority_are not addressed.

Comment:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 One commenter recommended &sect;693.10(b)(1) be modified to have the State agency that administers the State Student
Incentive Grant (SSIG) Program be the only designated agency for administering the NEISP Program. The commenter
believed that, since the SSIG agency was already involved with the administration of grant and loan programs as well
as early intervention programs, the agency would be able to ensure that the Statewide efforts would be well-coordinated.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Discussion:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 While the circumstances described by the commenter may be true in some States, the States vary with respect to how they
distribute various responsibilities among State agencies. The Secretary, therefore, continues to believe that
requiring the Governor of a State to designate the agency responsible for the NEISP Program provides necessary flexibility
for the States. In addition, it ensures that program funds are allocated to an appropriate and responsible State agency
and is consistent with other Federal and State-administered student financial aid programs, such as the SSIG Program.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Comment:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 One commenter believed that a State would have to identify private funds expended within the State under &sect;693.10(b)(5)(i)
and &sect;693.13(a)(4) to ensure that the funds provided under the NEISP Program will supplement and not supplant
funds expended for State and local early intervention programs and State need- and non-need-based student financial
grant assistance programs. The commenter believed that it would be sufficient to document the amount of State funds
expended on need-based student financial aid alone or the amount expended for State-matching funds for the NEISP
Program. One commenter was also concerned that, in the Supplementary Information section of the preamble to the NPRM
(59 FR 10927), the discussion of this requirement can be interpreted to mean that a State's matching expenditures
under the NEISP Program should be an amount that exceeds, as opposed to being an amount that is in addition to, the amount
of funds the State previously expended. Another commenter questioned whether State funds appropriated to postsecondary
institutions and used for student assistance in the State could be used as matching funds under &sect;693.10(b)(5).

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Discussion:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Secretary notes that the texts of &sect;693.10(b)(5)(i) and &sect;693.13(a)(4) refer only to ``State and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
local,'' 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
i.e., 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
public, expenditures as does the applicable statutory provision (section 404B(b)(3) of the HEA). Under &sect;693.10(b)(5)(i)
and &sect;693.13(a)(4), a State's matching funds under the NEISP Program represent expenditures that are in addition
to the level of funds previously expended instead of a matching amount that exceeds the previous level of expenditures,
and these funds may include State funds appropriated to postsecondary educational institutions and used for student
grant aid including tuition waivers at public institutions.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Comment:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Two commenters requested clarification concerning whether under &sect;693.11(a) the States were required to provide

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Comment:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 One commenter recommended modifying &sect;693.12(c) (1) and (2) to include an option for a State to award scholarships
based on the State's definition and prioritization of low-income students as an alternative to the expected family
contribution (EFC) as calculated under part F of title IV of the HEA. Another commenter recommended the Secretary
adopt as a standard for defining low-income students the standard used for the Federal TRIO programs.

 The Secretary agrees with the commenter that there are additional standards for identifying low-income students
and agrees that a State should be able to use the State's criteria for identifying low-income students in prioritizing
eligible students as an alternative to using the EFC. However, the Secretary believes that using the EFC represents
a proven methodology for identifying low-income students and that it is in the Federal interest for any departures
from using the EFC to be subject to approval by the Secretary.

 One commenter believed that the extensive data requested under &sect;693.20(e)(2) should be collected for the targeted
area in which the State plans to operate its program rather than providing data covering the entire State.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Secretary believes that, in order to be able to target the areas in which the NEISP Program will be most beneficial,
it is necessary for States to collect and analyze Statewide data as required under &sect;693.20(e)(2). The Secretary
notes that this requirement is not intended to be overly prescriptive and that a State is expected to have sufficient
information available to make a reasonable determination of Statewide needs for early intervention activities.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 One commenter believed that the ``tie-breaker'' to be used in the selection of similarly rated applications under
&sect;693.22(c)(4) should not give preference to Statewide programs. Due to the limited Federal funding, the commenter
proposed that priority be given to programs that will serve a targeted population well, rather than serving students
Statewide but in a less effective way.

 The Secretary believes that the emphasis placed on selecting applicants with Statewide, coordinated programs is
appropriate. Since this provision is a ``tie-breaker'' for otherwise similarly rated applications, the Secretary
does not believe that the State providing services to more areas will be less effective.

 One commenter believed that early intervention programs should be provided as early in a student's schooling as necessary
to be effective and, therefore, believed that there should be a stronger preference for long-term early intervention
programs in the selection criteria.

 During the development of the NPRM, the Secretary gave careful consideration to the need to emphasize long-term mentoring

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
If a State, as part of its early intervention program under &sect;693.11, requires a student to sign an agreement 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that includes academic milestones, the Secretary agrees that the State should be able to require that a student meet
these milestones as one of the student eligibility requirements for a scholarship. However, if a student has participated
in the early intervention program, the student should be eligible for scholarship consideration since income level
is not necessarily the basis for determining scholarship eligibility in the NEISP Program under section 404D(d)
of the HEA.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->

The Secretary is amending &sect;693.40 to provide that if a State includes academic milestones in a written agreement

requirement.

Comment: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
One commenter believed that under proposed &sect;693.40(e) (1) and (2) the Secretary should not limit scholarship
eligibility to those students who participated in the NEISP Program or a Federal Upward Bound Program. The commenter
believed that accepting early intervention programs comparable to those described in section 404C of the program
statute as meeting the requirement would allow States the flexibility to identify additional students as eligible
to receive scholarships.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Discussion: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Secretary agrees with the commenter and further notes that section 404D(d)(4) of the HEA clearly provides for
such an option since it does not require that the early intervention program establishing student eligibility for
a scholarship be funded under the NEISP Program as is required in the case of the Federal Upward Bound Program in section
404D(e)(2) of the HEA.

One commenter believed that, due to the comprehensive nature of the biennial evaluation report under &sect;693.50(b),
it would not be reasonable to estimate one hour to complete the report. In the commenter's opinion, the report could
not be designed and implemented in less than two staff months.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
The Office of Personnel Management (OPM) is proposing to issue regulations to implement the Program Fraud Civil Remedies
Act (PFCRA) which Congress enacted on October 21, 1986. The PFCRA provides a statutory right for the Federal Government
to take administrative action against fraud. The PFCRA also outlines the procedures that must be followed in administrative
actions brought in accordance with the act. These regulations will implement these procedural requirements.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
Public Law 99&hyph;509 provides a means by which Federal agencies may institute administrative proceedings against
persons who have presented false claims or statements and provides further that Federal agencies who institute such
administrative proceedings may recover double damages as well as penalties of up to $5,000 per violation.

The Program Fraud Civil Remedies Act requires agencies to issue regulations. This rule establishes the procedures

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(f) If, on such motion, the defendant can demonstrate extraordinary circumstances excusing the failure to file a
timely answer, the ALJ shall withdraw the initial decision in paragraph (c) of this section, if such a decision has

Sanctions.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(a) The ALJ may sanction a person including any party or representative for the following reasons:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Failure to comply with an order, rule, or procedure governing the proceeding;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Failure to prosecute or defend an action; or
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Engaging in other misconduct that interferes with the speedy, orderly, or fair conduct of the proceeding.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) Any such sanction, including but not limited to those listed in paragraphs (c), (d), and (e) of this section, shall
reasonably relate to the severity and nature of the failure or misconduct.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) When a party fails to comply with an order, including an order for taking a deposition, the production of evidence
within the party's control, or a request for admission, the ALJ may:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Draw an inference in favor of the requesting party with regard to the information sought;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) In the case of requests for admission, deem each matter of which an admission is requested to be admitted;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Prohibit the party failing to comply with such order from introducing evidence concerning, or otherwise relying
upon, testimony relating to the information sought; and
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) Strike any part of the pleadings or other submissions of the party failing to comply with such request.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(d) If a party fails to prosecute or defend an action under this part commenced by service of a notice of hearing, the
ALJ may dismiss the action or may issue an initial decision imposing penalties and assessments.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(e) The ALJ may refuse to consider any motion, request, response, brief or other document which is not filed in a timely
fashion.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(a) Where requested in accordance with &sect;185.109 the ALJ shall conduct a hearing on the record in order to determine
whether the defendant is liable for a civil penalty or assessment under &sect;185.103 and, if so, the appropriate
amount of any such civil penalty or assessment considering any aggravating or mitigating factors.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) The authority shall prove defendant's liability and any aggravating factors by a preponderance of the evidence.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) The defendant shall prove any affirmative defenses and any mitigating factors by a preponderance of the evidence.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(d) The hearing shall be open to the public unless otherwise closed by the ALJ for good cause shown.

Determining the amount of penalties and assessments.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(a) In determining an appropriate amount of civil penalties and assessments, the ALJ and the authority head, upon
appeal, should evaluate any circumstances that mitigate or aggravate the violation and should articulate in their
opinions the reasons that support the penalties and assessments they impose. Because of the intangible costs of fraud,
the expense of investigating such conduct, and the need to deter others who might be similarly tempted, double damages
and a significant civil penalty ordinarily should be imposed.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) Although not exhaustive, the following factors are among those that may influence the ALJ and the authority head
in determining the amount of penalties and assessments to impose with respect to the misconduct (i.e., the false,
fictitious, or fraudulent claims or statements) charged in the complaint:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) The number of false, fictitious or fraudulent claims or statements;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) The time period over which such claims or statements were made;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) The degree of the defendant's culpability with respect to the misconduct;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) The amount of money or the value of the property, services, or benefit falsely claimed;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5) The value of the Government's actual loss as a result of the misconduct, including foreseeable consequential
damages and the costs of investigation;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(6) The relationship of the amount imposed as civil penalties to the amount of the Government's loss;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(7) The potential or actual impact of the misconduct upon public confidence in the management of Government programs
and operations;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(8) Whether the defendant has engaged in a pattern of the same or similar misconduct;

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(9) Whether the defendant attempted to conceal the misconduct;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(10) The degree to which the defendant has involved others in the misconduct or in concealing it;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(11) Where the misconduct of employees or agents is imputed to the defendant, the extent to which the defendant's practices
fostered or attempted to preclude such misconduct;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(12) Whether the defendant cooperated in or obstructed an investigation of the misconduct;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(13) Whether the defendant assisted in identifying and prosecuting other wrongdoers;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(14) The complexity of the program or transaction, and the degree of the defendant's sophistication with respect
to it, including the extent of the defendant's prior participation in the program or in similar transactions;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(15) Whether the defendant has been found, in any criminal, civil, or administrative proceeding to have engaged in
similar misconduct or to have dealt dishonestly with the Government of the United States or of a State, directly or
indirectly;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(16) The need to deter the defendant and others from engaging in the same or similar misconduct; and
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(17) The potential impact of the misconduct on the rights of others.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(a) Except as provided in paragraph (b) of this section, testimony at the hearing shall be given orally by witnesses
under oath or affirmation.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) At the discretion of the ALJ, testimony may be admitted in the form of a written statement or deposition. Any such
written statement must be provided to all other parties along with the last known address of such witness, in a manner
which allows sufficient time for other parties to subpoena such witness for cross-examination at the hearing. Prior
written statements of witnesses proposed to testify at the hearing and deposition transcripts shall be exchanged
as provided in &sect;185.123(a).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) The ALJ shall exercise reasonable control over the mode and order of interrogating witnesses and presenting evidence
so as to_
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Make the interrogation and presentation effective for the ascertainment of the truth,
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Avoid needless consumption of time, and
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Protect witnesses from harassment or undue embarrassment.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(d) The ALJ shall permit the parties to conduct such cross-examination as may be required for a full and true disclosure
of the facts.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(e) At the discretion of the ALJ, a witness may be cross-examined on matters relevant to the proceedings without regard
to the scope of his or her direct examination. To the extent permitted by the ALJ, cross-examination on matters outside
the scope of direct examination shall be conducted in the manner of direct examination and may proceed by leading questions
only if the witness is a hostile witness, an adverse party, or a witness identified with an adverse party.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(f) Upon motion of any party, the ALJ shall order witnesses excluded so that they cannot hear the testimony of other
witnesses. This rule does not authorize exclusion of the following:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) A party who is an individual;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) In the case of a party that is not an individual, an officer or employee of the party designated by the party's representative;
or
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) An individual whose presence is shown by a party to be essential to the presentation of its case, including an individual
employed by the Government engaged in assisting the representative for the Government.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) The findings of fact shall include a finding on each of the following issues:

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) If the person is liable for penalties or assessments, the appropriate amount of any such penalties or assessments
considering any mitigating or aggravating factors that he or she finds in the case, such as those described in &sect;185.133.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) The ALJ shall promptly serve the initial decision on all parties within 90 days after the time for submission of
post-hearing briefs and reply briefs (if permitted) has expired. The ALJ shall at the same time serve all parties with
a statement describing the right of any defendant determined to be liable for a civil penalty or assessment to file
a motion for reconsideration with the ALJ or a notice of appeal with the authority head. If the ALJ fails to meet the deadline
contained in this paragraph, he or she shall notify the parties of the reason for the delay and shall set a new deadline.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(d) Unless the initial decision of the ALJ is timely appealed to the authority head, or a motion for reconsideration
of the initial decision is timely filed, the initial decision shall constitute the final decision of the authority

(e) The ALJ may dispose of a motion for reconsideration by denying it or by issuing a revised initial decision.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(f) If the ALJ denies a motion for reconsideration, the initial decision shall constitute the final decision of the
authority head and shall be final and binding on all parties 30 days after the ALJ denies the motion, unless the initial
decision is timely appealed to the authority head in accordance with &sect;185.139.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(g) If the ALJ issues a revised initial decision, that decision shall constitute the final decision of the authority
head and shall be final and binding on the parties 30 days after it is issued, unless it is timely appealed to the authority

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(a) Any defendant who has filed a timely answer and who is determined in an initial decision to be liable for a civil penalty
or assessment may appeal such decision to the authority head by filing a notice of appeal with the authority head in
accordance with this section:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) A notice of appeal may be filed at any time within 30 days after the ALJ issues an initial decision. However, if another
party files a motion for reconsideration under &sect;185.138, consideration of the appeal shall be stayed automatically
pending resolution of the motion for reconsideration.

the motion or issues a revised initial decision, whichever applies.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) If no motion for reconsideration is timely filed, a notice of appeal must be filed within 30 days after the ALJ issues
the initial decision.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) The authority head may extend the initial 30 day period for an additional 30 days if the defendant files with the
authority head a request for an extension within the initial 30 day period and shows good cause.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) If the defendant files a timely notice of appeal with the authority head and the time for filing motions for reconsideration
under &sect;185.138 has expired, the ALJ shall forward the record of the proceeding to the authority head.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) A notice of appeal shall be accompanied by a written brief specifying exceptions to the initial decision and reasons
supporting the exceptions.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(d) The representative for OPM may file a brief in opposition to exceptions within 30 days of receiving the notice of
appeal and accompanying brief.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(g) In reviewing the initial decision, the authority head shall not consider any objection that was not raised before
the ALJ unless the objecting party can demonstrate extraordinary circumstances causing the failure to raise the
objection. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(h) If any party demonstrates to the satisfaction of the authority head that additional evidence not presented at
such hearing is material and that there were reasonable grounds for the failure to present such evidence at such hearing,
the authority head shall remand the matter to the ALJ for consideration of such additional evidence. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) The authority head may affirm, reduce, reverse, compromise, remand or settle any penalty or assessment determined
by the ALJ in any initial decision.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(j) The authority head shall promptly serve each party to the appeal with a copy of the decision of the authority head
and a statement describing the right of any person determined to be liable for a penalty or assessment to seek judicial
review. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(k) Unless a petition for review is filled as provided in 31 U.S.C. 3805 after a defendant has exhausted all administrative
remedies under this part and within 60 days after the date on which the authority head serves the defendant with a copy
of the authority head's decision, a determination that a defendant is liable under &sect;185.103 is final and not
subject to judicial review.

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 This document proposes the supersedure of an existing airworthiness 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
directive (AD), applicable to certain British Aerospace Model BAe 146&hyph;100A, &hyph;200A, and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&hyph;300A series airplanes, that currently requires replacing the quick release coupling halves 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
on each end of the pump case drain line on the hydraulic engine driven pump (EDP) on the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
number 2 and number 3 engines with improved fire resistant coupling halves. This action 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
would revise the applicability of the existing AD. This proposal is prompted by the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
identification of additional airplanes that are subject to the addressed unsafe condition. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The actions specified by the proposed AD are intended to prevent hydraulic fluid leakage 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
from the pump case drain line quick release coupling, which could fuel the flames in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
event of an engine fire.

Discussion 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
On November 29, 1993, the FAA issued AD 93&hyph;24&hyph;05, Amendment 39&hyph;8754 (58 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FR 67310), applicable to certain British Aerospace Model BAe 146&hyph;100A, &hyph;200A, and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&hyph;300A series airplanes, to require replacement of the quick release coupling halves on each 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
end of the pump case drain line on the hydraulic engine driven pump (EDP) on the number 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2 and number 3 engines with improved fire resistant coupling halves. That action was 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
prompted by a fire resistance test of the hydraulic EDP, associated hoses, and couplings 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
installed on the number 2 and number 3 engines, which revealed that the pump case drain 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
line quick release couplings leaked hydraulic fluid. The requirements of that AD are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
intended to prevent hydraulic fluid leakage from the pump case drain line quick release 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
coupling, which could fuel the flames in the event of an engine fire. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Since issuance of that AD, British Aerospace has issued Service Bulletin 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
SB.29&hyph;31&hyph;01339A, Revision 1, dated July 8, 1993, which revises the effectivity listing of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the original issue of the service bulletin by adding the serial numbers of affected Model 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
BAe 146&hyph;100A and &hyph;200A series airplanes. In addition, one Model BAe 146&hyph;300A series 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
airplane, serial number E3220, is removed from the service bulletin effectivity. The Civil 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Aviation Authority (CAA), which is the airworthiness authority for the United Kingdom, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
classified this service bulletin as mandatory in order to assure the continued airworthiness 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of these airplanes in the United Kingdom. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0011 horztab -->
This airplane model is manufactured in the United Kingdom and is type certificated 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for operation in the United States under the provisions of &sect;21.29 of the Federal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Aviation Regulations and the applicable bilateral airworthiness agreement. Pursuant to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
this bilateral airworthiness agreement, the CAA has kept the FAA informed of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
situation described above. The FAA has examined the findings of the CAA, reviewed all 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
available information, and determined that AD action is necessary for products of this type 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
design that are certificated for operation in the United States. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Since an unsafe condition has been identified that is likely to exist or develop on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
other airplanes of the same type design registered in the United States, the proposed AD 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
would supersede AD 93&hyph;24&hyph;05 to continue to require replacement of the quick release 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
coupling halves on each end of the pump case drain line on the hydraulic EDP on the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
number 2 and number 3 engines with improved fire resistant coupling halves. The proposed AD would revise the applicability
of the existing AD, and would reflect the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
latest revision of the service bulletin as the appropriate source of service information. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FAA estimates that 46 airplanes of U.S. registry would be affected by this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proposed AD, that it would take approximately 3 work hours per airplane to accomplish 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the proposed actions, and that the average labor rate is $55 per work hour. Required 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
parts would be provided by the manufacturer at no cost to operators. Based on these 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
figures, the total cost impact of the proposed AD on U.S. operators is estimated to be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
$7,590, or $165 per airplane. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0011 horztab -->
The total cost impact figure discussed above is based on assumptions that no 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
operator has yet accomplished any of the proposed requirements of this AD action, and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that no operator would accomplish those actions in the future if this AD were not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
adopted. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The regulations proposed herein would not have substantial direct effects on the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
States, on the relationship between the national government and the States, or on the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels of government. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Therefore, in accordance with Executive Order 12612, it is determined that this proposal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
would not have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Federalism Assessment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For the reasons discussed above, I certify that this proposed regulation (1) is not a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
``significant regulatory action'' under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
under the DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034, February 26, 1979); 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and (3) if promulgated, will not have a significant economic impact, positive or negative, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
on a substantial number of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Act. A copy of the draft regulatory evaluation prepared for this action is contained in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Rules Docket. A copy of it may be obtained by contacting the Rules Docket at the

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 This document proposes the adoption of a new airworthiness directive (AD) that is applicable to certain Boeing Model
747&hyph;400 series airplanes. This proposal would require a revision to the Flap Control Unit input wiring. This
proposal is prompted by reports of disconnection of the Landing Gear Module electrical connectors, which can result
in the loss of the primary, secondary, and alternate control of the flaps. The actions specified by the proposed AD
are intended to prevent the possibility of an all-flaps-up landing due to the loss of control of all flap operations.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Boeing Commercial Airplanes has advised the FAA of an unsafe condition that may exist in certain Boeing Model 747&hyph;400
series airplanes. Boeing advises that, if the Landing Gear Module connectors become disconnected, all Flap Control
Unit (FCU) modes of flap operation (primary, secondary, and alternate control of flaps) could be lost. There has been
one occurrence of a partial disconnection of these connectors during a flight test of one airplane, which resulted
in some of the flaps failing to extend. In another incident, there was a partial disconnection of these connectors
on one in-service airplane that occurred while the airplane was on the ground; this situation prevented the airplane
from being dispatched. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Disconnection of the subject connectors could result in the loss of all three modes of flap operation. If this were
to occur, the pilot would be unable to change the position of the leading and trailing edge flaps. This condition, if
not corrected, could result in an all-flaps-up (flaps retracted) landing and consequent high landing speeds that
could cause the airplane to run off the runway before being able to stop. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FAA has reviewed and approved Boeing Alert Service Bulletin 747&hyph;27A2346, dated April 28, 1994, that describes
procedures for revising the FCU input wiring by moving two of the three FCU inputs from the ``Alt-Arm'' switch to the
Alternate Flap relays. This will keep the FCU's in the Primary Hydraulic/Pneumatic operation mode if the Landing
Gear Module connectors become disconnected, and would allow the pilot to maintain primary and secondary control
of the flaps. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Since an unsafe condition has been identified that is likely to exist or develop on other products of this same type
design, the proposed AD would require revising the FCU input wiring. The actions would be required to be accomplished
in accordance with the service bulletin described previously.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
There are approximately 300 Model 747&hyph;400 series airplanes of the affected design in the worldwide fleet. The
FAA estimates that 34 airplanes of U.S. registry would be affected by this proposed AD, that it would take approximately
10 work hours per airplane to accomplish the proposed actions, and that the average labor rate is $55 per work hour.
Required parts would cost approximately $200 per airplane. Based on these figures, the total cost impact of the proposed
AD on U.S. operators is estimated to be $25,500, or $750 per airplane.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The total cost impact figure discussed above is based on assumptions that no operator has yet accomplished any of the
proposed requirements of this AD action, and that no operator would accomplish those actions in the future if this
AD were not adopted.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The regulations proposed herein would not have substantial direct effects on the States, on the relationship between
the national government and the States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels
of government. Therefore, in accordance with Executive Order 12612, it is determined that this proposal would not
have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For the reasons discussed above, I certify that this proposed regulation (1) is not a ``significant regulatory action''
under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under the DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44
FR 11034, February 26, 1979); and (3) if promulgated, will not have a significant economic impact, positive or negative,
on a substantial number of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act. A copy of the draft
regulatory evaluation prepared for this action is contained in the Rules Docket. A copy of it may be obtained by contacting
the Rules Docket at the location provided under the caption

On March 2, 1994, the FAA published an NPRM that proposed to alter the Charlotte, NC, Class B airspace area (59 FR 10040).
However, the NPRM was inadvertently published without the associated graphic and with errors to the geographical
references for the Charlotte/Douglas International and Gastonia Municipal Airports. This action will correct
these errors by adding the associated graphic and correcting the geographical references of the airports. This action
will also extend the period for public comments by 30 days.

SUMMARY: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
OSM is announcing receipt of a proposed amendment to the Utah regulatory program and abandoned mine plan (hereinafter,
the ``Utah program'' and ``Utah plan'') under the Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act of 1977 (SMCRA). The
amendment consists of proposed revisions to the Utah Coal Mining and Reclamation Act of 1979. The Utah program revisions
pertain to purpose; definitions of new terms; rulemaking authority and procedure; administrative procedures;
financial interests; permit applications; informal conferences; appeals and further review; performance bonds;
revegetation standards on lands eligible for remining; operator requirements for underground coal mining; information
provided by permittees; contest of violation or amount of penalty; civil actions to compel compliance with Utah's
program; violations of Utah's program or permit conditions; lands unsuitable determination; judicial review of
rules and orders; repeal of specific sections of the Utah Code Annotated 1953 (UCA); and a repeal date of certain provisions.
The Utah plan revisions pertain to lands and water eligible for reclamation, recovery of reclamation costs, and liens.
The amendment is intended to revise Utah's program and plan to be consistent with SMCRA and the Utah Administrative
Procedures Act, and to improve operational efficiency.

Utah proposes to revise UCA 40&hyph;10&hyph;22 pertaining to violations of Utah's program or permit conditions
by (1) requiring at subsection (1)(d) that, where a determination is made that a pattern of violations exists has existed
and the violations were caused by the permittee's unwarranted failure to comply with Utah's program or the conditions
of the permit, the Division will request the Board to issue an order to the permittee to show cause as to why the permit
should not be suspended or revoked and provide an opportunity for a public hearing; if the permittee requests a hearing,
the Board will give notice in accordance with its rules of practice and procedure; and if the permittee fails to show
cause as to why the permit should not be suspended or revoked, the Board will immediately enter an order to suspend or
revoke the permit; (2) adding the word ``district'' before ``court'' at subsection (2)(a) and clarifying that any
relief granted by the district court will continue in effect unless the Utah Supreme Court on review grants a stay of
enforcement or sets aside or modifies the Board's order which is being appealed; (3) providing at subsection (3)(a)
that a permittee or aggrieved person may initiate Board action by requesting a hearing and requiring at subsections
(3)(b) and (d) that the Board will act in accordance with its rules of practice and procedure; (4) changing terms at
subsection (3)(e) from ``issued'' to ``entered'' when describing the outcome of the Board's order and from ``administrative''
to ``adjudicative'' when describing ``proceeding;'' and (5) at subsection (3)(f), providing that the Board's action
is subject to judicial review by the Utah Supreme Court as prescribed in subsection 78&hyph;2&hyph;2(3)(e)(iv),
rather than by the appropriate district court.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Utah proposes the following revisions to its plan provisions.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Utah proposes to revise UCA 40&hyph;10&hyph;25 pertaining to lands and water eligible for reclamation by deleting,
as a priority for the expenditure of AMLR funds, existing subsection (2)(d), which pertains to research and demonstration
projects relating to the development of surface mining reclamation and water quality control program methods and
techniques, and adding new requirements for eligible lands and water to include lands and water left in an inadequate
reclamation status and which meet the criteria of subsection (4) (a) or (b). Utah proposes to allow AMLR funds to be
used for reclamation or drainage abatement at sites (1) where operations occurred during the period beginning August
4, 1977, and ending before January 21, 1981, and where funds pursuant to a loan or other form of financial guarantee
or from any other source are not sufficient to provide for adequate reclamation or abatement at the site and (2) where
operations occurred during the period beginning on August 4,1977, and ending on or before November 5, 1990, and where
the surety of the mining operator became insolvent during that period, and as of November 5,1990, funds immediately
available from proceedings relating to the insolvency, or from any financial guarantee or other source, are not sufficient
to provide for adequate reclamation or abatement at the site. Utah proposes to require that, in determining which
sites to reclaim, priority be given to those sites in the immediate vicinity of a residential area or which have an adverse
economic impact upon a local community. Finally, Utah proposes to provide that (1) surface coal mining operations
on lands eligible for remining do not affect eligibility for reclamation and restoration after the release of the
bond or deposit for the operation, (2) when the bond or deposit for a coal surface mining operation on lands eligible
for remining is forfeited and the amount of the bond or deposit is not sufficient to provide for adequate reclamation
or abatement, AMLR funds may be used for reclamation, and (3) regardless of the provisions above that pertain to operations
on lands eligible for remining, the Director of the Division can expend monies from the abandoned mine reclamation
trust fund for any emergency requiring immediate reclamation.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Utah proposes to revise UCA 40&hyph;10&hyph;28, recovery of reclamation costs and liens against reclaimed land,
by adding new language at subsection (1)(a)(ii) to require that the sale price for land reclaimed using reclamation
funds that is sold to a State or local government for public purposes, may not be less than the actual cost of purchase
of the property by the State plus the costs of reclamation. At subsection (2)(a), Utah proposes that a lien shall not
be placed against reclaimed land where the surface owner owned the land prior to May 2, 1977, and neither consented
to nor participated in nor exercised control over the mining operation that necessitated the reclamation work.

Reform) and has determined that this rule meets the applicable standards of subsections (a) and (b) of that section.
However, these standards are not applicable to the actual language of State regulatory programs and program amendments
since each such program is drafted and promulgated by a specific State, not by OSM. Under sections 503 and 505 of SMCRA
(30 U.S.C. 1253 and 12550) and the Federal regulations at 30 CFR 730.11, 732.15, and 732.17(h)(10), decisions on proposed
State regulatory programs and program amendments submitted by the States must be based solely on a determination
of whether the submittal is consistent with SMCRA and its implementing Federal regulations and whether the other
requirements of 30 CFR Parts 730, 731, and 732 have been met.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
No environmental impact statement is required for this rule since section 702(d) of SMCRA (30 U.S.C. 1292(d)) provides
that agency decisions on proposed State regulatory program provisions do not constitute major Federal Actions within
the meaning of section 102(2)(C) of the National Environmental Policy Act (42 U.S.C. 4332(2)(C)).

5. Regulatory Flexibility Act

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Department of the Interior has determined that this rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial
number of small entities under the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et seq.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
). The State submittal that is the subject of this rule is based upon counterpart Federal regulations for which an economic
analysis was prepared and certification made that such regulations would not have a significant economic effect
upon a substantial number of small entities. Accordingly, this rule will ensure that existing requirements previously
promulgated by OSM will be implemented by the State. In making the determination as to whether this rule would have
a significant economic impact, the Department relied upon the data and assumptions for the counterpart Federal regulations.

Background 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Hine's emerald dragonfly is known to occur in three counties in the Chicago, Illinois, metropolitan area and in
Door County, Wisconsin. It was proposed for listing as an endangered species on the basis of evidence that its range
and numbers have declined dramatically, primarily as a result of the destruction of its habitat, and that the threats
to the habitat are continuing.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On October 4, 1993, the Service published a proposed rule to list the Hine's emerald dragonfly as endangered under
the Endangered Species Act, as amended. The original comment period ended on December 3, and the deadline for receipt
of public hearing requests was November 18. On December 10, 1993, a notice was published reopening the comment period
until January 3, 1994. The Service believes a number of parties interested in the proposed listing did not receive
notice of the proposal in sufficient time to submit comments or request a public hearing during the original comment
period. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On December 20, 1993, the Service received requests for public hearings on this proposal from Mr. Jerome M. Viste,
representing the Door County Environmental Council, Inc., Fish Creek, Wisconsin, and Mr. George M. Reynolds, representing
Reynolds &amp; Co., Milwaukee, Wisconsin. The Service has scheduled a hearing on May 25, 1994, from 7:00 to 9:00 p.m.
C.S.T., at the Door County Courthouse, Sturgeon Bay, Wisconsin. Those parties wishing to make statements for the
record should have available a copy of their statements to be presented to the Service at the start of the hearing. Oral
statements may be limited to 5 or 10 minutes if the number of parties present that evening necessitates some limitation.
Oral and written statements receive equal consideration. There are no limits to the length of written comments presented
at this hearing or mailed to the Service. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In order to accommodate the hearing, the Service also reopens the public comment period. Written comments may be submitted
until June 6, 1994, to the Service office in the

 The Magnuson Fishery Conservation and Management Act (Magnuson Act) requires that each Regional Fishery Management
Council submit any FMP or FMP amendment it prepares to the Secretary for review and approval, disapproval, or partial
disapproval. The Magnuson Act also requires that the Secretary, upon reviewing the plan or amendment, immediately
publish a notice in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 that the plan or amendment is available for public review and comment. The Secretary will consider the public comments
received during the comment period in determining whether to approve these amendments.

The three FMPs and a companion regulatory amendment for the halibut fishery would establish a 3-year moratorium on
the entry of new vessels into the groundfish fishery of the GOA and BSAI, the king and Tanner crab fishery of the BSAI,
and halibut fishery in and off of Alaska. The purpose of the moratorium is to curtail increases in harvesting capacity
and provide industry stability, while the Council assesses long-term management alternatives for its comprehensive
management plan.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The moratorium would be implemented through the issuance of Federal vessel permits for groundfish in the GOA and BSAI,
Federal vessel permits for crab in the BSAI, and International Pacific Halibut Commission (IPHC) vessel permits
for halibut in the Convention waters in and off of Alaska. Vessel permits for these fisheries would be issued only to
vessels that had a historical landing in a moratorium fishery from January 1, 1980, to February 9, 1992.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The companion regulatory amendment would effect changes to rules governing the harvest of Pacific halibut by U.S.
fishermen in and off of Alaska. The Council does not have an FMP for halibut. The domestic fishery for halibut in and
off Alaska is managed by the IPHC, as provided by the Convention between the United States and Canada for the Preservation
of the Halibut Fishery of the Northern Pacific Ocean and the Bering Sea (Convention), and the Northern Pacific Halibut
Act. The Convention and the Halibut Act authorize the respective Regional Fishery Management Councils established
by the Magnuson Act to develop regulations that are in addition to, but not in conflict with, regulations adopted by
the IPHC affecting the U.S. halibut fishery. Under this authority, the Council may develop, for approval by the Secretary,
limited access policies for the Pacific halibut fishery in Convention waters in and off of Alaska. ``Convention waters''
means the maritime areas off the west coast of the United States and Canada as described in Article I of the Convention
(see 16 U.S.C. 773(d)). The Council acted under this authority in recommending its proposed moratorium for the halibut
fishery. Regulations governing the harvesting of Pacific halibut are set forth at 50 CFR parts 301 and 676.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Regulations proposed by the Council to implement these amendments are scheduled to be published within 15 days of
this document.

 NMFS announces that the North Pacific Fishery Management Council (Council) has submitted Amendment 30 to the Fishery
Management Plan (FMP) for the Groundfish Fishery of the Bering Sea and Aleutian Islands Area (BSAI) and Amendment
34 to the FMP for Groundfish of the Gulf of Alaska (GOA) for Secretarial review; comments are requested from the public.
Amendment 30 would raise the sablefish Community Development Quota (CDQ) reserve allocation limit from 12 percent
to 33 percent. This action is intended to allow total allocation of the sablefish CDQ reserve.

Amendment 30 to the FMP for the Groundfish Fishery of the BSAI would raise the allocation limit of sablefish community
development quota reserve for qualified applicants from 12 percent to 33 percent. The 33 percent limit would ensure
that NMFS would be able to allocate 100 percent of the sablefish CDQ reserves to qualified CDQ applicants. Implementation
of Amendment 30 would not change the amount of sablefish available for harvest by fishermen participating in the Pacific
halibut and sablefish individual fishing quota program. The sablefish CDQ reserve, 20 percent of the annual fixed
gear total allowable catch of sablefish for each management area in the BSAI, would be the same under the proposed action
as it is under the current FMP text. Amendment 34 to the FMP for Groundfish of the GOA would correct the inadvertent inclusion
of the CDQ program in that FMP by removing and reserving Section 4.4.1.1.8

Executive Order 12866 encourages Federal agencies to solicit earlier and greater public participation in the development
of regulations. In response, the Assistant Secretary of the Office of Special Education and Rehabilitative Services
(OSERS) and the Acting Commissioner of the Rehabilitation Services Administration (RSA) sent, on December 20, 1993,
over 400 letters, along with computer diskettes that included the most up-to-date draft of the proposed regulations,
to State vocational rehabilitation (VR) agencies, Statewide Independent Living Councils, centers for independent
living (centers), constituent organizations, and other interested parties and individuals, inviting their participation
in a series of public meetings and teleconferences on the proposed regulations. On that same date, the Assistant Secretary
of OSERS and the Acting Commissioner of RSA also made available the draft of the proposed regulations on the ``DIMENET''
and ``RSA BBS'' electronic bulletin boards. Public meetings were held on January 10 and 13 and February 1, 1994. The
teleconferences were conducted on January 24, 25, and 26, 1994. A cross section of individuals representing a wide
variety of independent living (IL) organizations and viewpoints on IL participated. In general, most commenters
were pleased with the draft regulations. The Secretary carefully considered all comments received during the public
meetings and teleconferences.

Because of the time needed to make competitive awards under part C of chapter 1 and under chapter 2 of title VII of the
Act, the Secretary proposes a 30-day comment period for these proposed regulations. As described in the ``Summary
of Major Provisions,'' the Secretary already has revised the proposed regulations in response to the extensive comments
received on the draft of these proposed regulations that was distributed to the public on December 20, 1993. In addition,
the Secretary will make this notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM) available through electronic bulletin boards
on the date of publication of the NPRM in the

regulations.

Summary of Major Provisions 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The following is a summary of the major provisions in these proposed regulations. The summary identifies changes
in the regulations that are mandated by changes in the statute. Other changes described in the summary are regulations
proposed by the Secretary. In addition, significant changes made to the proposed regulations as a result of public
comments received during the public meetings and teleconferences are discussed in this preamble. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition, the Secretary proposes to change all references to ``individual with a severe disability'' to ``individual
with a significant disability.'' The Secretary proposes to define an individual with a significant disability to
mean an individual with a severe physical or mental impairment whose ability to function independently in the family
or community or whose ability to obtain, maintain, or advance in employment is substantially limited and for whom
the delivery of IL services will improve the ability to function, continue functioning, or move toward functioning
independently in the family or community or to continue in employment, respectively. This definition is derived
from the definition of an ``individual with a severe disability'' in section 7(15)(B) of the Act. The Secretary is
concerned that the term ``severe'' has largely negative connotations and associations in common usage and believes
that the term ``significant'' may be preferred by persons with disabilities. Consequently, the Secretary proposes
to use the term ``significant disability'' as a synonym for the term ``severe disability'' in referring to an individual's
disability. No change in meaning is intended by this change in nomenclature.

On October 27, 1993, the Secretary published a separate NPRM in the

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (58 FR 57938) soliciting comments on this proposed change. The comment period on the ``Nomenclature NPRM'' expired
on December 13, 1993. The Secretary received only 37 comments on the change proposed in the ``Nomenclature NPRM,''
with no clear majority in favor or against. These commenters expressed a wide range of views on the proposed change.
Commenters favoring the proposed change generally expressed the view that the term ``significant'' is less pejorative
than the term ``severe'' in referring to an individual's disability and, thus, would support a more positive philosophy.
These comments were generally received from commenters with an interest in the IL services and CIL programs authorized
by title VII of the Act. Commenters opposing the change raised several issues. Some suggested that the proposed change
is not technically accurate and that a change in meaning would result despite departmental assurances to the contrary.
Others suggested that the proposed change would be confusing and burdensome to implement and that the proposed change
should be made through legislation rather than through rulemaking. These comments were generally received from
commenters with an interest in the VR services programs authorized by title I of the Act. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Also on October 27, 1993, the Secretary published a separate NPRM (58 FR 57942) on the indicators of minimum compliance
with the evaluation standards in section 725(b) of the Act. The ``Indicators NPRM'' notified the public of the ``Nomenclature
NPRM'' and advised the public to limit comments on the proposed nomenclature change to the ``Nomenclature NPRM.''
However, many of the comments received on the ``Indicators NPRM'' also included comments on the proposed change in
terms from ``severe'' to ``significant.'' Of the 102 comments on the ``Indicators NPRM,'' only 4 expressed concern
with the proposed change of the term ``severe'' to ``significant.'' Approximately 28 commenters specifically approved
of the proposed change and 24 commenters used the new terminology in their own comments, implicitly indicating their
approval of the proposed change. That is, these 24 commenters used the term ``significant'' instead of the term ``severe''
in their comments, even though they did not specifically approve of the proposed change. The remaining 50 commenters
expressed no views on the proposed change and did not use either of the terms ``severe'' or ``significant'' in their
comments. Based on the number of comments received from the IL community supporting the proposed change from ``severe''
to ``significant'' in the ``Indicators NPRM,'' the Secretary proposes to substitute the term ``significant'' for
the term ``severe'' in this NPRM. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Further support for changing the term ``severe'' to ``significant'' in this NPRM is based on the fact that Congress
totally revised title VII of the Act when it passed the 1992 and 1993 Amendments. The argument that it would be burdensome
to implement the proposed change (e.g., because of the need to revise existing forms and reporting formats) is inapplicable
to implementation of the changes made to the IL programs by the 1992 and 1993 Amendments because the major changes to
title VII of the Act have necessitated major revisions to the regulations implementing title VII. Thus, States and
other recipients of funds under title VII will have to make extensive revisions (e.g., in existing regulations, forms,
and reporting formats) to be consistent with these changes and substituting the term ``significant'' for ``severe''
as part of these revisions would not add any significant additional burden.

Part 364
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Proposed part 364 contains general provisions that would be applicable to the SILS and CIL programs, authorized by
parts B and C, respectively, of chapter 1 of title VII of the Act. In addition, some provisions in proposed part 364 also
are made specifically applicable to the OIB program authorized by chapter 2 of title VII of the Act.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Proposed &sect;364.4 lists the definitions that apply to these programs, including ``administrative support services,''
``advocacy,'' ``attendant care,'' ``cross-disability,'' ``individual with a significant disability,'' ``minority
group,'' ``nonresidential,'' ``peer relationships,'' ``peer role models,'' ``service provider,'' ``significant
disability,'' ``transportation,'' and ``unserved and underserved.''
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The definition of ``administrative support services'' is based on the State plan requirement in section 704(c) of
the Act regarding the State's role if the CIL program is administered by the State pursuant to section 723 of the Act.
The definition of ``cross-disability'' is based on section 725(b)(2) of the Act. The definition of an ``individual
with a significant disability'' is the definition of ``individual with a severe disability'' used in section 7(15)(B)
of the Act. The definition of ``service provider'' is derived from the manner in which this term is used in section 704(e)
of the Act. The definition of ``significant disability'' is derived from section 7(15)(B) of the Act. The definition
of ``unserved and underserved'' is derived from sections 704(l), 713(7), and 725(c)(10) and (11) of the Act and the
legislative history of these statutory provisions.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The definitions of ``attendant care'' and ``transportation'' are based on the definitions of these terms found in
&sect;365.1(c)(3) of the existing regulations for the SILS. The definition of ``advocacy'' is the same definition
used in the Client Assistance Program (CAP) authorized under section 112 of the Act. The definition of ``minority
group'' is based on the general definition of this term used by the U.S. Department of Education (ED). Finally, the
definitions of ``nonresidential,'' ``peer relationships,'' and ``peer role models'' are derived from the generally
accepted understanding of these terms in the IL community.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Proposed &sect;364.5 would not allow the use of expenditures made with non-Federal funds in a particular fiscal year
as an allowable cost to offset any costs disallowed in a notice of disallowance decision or preliminary departmental
decision unless the expenditures were reported as costs charged to the program on the final financial status reports
for that program prior to the commencement of the audit or compliance review that formed the basis for the disallowance.
This provision is designed to lessen the confusion surrounding the use of unreported costs as an offset against disallowed
costs and to lessen the litigation costs associated with this practice. This provision also incorporates the Department's
current practice with respect to programs under the Act.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Proposed &sect;364.6 would define and address the use of ``program income'' for grantees under the IL programs authorized
under title VII of the Act. Program income could be used for additional program expenditures or as a deduction from
total allowable costs, but not to meet the non-Federal share requirement under 34 CFR 365.12(b).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Proposed &sect;364.7 would incorporate section 19 of the Act that permits the carryover of unobligated Federal funds
from one fiscal year to the next. However, pursuant to the 1993 Amendments, proposed &sect;364.7(b) would not permit
recipients of discretionary grants under sections 722 and 752 of the Act to carry over Federal funds.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Proposed &sect;364.13 would implement section 706(a) of the Act concerning when the Secretary may withhold, reduce,
limit, or terminate payments to a State under chapter 1 of title VII of the Act. The Secretary has revised proposed &sect;364.13
to make it more consistent with section 107(c), which is incorporated into title VII of the Act through section 706(a)(2)(A).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Proposed &sect;364.20 would implement the State plan requirements in section 704 of the Act. These requirements
relate to the State plan's form and content, duration (three years), development, and periodic review and revision
(at least once every three years), and to public hearings on the State plan.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Proposed &sect;364.20(c) would incorporate the requirement in section 704(a)(2) of the Act that the designated
State unit (DSU) and the Statewide Independent Living Council (SILC) must jointly develop the State's IL plan and
that the Director of the DSU and the chairperson of the SILC must jointly sign the State's IL plan.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Proposed &sect;&sect;364.20(d) and 364.22(c) would incorporate the statutory requirement in section 704(a) as
it applies to the development and submission of a State's IL plan under section 704 of the Act and part 364. Section 704
of the Act requires a single State IL plan to be developed and signed by the DSU and the SILC. Nothing in the language of
section 704 permits a DSU for individuals who are blind to submit a separate State IL plan for serving individuals who
are blind. However, &sect;364.20(d) of the proposed regulations would require that, in a State where there is a separate
State agency that is the sole State agency authorized by law to provide IL services to individuals who are blind, that
separate agency for individuals who are blind also must be included in the development of, and sign, the State IL plan.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Proposed &sect;364.20(e) would require an assurance in the State plan that the DSU actively consults with the Director
of the CAP authorized by section 112 of the Act during the development of the State plan.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Proposed &sect;364.20(g) would require an assurance in the State plan that the DSU conducts public meetings to provide
all segments of the public, including interested groups, organizations, and individuals, an opportunity to comment
on the State plan prior to its submission to the Secretary and on any revisions to the approved State plan. The Secretary
revised proposed &sect;364.20(g) to explain more comprehensively what a State is expected to do to comply with section
704 (a) and (m)(6) of the Act.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Finally, proposed &sect;364.20(h) would require an assurance in the State plan that, at the public meetings to develop
the State plan, the DSU identifies those provisions in the State plan that are State-imposed requirements (i.e.,
requirements imposed by State rule or policy that are beyond what would be required to comply with the regulations
in proposed 34 CFR parts 364, 365, 366, and 367).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In response to public comment on the draft regulations, the Secretary has added language to proposed &sect;364.21
that establishes the SILC's responsibility for funds it receives under section 705(e) of the Act and protects the
SILC's independence. In addition, the Secretary has added language to this section that requires the State plan to
include a description of the resource plan for the SILC that is required by section 705(e) of the Act.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Proposed &sect;&sect;364.23 and 364.24 would revise the staffing and staff development requirements in existing
34 CFR 365.6 and 365.7 to reflect the changes made by the 1992 Amendments (Pub. L. 102&hyph;569) and the 1993 Amendments
(Pub. L. 103&hyph;73). These requirements would apply to all service providers.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Proposed &sect;364.23(a) would require the State plan to include an assurance that service providers have personnel
who are specialists in the development and provision of IL services to individuals with significant disabilities
and in the development of and support to centers for independent living (centers). Proposed &sect;364.23(b) would
require the State plan to include an assurance that service providers have personnel available who are able to communicate
with applicants for and recipients of IL services under title VII of the Act who need special modes of communication
or whose English proficiency is limited. In response to public comment on the draft regulations, the Secretary added
language to this section to include specific examples of special modes of communication that should be available
for individuals who need special modes of communication. Finally, proposed &sect;364.24 would require the State
plan to include an assurance that the service provider has adequate staff development programs to ensure that staff
are able to provide quality services to meet the needs of individuals with significant disabilities.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
These proposed staffing requirements, which are in &sect;&sect;365.6 and 365.7 of the existing regulations for
the SILS program, are consistent with section 504 of the Act, the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (Pub. L. 101&hyph;336,
42 U.S.C. 12101&hyph;12213), and title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 (Pub. L. 88&hyph;352, 42 U.S.C. 2000d&hyph;2000d&hyph;6).
These proposed staffing requirements have proven useful in the past, and centers have identified staff development
as a significant area of need. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Proposed &sect;364.28 would implement the statutory requirement that a State must incorporate into the State plan
required by section 704 of the Act any new methods or approaches for the provision of IL services to older individuals
who are blind that are developed under a project funded under chapter 2 of title VII of the Act. A DSU would be required
to incorporate into and describe in the State plan any new methods or approaches that are developed under a project
funded under chapter 2 of title VII of the Act that the DSU determines to be effective. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In response to public comment on the draft regulations, the Secretary has added language to proposed &sect;364.30
that would require service providers to provide information about the CAP in formats that are accessible to individuals
who seek or receive IL services. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Proposed &sect;364.40(a) would incorporate the statutory provision that makes any individual with a significant
disability eligible for IL services under the SILS and CIL programs. In addition, proposed &sect;364.40(b) would
make it clear that any individual could seek information about IL services under these programs and request referral
to other services and programs for individuals with significant disabilities, as appropriate. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Proposed &sect;364.41 would require the State to provide an assurance that eligibility requirements are applied
in a nondiscriminatory manner and that no State or local residence requirement will be imposed for IL services. The
purpose of the prohibition on a residency requirement is to ensure continuity of services if an individual moves from
one State to another during the time he or she is receiving IL services. Proposed &sect;364.41 is consistent with section
101(a)(14) of the Act regarding the prohibition on residency requirements for VR services. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In response to public comment on the draft regulations, the Secretary has specified additional information that
would have to be included in the statement of the objectives that would be required by proposed &sect;364.42. The Secretary
believes that the statement of objectives required by section 704(d) of the Act should reflect the importance of this
part of the State plan to the State IL services programs and address the overall goals and mission of the State's IL programs
and services, the various priorities for services and populations to be served (including the priorities established
by centers pursuant to section 725(c)(4) of the Act), the types of services to be provided, the financial plan for the
use of Federal and non-Federal funds to meet the objectives in the State plan, and how funds received under sections
711, 721, and 752 of the Act will further the objectives in the State plan. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Proposed &sect;364.43(b) would incorporate the statutory requirements in section 704(e) and (f) of the Act. Section
704(e) of the Act requires that the State must provide IL services to individuals with a significant disability with
Federal, State, or other funds. Proposed &sect;364.43(b) would permit a State to meet its statutory mandate under
section 704(e) with Federal, State, or other funds. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Proposed &sect;364.43(e) would incorporate the statutory requirement in section 725(b)(2) of the Act that, in the
determination of eligibility, if a State contracts with or awards a grant for the general operation of a center, it
must delegate to the center all functions related to the determination of eligibility for services. If a State contracts
with or awards a grant for the provision of specific IL services to individuals, the State may choose either to delegate
to the IL service provider all authority for the determination of eligibility for these services and for the development
of an IL plan for individuals receiving these services or to retain this authority. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Proposed &sect;&sect;364.50 through 364.56 would impose post-award conditions on the State and its subgrantees
or contractors regarding the processing of referrals and applications (&sect;364.50), determinations of eligibility
and ineligibility (&sect;364.51), initiation and development of an IL plan (&sect;364.52), maintenance of consumer
service records (&sect;364.53), prohibition on durational limitations for IL services (&sect;364.54), compliance
with standards for service providers (&sect;364.55), and procedures for the protection, use, and release of personal
information (&sect;364.56). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Proposed &sect;&sect;364.51, 364.52, and 364.53 would incorporate sections 704(e) and 725(b)(2) of the Act. In
addition, proposed &sect;364.53 would be consistent with the proposed indicators of what constitutes compliance
with the evaluation standards in section 725(b) of the Act.

Proposed &sect;&sect;364.54, 364.55, and 364.56 would keep important protections for consumers of IL services
that exist in the current SILS regulations. In particular, the Secretary revised proposed &sect;364.56 to make it
more consistent with the current SILS regulations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Proposed &sect;364.57 also would permit the DSU to delegate its functions and responsibilities under proposed &sect;&sect;364.50,
364.51 (subject to proposed &sect;364.43(d)), 364.52, 364.53, and 364.56 to the service provider to which the DSU
awards a grant or with which the DSU contracts to provide IL services in the State. Allowing the DSUs to delegate these
functions and responsibilities permits the States greater flexibility in the operation of the SILS program. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In response to public comment on the draft regulations, the Secretary has added a new proposed &sect;364.58 that would
require each service provider to establish appeals procedures and policies that an individual could use to obtain
review of decisions made by the service provider concerning the individual's request for IL services or the provision
of IL services to the individual. Proposed &sect;364.58 also would require the service provider to inform each individual
who seeks or receives IL services about those appeals procedures and policies in formats that are accessible to individuals
who seek or receive IL services. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Proposed &sect;364.59 would require a State to include in its State plan any financial needs test that would be used
by a service provider to determine whether an individual with a significant disability could obtain IL services at
no cost to the individual. Proposed &sect;364.59(d)(1) would require a service provider to maintain written policies
covering the specific types of IL services for which a financial needs test could be applied and to maintain documentation
of an individual's participation in the costs of any IL services.

Part 365 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Proposed part 365 contains regulations for the SILS program authorized by part B of chapter 1 of title VII of the Act.
Pursuant to proposed &sect;365.11(c), if a State has designated a DSU to provide IL services for the general population
of individuals with disabilities and a separate DSU to provide IL services for individuals who are blind, the State
would have total discretion, without any interference from ED, to determine how it would divide the funds allotted
to the State under part 365 between these two DSUs. The division of funds is a matter internal to the States, and the regulations
would not exclude or mandate the involvement of the SILC in this decision. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Proposed &sect;365.13 would impose requirements that a State would have to meet to satisfy its non-Federal share
matching requirement under section 712(b) of the Act and proposed &sect;365.12. Proposed &sect;365.13(b) would
prohibit a State from using cash contributions to satisfy its non-Federal share matching requirement if the contribution
is for expenditures that benefit or will benefit in any way the donor, an individual to whom the donor is related by blood
or marriage or with whom the donor has a close personal relationship, or an individual, entity, or organization with
whom the donor shares a financial interest. Pursuant to proposed &sect;365.13(c), the receipt of a grant, subgrant,
or contract under section 713 of the Act or a grant, subgrant, or assistance contract under section 723 of the Act from
the DSU would not be considered a benefit to the donor if the grant, subgrant, or contract was awarded under the State's
regular competitive procedures. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Conversely, proposed &sect;365.14(a) would prohibit a State from conditioning the award of a grant, subgrant, or
contract under section 713 of the Act or a grant, subgrant, or assistance contract under section 723 of the Act on a cash
or in-kind contribution from an applicant. Proposed &sect;365.14(b) also would prohibit an individual, entity,
or organization that is a grantee or subgrantee of the State, or has a contract with the State, from conditioning the
award of a subgrant or subcontract on a cash or in-kind contribution to the State or to the grantee or contractor of the
State. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Proposed &sect;365.15 would impose the restrictions in &sect;365.14 on a State's use of in-kind contributions to
meet the matching requirement in section 712(b) of the Act. The Secretary has not proposed to impose on in-kind contributions
the restrictions in &sect;365.13 because fewer problems have arisen in the past as a result of the use of this type of
contribution for matching purposes. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed limitations on the use of restricted contributions to meet a State's matching requirement would clarify
the limitations in existing 34 CFR part 365. (See existing 34 CFR 361.76, which is incorporated by reference into the
existing SILS program regulations by existing 34 CFR 365.15.) The proposed limitations would prevent States from
making awards based on an applicant's ability to contribute the matching funds rather than on the programmatic merit
of the applicant's proposal. The proposed limitations would not prohibit a State from accepting restricted contributions
for providing services or benefits to a particular individual or group of individuals. The proposed limitations
would prohibit a State only from using these restricted contributions to meet its matching share requirement if the
donor of the cash contributions has restricted their use to expenditures that benefit or will benefit in any way the
donor, an individual to whom the donor is related by blood or marriage or with whom the donor has a close personal relationship,
or an individual, entity, or organization with whom the donor shares a financial interest.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposed limitations on the use of restricted contributions to meet a State's matching requirement would ensure
that the services and benefits that are provided under a program funded with 90 percent Federal money would be available
to an eligible individual without regard to the individual's relationship to the donor. The proposed limitations
also would ensure that an eligible applicant that is unable to contribute the State's share of expenditures for the
program would not be disqualified from receiving a grant, subgrant, or contract under the program. To allow a State
to condition the award of a grant, subgrant, or contract on the recipient's contribution of the State's matching requirement
would be tantamount to allowing the State to impose additional eligibility requirements to participate in the program.
This action would contradict 34 CFR 76.770(g), which prohibits a State from acting in any manner that prevents eligible
applicants from applying under the program. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Finally, the proposed limitations on the use of restricted contributions to meet a State's matching requirement
also are intended to prevent the sale of grants, subgrants, or contracts by the States to the highest bidder. ED has
always required, unless directed by law to do otherwise, that the award of grants, subgrants, or contracts by States
be made under a fair competitive process that is free from favoritism on the assumption that fair competition will
result in the best qualified applicant receiving the grant, subgrant, or contract. To allow a State to award a grant,
subgrant, or contract on the basis of the amount that the eligible applicant can contribute to the State's matching
requirement would be inconsistent with the advantages that ED has always presumed result from fair competition.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Proposed &sect;365.16 would implement the requirements in Office of Management and Budget (OMB) Circulars A&hyph;87
and A&hyph;122 that the following must be treated as a reduction of expenditures charged to the grant, subgrant, or
contract awarded under part 365 and may not be used for meeting the State's matching requirement: Rebates, deductions,
refunds, discounts, or reductions to the price of goods, products, equipment, rental property, real property, or
services; and premiums, bonuses, gifts, and any other payments related to the purchase of goods, products, equipment,
rental property, real property, or services.

the Act. As stated previously, section 704(e) of the Act requires that the State must provide IL services to individuals
with a significant disability. Section 704(f) of the Act permits the State to provide these IL services through grants
or contracts with third parties. Section 713 of the Act permits the State to use funds received under part B of chapter
1 of title VII of the Act to provide the resources described in section 705(e) of the Act relating to the SILC and to fund
various activities related to IL services and centers. Proposed &sect;365.20(a) would permit the State to use funds
received under part B of chapter 1 of title VII of the Act to provide the IL services required pursuant to section 704(e)
of the Act. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Proposed &sect;365.21(b) would allow a State to provide information and referral services independent of other
IL services. Frequently, individuals without a disability seek information from centers on behalf of an individual
with a significant disability. Allowing States to provide information and referral services furthers the dissemination
of information and the provision of IL services to individuals with significant disabilities. Proposed &sect;365.21(b)
also would allow a State to provide information and referral services without regard to subpart G of part 366. (Subpart
G includes the indicators of what constitutes minimum compliance with the evaluation standards in section 725(b)
of the Act and was published separately in the October 27, 1993 ``Indicators NPRM'' referred to previously. When these
regulations are published in final, subpart G will be included in 34 CFR part 366, along with any changes made to Subpart
G as a result of the public comment received on the ``Indicators NPRM.'') 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Proposed &sect;365.23 identifies the Education Department General Administrative Regulations and requirements
that would apply if a State makes a subgrant or enters into a contract. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Proposed &sect;365.30 would require the DSU to develop, establish, and maintain written standards and procedures
to be applied by the service provider to ensure expeditious and equitable handling of referrals and applications
for IL services from individuals with significant disabilities. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Proposed &sect;365.31 would require the DSU to develop, establish, and maintain written standards for the provision
of IL services to be met by service providers that do not meet the standards and assurances in section 725 of the Act and
Subparts F and G of 34 CFR part 366 and that are used by the DSU to provide IL services to individuals with significant
disabilities. Proposed &sect;365.31 also would require the DSU to assure that participating service providers
meet all applicable State licensure or certification requirements. Providers used by the DSU to provide IL services
that meet the requirements of section 725 of the Act and proposed subparts F and G of part 366 would not have to meet the
standards developed by the DSU if the standards developed by the DSU are different than the Federal requirements.
The requirements for written standards in &sect;&sect;365.30 and 365.31, which existed in the former regulations
for the SILS program, provide important protections for consumers of IL services.

Part 366 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Proposed part 366 contains regulations regarding the CIL program authorized by part C of chapter 1 of title VII of the
Act. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under proposed &sect;366.2(b), the expansion of an existing center through the establishment of a physically separate
and complete facility at a different geographical location would be considered the same as establishing a new center
for purposes of section 722(d) of the Act and proposed &sect;&sect;366.24 and 366.25, which would establish the procedures
for making an award to a new center. This proposed provision would facilitate the expansion of the CIL program and the
establishment of statewide networks of centers through the use of the expertise of currently existing centers. However,
pursuant to proposed &sect;366.22(a)(1), any funds received by an existing center to establish a new center at a different
geographical location pursuant to proposed &sect;366.2(b)(2) would not be included in determining the level of
funding to the existing center in any fiscal year that the new center applies for and receives funds as a separate center.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Proposed &sect;366.3 lists the various activities that the Secretary is authorized by statute to fund under the CIL
program. Pursuant to proposed &sect;366.3(a), an eligible agency may use funds awarded under subpart B of this part
to carry out training and technical assistance activities described in proposed &sect;366.11(b). Pursuant to proposed
&sect;366.3(b), an eligible agency may use funds under Subparts C and D of Part 366 to plan, conduct, administer, and
evaluate centers, and to carry out activities that would further a center's compliance with the evaluation standards
in section 725(b) of the Act and with the assurances in section 725(c) of the Act. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Pursuant to proposed &sect;366.14, the Secretary would use the selection criteria in proposed &sect;366.15 to evaluate
applications from entities with experience in the operation of centers for awards to provide training and technical
assistance to eligible agencies, centers, and SILCs to plan, develop, conduct, administer, and evaluate centers.
The selection criteria are based on section 721(b) of the Act and &sect;75.210 of the Education Department General
Administrative Regulations (EDGAR). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Proposed &sect;&sect;366.20 through 366.28 would incorporate the statutory requirements that apply if the amount
of Federal funds allotted to the State under section 721(c) and (d) of the Act to support the general operation of centers
is greater than the amount of State funds earmarked for the same purpose, as determined pursuant to proposed &sect;&sect;366.30
and 366.31, or that apply even if this condition is met but the Director of the DSU (Director) does not submit to the Secretary
and obtain approval of an application to award grants under section 723 of the Act and proposed &sect;366.32.

Pursuant to proposed &sect;366.22(b) if, after meeting the priorities in proposed &sect;366.22(a)(1) and (2),
there are insufficient funds under the State's allotment to fund a new center under proposed &sect;366.22(a)(3),
the Secretary may use the excess funds in the State to assist existing centers or may reallot these funds in accordance
with section 721(d) of the Act. This proposed provision is designed to give the Secretary added flexibility to respond
to the local needs within a State. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Pursuant to proposed &sect;366.26, the Secretary would use the statutory selection criteria from section 722(d)(2)(B)
of the Act, as incorporated in proposed &sect;366.27, to evaluate applications for awards to centers under section
722 of the Act. In response to public comment on the draft regulations, the Secretary has increased the value of the
``Extent of the need for the project'' from 15 to 20 points and decreased the value of the ``Plan of operation'' from
25 to 20 points in proposed &sect;366.27 (a) and (g), respectively. The Secretary also has added language to the selection
criterion on the ``Extent of the need for the project'' that would encourage an applicant to provide information on
whether the applicant proposes to serve an area that has been identified in the State plan as a priority service area.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Proposed &sect;366.28 would clarify existing authority implicit in the Act permitting the Secretary to use funds
from the allotment of one State to award a grant to a center located in another State if the Secretary determines that
the proposal of the out-of-State center to serve individuals with significant disabilities who reside in the other
State is consistent with the State plan of the State in which these individuals reside. Nothing in the Act limits the
award of funds allotted to a State under section 721 of the Act to eligible agencies only in that State. This proposed
provision would allow the Secretary to fund the most qualified applicant and would facilitate the provision of services
to unserved and underserved areas in a State in the most efficient and economical manner. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Proposed &sect;&sect;366.29 through 366.38 would incorporate the statutory requirements applicable if the Director
submits to the Secretary and obtains approval of an application to award grants under section 723 of the Act and proposed
&sect;366.32 and the amount of State funds earmarked to support the general operation of centers is equal to or greater
than the amount of Federal funds allotted to the State for the same purpose, as determined pursuant to proposed &sect;&sect;366.29
and 366.31. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Proposed &sect;366.29(a)(2) would incorporate section 723(a)(1)(A)(i) of the Act. Pursuant to proposed &sect;366.29(a)(2),
if a State submits an application for a fiscal year to award grants under section 723 of the Act and subpart D of 34 CFR
part 366, the Secretary would determine whether the amount of State funds that were earmarked by the State to support
the general operation of centers meeting the requirements of part C of chapter 1 of title VII of the Act in the second
fiscal year preceding the fiscal year for which the application is submitted equaled or exceeded the amount of funds
allotted to the State under section 721 (c) and (d) of the Act (or part B of title VII of the Act as in effect on October 28,
1992) for that preceding fiscal year. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Pursuant to proposed &sect;366.29(c), the second fiscal year preceding the fiscal year for which the State submits
an application to administer the CIL program under section 723 of the Act and subpart D of 34 CFR part 366 would be considered
the ``preceding fiscal year'' for purposes of section 723(a)(1)(A)(iii) of the Act. For example, if fiscal year (FY)
1995 is the fiscal year for which the State submits an application to administer the CIL program under this subpart,
FY 1993 would be the ``preceding fiscal year.'' The Secretary chose the second fiscal year preceding the fiscal year
for which the State submits an application to administer the CIL program as the ``preceding fiscal year'' because
that year would be the most recent year for which complete financial data would be available to the Secretary to make
his determination. The Secretary would make any adjustments necessary to accommodate a State's multi-year funding
cycle or fiscal year that does not coincide with the Federal fiscal year. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Pursuant to proposed &sect;366.30(a), the amount of State funds that are earmarked by a State to support the general
operation of centers would not include: (1) Federal funds used for the general operation of centers; (2) State funds
used to purchase services from a center, including State funds used for grants or contracts for personal assistance
or skills training; (3) State attendant care funds; or (4) Social Security Administration reimbursement funds.
Proposed &sect;366.30(c) implements congressional intent as expressed in S. Rep. No. 102&hyph;357, 102d Cong.,
2d Sess. 92 (1992). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Pursuant to proposed &sect;366.30(b), ``earmarked funds'' would mean funds appropriated by the State and expressly
or clearly identified as State expenditures in the relevant fiscal year for the sole purpose of funding the general
operation of centers. ``Earmarked funds'' would be described in this manner for purposes of this proposed provision
to ensure consistency among the States for what should be included as ``earmarked funds.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Pursuant to proposed &sect;366.31, if the State submits an application to administer the CIL program under section
723 of the Act and subpart D of 34 CFR part 366 for a fiscal year, but did not earmark the amount of State funds required
by proposed &sect;366.29(a)(2) in the preceding fiscal year, the State would be ineligible to make grants under section
723 of the Act and subpart D of 34 CFR part 366 after the end of the fiscal year succeeding the preceding fiscal year and
for each succeeding fiscal year.

 A State meets the earmarking requirement in FY 1995. However, in reviewing the State's application to administer
the CIL program in FY 1998, the Secretary determines that the State failed to meet the earmarking requirement in FY
1996. The State could continue to award grants in FY 1997 but could not do so in FY 1998 and succeeding fiscal years.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Once the Secretary determines that a State failed to earmark the required amount of funds in the second fiscal year
preceding the fiscal year for which the State submits an application to administer the CIL program, the State would
be precluded from administering the CIL program in succeeding fiscal years. The Secretary believes that this proposed
result most clearly reflects the intent of Congress. The Secretary also believes that allowing States to re-qualify
would be disruptive to the consistent administration of the CIL program within a State. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In those States in which there is both a DSU responsible for providing IL services to the general population and a DSU
responsible for providing IL services for individuals who are blind, proposed &sect;366.32(d) would provide that
the word ``Director,'' as used in subparts D and E of part 366, would mean ``the Director of the general DSU.'' This provision
is proposed because only the general agency in a State has authority under State law to provide IL services on a cross-disability
basis. However, both State units would be required to consult with each other with respect to the provision of services
for individuals who are blind. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Because the Department distinguishes between procurement contracts and assistance contracts at the State level,
proposed &sect;366.32(e) would permit the Director to enter into assistance contracts with centers to carry out
section 723 of the Act. The Department considers assistance contracts awarded by a State as equivalent to subgrants.
Proposed &sect;366.32(e) would define an assistance contract awarded by a State as an instrument whose principal
purpose is merely to transfer funds allotted to the State under section 721 (c) and (d) of the Act and 34 CFR part 366 to
an eligible agency to carry out section 723 of the Act rather than as an instrument to procure services under specific
terms and conditions determined by the Director. If the DSU were to use an assistance contract to award funds under
section 723 of the Act, the DSU would not be permitted to add any requirements, terms, or conditions to the assistance
contract other than those that would be permitted if the assistance contract were a subgrant. Under an assistance
contract, the DSU would assume a role consistent with that of the Secretary under section 722 of the Act; i.e., the role
of the DSU would be to ensure that the terms of the assistance contract (which are established by chapter 1 of title VII
of the Act and the implementing regulations in 34 CFR parts 364, 365, and 366) are satisfied. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Conversely, proposed &sect;366.32(f) would implement congressional intent to prohibit the Director from entering
into procurement contracts with centers to carry out section 723 of the Act. See H.R. Rep. No. 102&hyph;822, 102d Cong.,
2d Sess. 137 (1992) and S. Rep. No. 102&hyph;357, 92. Proposed &sect;366.32(f) would define a procurement contract
as an instrument whose principal purpose is to acquire (by purchase, lease, or barter) property or services for the
direct benefit or use of the DSU. Under a procurement contract, the DSU prescribes the specific services it intends
to procure and the terms and conditions of the procurement. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Pursuant to proposed &sect;366.32(g), in the enforcement of any breach of the terms and conditions of an assistance
contract, the DSU would be required to follow the procedures established in proposed &sect;&sect;366.40 through
366.45. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Pursuant to proposed &sect;366.34(b), if the order of priorities in proposed &sect;366.22 is followed and, after
meeting the priorities in proposed &sect;366.22(a) (1) and (2), there are insufficient funds under the State's allotment
under section 721 (c) and (d) of the Act to fund a new center under proposed &sect;366.22(a)(3), the Director would
be permitted to use any excess funds in the State to assist existing centers or to return these funds to the Secretary
for reallotment in accordance with section 721(d) of the Act. Proposed &sect;366.34(b) would give the Director of
a DSU the same discretion that the Secretary would have under proposed &sect;366.22(b). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Proposed &sect;&sect;366.39 through 366.45 would establish the enforcement and appeals procedures if the Secretary
or the Director determines that a center receiving funds under section 722 or 723, respectively, of the Act is not in
compliance with the standards and assurances in section 725 (b) and (c) of the Act and subparts F and G of part 366. Pursuant
to section 722(g)(1) of the Act, if the Secretary determines that a center receiving funds under section 722(a) of
the Act is not in compliance with the standards and assurances in section 725(b) of the Act, the Secretary is required
to notify the center of the center's noncompliance. Pursuant to section 722(g)(2) of the Act, the Secretary is required
to terminate funds 90 days after notifying a center that it is not in compliance with the standards and assurances in
section 725(b) of the Act unless the center submits a corrective action plan to achieve compliance within 90 days after
the Secretary's notification and the plan is approved by the Secretary. Proposed &sect;366.39 (a) and (b) would implement
section 722(g) (1) and (2) of the Act. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Pursuant to proposed &sect;366.39(a), the Secretary would notify the center that the Secretary will offer technical
assistance to a center to develop a corrective action plan to comply with the standards and assurance. Pursuant to
proposed &sect;366.39(b)(2), the Secretary would notify the center that termination of funds would occur within
90 days after the center received notice of its noncompliance unless the center requests a hearing pursuant to proposed
&sect;366.39 (c) or (d). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Proposed &sect;366.39(c) would give a center 30 days from the date it receives the Secretary's written notice disapproving

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Pursuant to proposed &sect;366.39(f), the Secretary would issue a written decision to terminate funds after a hearing
if the center is found out of compliance with the standards and assurances in section 725(b) of the Act and subparts
F and G of 34 CFR part 366 or the center's corrective action plan cannot be approved.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Proposed &sect;&sect;366.40 through 366.43 would incorporate similar statutory requirements related to enforcement
and appeals procedures that the Director shall use before terminating a center's funds or taking other significant
adverse action against a center. The due process procedures in proposed &sect;&sect;366.40 through 366.43 are designed
to provide every opportunity for a dispute between a Director and a center to be resolved at the State level before the
dispute is appealed to the Secretary. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Pursuant to proposed &sect;366.40(b), unless a center submits and obtains approval of a corrective action plan,
the Director would terminate all funds to a center under section 723 of the Act 90 days after the date that the center
receives the initial written notice of its noncompliance from the Director or 90 days after the date that the center
receives the Secretary's final decision pursuant to proposed &sect;366.46(c), whichever is later. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Proposed &sect;366.41 describes the minimum amount of information that the Secretary believes the initial written
notice sent from the Director to the center would have to contain to meet the statutory requirement of providing notice
to the center of the center's noncompliance, including notice to the center that it would have 90 days from the date
of receipt of the Director's initial written notice to submit a corrective action plan to the Director and 120 days
from the date of receipt of the Director's initial written notice to appeal to the Secretary the decision described
in a Director's initial written notice. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Pursuant to proposed &sect;366.42, if the center submits a corrective action plan, the Director would have to provide
the center with a final written decision approving or disapproving the center's corrective action plan and informing
the center, if appropriate, of the termination of funds or other proposed significant adverse action against the
center. Pursuant to proposed &sect;366.42(c), a Director's final written decision would not take effect until 30
days after the center receives it or, if appealed to the Secretary, until the Secretary issues a final decision. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Proposed &sect;366.43 describes the minimum amount of information that the Secretary believes the final written
decision from the Director would have to contain to meet the statutory requirement of providing notice to the center
of the center's noncompliance with statutory requirements, including the reasons why the Director could not approve
the center's corrective action plan, if such a plan was submitted by the center, and notice to the center that it has
the right to appeal the Director's final written decision to the Secretary. Proposed &sect;366.44 describes the
procedures that a center would have to follow to appeal to the Secretary a final written decision from the Director.
Pursuant to proposed &sect;366.44(a), if a Director did not approve a center's corrective action plan, the center
would be given 30 days following receipt of the Director's final written decision to appeal to the Secretary. Pursuant
to proposed &sect;366.44(b), if a center does not submit a corrective action plan, the center would be given 120 days
following receipt of the Director's initial written notice to appeal to the Secretary. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Proposed &sect;366.44(c) through (f) describe how a center would file an appeal to the Secretary. Proposed &sect;366.44(g)

All of the proposed provisions in proposed subpart E regarding the enforcement of statutory requirements that centers
must meet are designed to ensure due process and fairness. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In response to public comment on the draft regulations, the Secretary has added language to clarify the intent of proposed
&sect;366.50. Section 725(c)(2) of the Act requires that the governing board of a center must be composed of a majority
of individuals with a significant disability. The statutory definition of an individual with a significant disability
is limited to individuals who are receiving or who could benefit from receiving IL services. If the statutory definition
is used to determine membership on the governing board, those individuals with a significant disability who already
have gained their independence, either through the receipt of IL services or on their own, could not be part of the majority
of the governing board. Therefore, the Secretary has added language at the end of proposed &sect;366.50(b) that would
modify the definition of an individual with a significant disability for purposes of this proposed section only.
The proposed definition would permit those individuals with a significant disability who already have gained their
independence, either through the receipt of IL services or on their own, to be part of the majority of the governing
board.

Part 367 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Proposed part 367 contains regulations regarding the OIB program, authorized by chapter 2 of title VII of the Act.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition to incorporating the definitions in proposed &sect;364.4, proposed &sect;367.5 includes the statutory
definitions for ``older individual who is blind'' and ``independent living services for older individuals who are

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Pursuant to proposed &sect;367.21, the Secretary would use the selection criteria in proposed &sect;367.22, which
are based on &sect;75.210 of EDGAR, to evaluate applications for discretionary grants under section 752(b)(1) of
the Act. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In response to public comment on the draft regulations, the Secretary has increased the value of ``Plan of operation''
from 20 to 25 points and decreased the value of ``Likelihood of sustaining the program'' from 15 to 10 points in proposed
&sect;367.22(b) and (h), respectively. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Pursuant to proposed &sect;367.23, the Secretary also would consider the geographic distribution of projects in
awarding these discretionary grants. The Secretary believes that it is important to have this program operate in
as many States as possible, and this proposed provision would give the Secretary the flexibility to accomplish this
purpose. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Finally, proposed &sect;367.41(a)(1) would incorporate section 752(g) of the Act that gives the designated State
agency discretion to operate or administer the OIB program or projects under Part 367 through grants to public or private
nonprofit agencies or organizations. In addition, proposed &sect;367.41(a)(2) would incorporate section 752(i)(2)(A)
of the Act that gives the designated State agency discretion to operate or administer the program or projects under
Part 367 either directly or through grants, as permitted by section 752(g) of the Act and &sect;367.41(a), or contracts.
The general authority to operate or administer the OIB through grants or contracts given to States in section 752(i)(2)(A)
of the Act is overridden by the specific language in section 752(g) of the Act limiting a State's authority to award
grants only to public or private nonprofit agencies or organizations. Because Congress could have added contracts
to section 752(g) or deleted the very specific reference to public or private nonprofit agencies or organizations
in section 752(g), proposed &sect;367.41(a)(2) permits a State to contract only with individuals, entities, or
organizations that are not public or private nonprofit agencies or organizations. However, proposed &sect;367.41(b)
would permit States to use assistance contracts awarded by a State (which are similar to subgrants), but not procurement
contracts, in a manner consistent with 34 CFR 366.32(e) through 366.32(g).

Assessment of Costs and Benefits

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
These proposed regulations have been reviewed in accordance with Executive Order 12866. Under the terms of the order
the Secretary has assessed the potential costs and benefits of this regulatory action. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The potential costs associated with the proposed regulations are those resulting from statutory requirements and
those determined by the Secretary to be necessary for administering these programs effectively and efficiently.
Burdens specifically associated with information collection requirements, if any, are identified and explained
elsewhere in this preamble under the heading Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In assessing the potential costs and benefits_both quantitative and qualitative_of these proposed regulations,
the Secretary has determined that the benefits of the proposed regulations justify the costs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Secretary also determined that this regulatory action does not unduly interfere with State, local, and tribal
governments in the exercise of their governmental functions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
To assist the Department in complying with the specific requirements of Executive Order 12866, the Secretary invites
comment on whether there may be further opportunities to reduce any potential costs or increase potential benefits
resulting from these proposed regulations without impeding the effective and efficient administration of the program.

Clarity of the Regulations 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Executive Order 12866 requires each agency to write regulations that are easy to understand. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Secretary invites comments on how to make these proposed regulations easier to understand, including answers
to questions such as the following: (1) Are the requirements in the proposed regulations clearly stated? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Do the regulations contain technical terms or other wording that interferes with their clarity? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Does the format of the regulations (grouping and order of sections, use of headings, paragraphing, etc.) aid or
reduce their clarity? Would the regulations be easier to understand if they were divided into more (but shorter) sections?
(A ``section'' is preceded by the symbol ``&sect;'' and a numbered heading; for example, &sect;364.10.) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) Is the description of the regulations in the ``Supplementary Information'' section of this preamble helpful
in understanding the regulations? How could this description be more helpful in making the regulations easier to
understand? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5) What else could the Department do to make the regulations easier to understand? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A copy of any comments that concern how the Department could make these proposed regulations easier to understand
should be sent to Stanley M. Cohen, Regulations Quality Officer, U.S. Department of Education, 400 Maryland Avenue
SW. (room 5125, FOB&hyph;6), Washington, DC 20202&hyph;2241.

Regulatory Flexibility Act Certification 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Secretary certifies that these proposed regulations would not have a significant economic impact on a substantial
number of small entities. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The small entities that would be affected by these proposed regulations are centers receiving Federal funds under
these programs. However, the regulations would not have a significant economic impact on the centers affected because
the regulations would not impose excessive regulatory burdens or require unnecessary Federal supervision. The
regulations would impose minimal requirements to ensure the proper expenditure of program funds.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
State agencies and centers are eligible to apply for grants under these proposed regulations. The Department needs
and uses the information to make grants. Annual public reporting burden for this collection of information is estimated
to average 40 hours per response for 240 respondents, including the time for reviewing instructions, searching existing
data sources, gathering and maintaining the data needed, and completing and reviewing the collection of information.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Organizations and individuals desiring to submit comments on the information collection requirements should direct
them to the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs, OMB, room 3002, New Executive Office Building, Washington,

When may the Director of the designated State unit (DSU) award grants to centers? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(a) The Director of the DSU (Director) may award grants under section 723 of the Act and this subpart to centers in a State
in a fiscal year if_
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) The Director submits to the Secretary and obtains approval of an application to award grants for that fiscal year
under section 723 of the Act and &sect;366.32 (a) and (b); and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) The Secretary determines that the amount of State funds that were earmarked by the State to support the general
operation of centers meeting the requirements of Part C of Chapter 1 of Title VII of the Act in the second fiscal year
preceding the fiscal year for which the application is submitted equaled or exceeded the amount of funds allotted
to the State under section 721 (c) and (d) of the Act (or Part B of Title VII of the Act as in effect on October 28, 1992) for
that preceding fiscal year. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) For purposes of section 723(a)(1)(A)(iii) of the Act and this subpart, the second fiscal year preceding the fiscal
year for which the State submits an application to administer the CIL program is considered the ``preceding fiscal
year.'' 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Example
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
: If FY 1995 is the fiscal year for which the State submits an application to administer the CIL program under this subpart,
FY 1993 is the ``preceding fiscal year.'' In determining the ``preceding fiscal year'' under this subpart, the Secretary
makes any adjustments necessary to accommodate a State's multi-year funding cycle or fiscal year that does not coincide
with the Federal fiscal year.

(a) For purposes of this subpart, the amount of State funds that were earmarked by a State to support the general operation
of centers does not include_
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Federal funds used for the general operation of centers; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) State funds used to purchase services from a center, including State funds used for grants or contracts for personal
assistance or skills training; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) State attendant care funds; or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) Social Security Administration reimbursement funds.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
If the State submits an application to administer the CIL program under section 723 of the Act and this subpart for a
fiscal year, but did not earmark the amount of State funds required by &sect;366.29(a)(2) in the preceding fiscal
year, the State shall be ineligible to make grants under section 723 of the Act and this subpart after the end of the fiscal
year succeeding the preceding fiscal year and for each succeeding fiscal year.

A State meets the earmarking requirement in FY 1994.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
It also meets this requirement in FY 1995. However, in reviewing the State's application to administer the CIL program
in FY 1998, the Secretary determines that the State failed to meet the earmarking requirement in FY 1996. The State
may continue to award grants in FY 1997 but may not do so in FY 1998 and succeeding fiscal years.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(1) Information demonstrating that the amount of funds earmarked by the State for the general operation of centers
meets the requirements in &sect;366.29(a)(1); and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) A summary of the annual reports submitted to the Director from centers in accordance with &sect;366.50(n). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) If the amount of funds earmarked by the State for the general operation of centers meets the requirements in &sect;366.29(a)(1),
the Secretary approves the application and designates the Director to award the grants and carry out section 723 of
the Act. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) If the Secretary designates the Director to award grants and carry out section 723 of the Act under paragraph (b)
of this section, the Director makes grants to eligible agencies in a State, as described in &sect;366.2, for a fiscal
year from the amount of funds allotted to the State under section 721 (c) and (d) of the Act. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(d) (1) In the case of a State in which there is both a DSU responsible for providing IL services to the general population
and a DSU responsible for providing IL services for individuals who are blind, for purposes of subparts D and E of this
part, the ``Director'' shall be the Director of the general DSU. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) The State units described in paragraph (d)(1) of this section shall periodically consult with each other with
respect to the provision of services for individuals who are blind. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(e) The Director may enter into assistance contracts with centers to carry out section 723 of the Act. For purposes
of this paragraph, an assistance contract is an instrument whose principal purpose is to transfer funds allotted
to the State under section 721(c) and (d) of the Act and this part to an eligible agency to carry out section 723 of the
Act. Under an assistance contract, the DSU shall assume a role consistent with that of the Secretary under section
722 of the Act. If the DSU uses an assistance contract to award funds under section 723 of the Act, the DSU may not add any
requirements, terms, or conditions to the assistance contract other than those that would be permitted if the assistance
contract were a grant rather than an assistance contract. Under an assistance contract, as defined in this paragraph,
the role of the DSU is to ensure that the terms of the assistance contract, which are established by Chapter 1 of Title
VII of the Act and the implementing regulations in this part and 34 CFR part 364, are satisfied. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(f) The Director may not enter into procurement contracts with centers to carry out section 723 of the Act. For purposes
of this paragraph, a procurement contract is an instrument whose principal purpose is to acquire (by purchase, lease,
or barter) property or services for the direct benefit or use of the DSU. Under a procurement contract, the DSU prescribes
the specific services it intends to procure and the terms and conditions of the procurement.

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 HUD is proposing to amend its regulations regarding the elimination of hazards due to lead-based paint and inviting
public comments on the amendments. The amendments would remedy inaccuracies and respond to advancements in the state
of knowledge in the field of lead-based paint testing and hazard reduction. This proposed rule would amend both the
Department's basic regulation concerning lead-based paint poisoning prevention in residential structures and
additional regulations pertaining to specific programs of the Department. The changes would include revising the
definitions of an elevated blood-lead level, defective paint and chewable paint; redefining the age of concern for
children subject to lead hazards; providing definitions of hazard reduction methods; adding the option to test defective
paint surfaces and permitting the use of laboratory analysis such as atomic absorption spectrometry (AAS); modifying
approved abatement practices to control lead-based paint dust; revising requirements pertaining to the number
of dwelling units to be sampled under the random sampling provision.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Background 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The existing lead-based paint regulations pertaining to the Department's programs were written pursuant to the
passage of the Lead-Based Paint Poisoning Prevention Act (42 U.S.C. 4801&hyph;4846) in the early 1970s. This legislation
required the Secretary to ``establish procedures to eliminate as far as practicable the hazards of lead-based paint
poisoning with respect to any existing housing which may present such hazards and which is covered by an application
for mortgage insurance or housing assistance payments under a program administered by the Secretary.'' HUD implemented
that requirement by promulgating 24 CFR part 35 in 1976 (41 FR 28878, July 13, 1976). Part 35 includes the general procedures
for the testing and abatement of lead-based paint hazards in HUD-associated housing and applies to all programs.
Section 35.5(c), however, allows each Assistant Secretary to develop regulations pertaining to specific HUD programs.
It is the Department's intent that program-specific regulations define the conditions that require action, but
reference part 35 for specification of how the action should be conducted. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Since part 35 was first written, amendments to it and to the program-specific regulations have been issued from time
to time in response to changes in the law and increased knowledge about the hazards and treatment of lead-based paint.
The most recent Department-wide regulatory revisions pertaining to lead-based paint were made in 1986, 1987, and
1988. Some additional revisions specific to the public and Indian housing programs were issued in 1991. However,
new legislation_specifically the Residential Lead-Based Paint Hazard Reduction Act of 1992 (title X, Pub. L. 102&hyph;550;
approved October 28, 1992) (Title X)_and recent advances in knowledge have again made some of the information in the
existing regulations obsolete. Therefore, the Department is undertaking a comprehensive revision of its lead-based
paint regulations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The changes in this proposed rule would represent the first phase in the revision process. In the first phase, HUD would
correct certain provisions in the regulations that are clearly out of date and should be corrected as soon as possible.
Subsequent revisions will implement Title X, which establishes new requirements effective January 1, 1995. The
Department intends to issue proposed regulations implementing the new Act as soon as possible, to allow the maximum
amount of time for comment and for preparation by State and local agencies and the private sector. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
HUD welcomes comments on the regulatory revisions that are described in this proposed rule.

Revising the Definition of an Elevated Blood-Lead Level 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Current regulations require special procedures if a child has an ``elevated blood-lead level.'' This proposed rule
would change the definition of an elevated blood-lead level (EBL) to conform to the new recommendations of the Department
of Health and Human Services, Centers for Disease Control (CDC), regarding blood lead levels that require environmental
intervention. Existing regulations define an EBL as equal to or exceeding 25 micrograms per deciliter (&mu;g/dl).
The Department's new standard for environmental intervention would be equal to or exceeding 20 &mu;g/dl for a single
test or 15&hyph;19 &mu;g/dl in two consecutive tests several months apart. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Many people are under the impression that the CDC, in its Statement, Preventing Lead Poisoning in Young Children (October
1991), effectively lowered the definition of an EBL to 10 &mu;g/dl. It is true that the Statement indicates that ``the
overall goal is to reduce children's blood lead levels below 10 &mu;g/dl. However, the Statement does not recommend
medical or environmental intervention at levels of 10&hyph;14 &mu;g/dl. Three reasons are given: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
First, particularly at low blood lead levels, laboratory measurements may have some inaccuracy and imprecision,
so a blood lead level in this range (10&hyph;14 &mu;g/dl) may, in fact, be below 10 &mu;g/dl. Second, effective environmental
and medical interventions for children with blood lead levels in this range have not yet been identified and evaluated.
Finally, the sheer numbers of children in this range would preclude effective case management and would detract from
individualized follow-up required by children who have higher blood lead levels.

The definition currently used by HUD of an EBL first appears in 24 CFR 200.805. The revised definition would be included
in 24 CFR 35.3, because the definition affects all residential HUD programs. Specific program regulations could
then reference the definition in part 35 as appropriate, although some program regulations might continue to repeat
the definition.

Definitions To Be Revised

Title X amends the Lead-Based Paint Poisoning Act to change the childhood age of concern from less than 7 years of age
to less than 6 years. This change, which also reflects the advice of the CDC in its Statement, cited above, requires
revisions to HUD's lead-based paint regulations in several locations. For example, the current definition of residential
structure (24 CFR 35.3), includes a reference to nondwelling facilities ``commonly used by children under seven
years of age.'' A similar reference currently is found in 24 CFR 200.815(c), which requires that, in the case of a sale
of a HUD-owned single-family property, if the purchaser is an owner-occupant and the occupant family contains one
or more children under the age of seven years, the sale of a HUD-owned single-family property must be deferred to allow
time to check for elevated blood lead levels and test for and abate lead-based paint. A similar requirement pertains
to multifamily properties (see 24 CFR 200.820(c)(ii) and 24 CFR 200.825(c)(1)). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
HUD also would revise or add definitions of the following terms in 24 CFR 35.22: defective paint, HEPA, HUD-associated
housing, misted scraping, paint removal, replacement, and residential structure.

Options To Test Defective Surfaces and Use Laboratory Analysis 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed rule would provide an option for testing of defective paint surfaces to determine if, in fact, lead-based
paint is present; if the test results are below 1.0 mg/cm
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
2
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, abatement is not required. For structures built prior to 1978, the existing regulations require visual inspection
for defective paint surfaces and treatment of those surfaces found to be defective. Therefore, under the existing
regulations, surfaces that are defective but do not contain lead and are not hazardous may be unnecessarily treated.
Testing the surface is the only way to determine if it is hazardous and thus requires treatment. The revision would
permit a cost review between testing and treatment without testing. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed rule also specifically would permit laboratory analysis as an approved alternative to XRF testing.
Current program regulations require the Federal Housing Commissioner's permission to use laboratory analysis
on a case-by-case basis. This has led to a burdensome and growing number of individual concurrence actions. XRF readings
are given in milligrams per square centimeter (mg/cm2), but laboratories frequently report test results as a percent
of lead by weight. Therefore, an alternative standard of 0.5 percent by weight or 5000 parts per million (ppm) would
be permitted as an alternative to the more widely used standard of 1.0 mg/cm2.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
At the time the existing regulation was written, abatement techniques were not refined and the danger of lead dust
was relatively unknown. Research and experience in both the public and private sectors have advanced the state of
knowledge on these subjects. The proposed rule would reference various abatement methods (defined in 24 CFR 35.22)
that are consistent with the HUD Interim Guidelines and In-Place Management Recommendations. The proposed rule
also would warn about the danger of lead dust. Sections 35.56(a) (1) and (2), concerning requirements applicable
to the sale of federally owned property that will be used for residential purposes, also would be amended in this proposed
rule.

Including Up-to-Date Sampling and Testing Information

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Given the high cost of testing for lead-based paint, it is desirable to follow a statistically sound random sampling
technique that provides satisfactory assurance of detecting lead-based paint, while not requiring the testing
of all units in a multifamily property. Existing regulations for the multifamily mortgage insurance and multifamily
property disposition programs require the testing of chewable surfaces in a random sample of ten housing units in
properties of 20 units or more. For properties with fewer than 20 units, six units must be tested. These requirements
do not have statistical validity and consequently do not provide the desired degree of assurance. Using the sample
sizes and random sampling procedures in this proposed rule, if no unacceptable hazards are observed in the sample
units tested, then there would be at least 95 percent confidence that no more than 5 percent of all units or 50 units,
whichever is smaller, would have an unacceptable lead-based paint hazard. The table included in &sect;200.820(e)
of the proposed rule was developed to achieve the 95 percent confidence level. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As an example, the table would require that 56 units must be tested in a 600-unit development. If lead (above th e standard
of 1.0 mg/cm
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
2
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
) is not found in any of the 56 tested units, the Department can be 95 percent confident that no more than 30 units (the
lesser of 50 or 5 percent of 600) have lead levels above the standard. As a second example, 236 units (5.9 percent of 4,000)
must be tested in a 4,000-unit development. If all are below the standard, there is 95 percent confidence that no more
than 50 of the 4,000 units (the lesser of 50 or 5 percent of 4000) have lead levels above the standard. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The size of the sample (number of units to be tested) is determined by three factors:

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

N = Total number of units in the project; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
k = Maximum number of leaded units (a unit with one or more components with lead-based paint at or above the standard
of 1.0 mg/cm
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=16 g=5 f=1 -->
2
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=16 g=1 f=1 -->
) that can be tolerated to be missed completely; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
n = Smallest number of units that must be tested to provide 95 percent confidence that the total number of leaded units
is less than ``k'', based on finding no leaded units in the sample tested.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For example, to be 95 percent confident that no more than 5 percent of 300 units have lead, then k=15; if no more than 50
out of 4,000 with lead, then k=50.

In the usual statistical convention, ``n'' is defined as the smallest integer for which the probability of obtaining
no positives in a simple random sample of size ``n'' from a population of size ``N'', of which ``k'' are positive, is
less than 0.05. When ``k'' of ``N'' total are positive, the probability of observing no positives in a simple random
sample of size ``n'' is given by the formula:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The required value of ``n'' is obtained by successively evaluating this expression for n = 1, 2, 3, .&blank;.&blank;.,
until the value of the formula first drops below 0.05. The table in &sect;200.820(e) of the proposed rule was generated
using this method. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Several points need to be made about the revised table. First, for less than 20 units total, all units would have to be
tested to get the desired confidence level. Second, the percentage of units to be tested would decrease with increasing
size of the project. Third, it is apparent from the table that for values of ``N'' above 1,006, 5.9 percent of the units
would need to be tested. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Lower sample sizes may be attractive because of lower testing costs, but that reduces the assurance that units are
not lead-contaminated. The existing procedure does not provide any identifiable level of assurance. Of course,
100 percent assurance can only be achieved by requiring the testing of all the units in a project, at much higher cost.

(b) Subject to the provisions of separate regulations promulgated with respect to any program by the Assistant Secretary
having jurisdiction over that program, the following minimum requirements shall apply to all programs: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) All painted surfaces of HUD-associated housing constructed before 1978 shall be inspected to determine whether
defective paint surfaces exist. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Defective paint surfaces must either: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) Be tested for lead content and, if found to contain lead at concentrations equal to or exceeding levels specified
in paragraph (b)(3) of this section, abated as described in paragraph (b)(4) of this section. Defective paint surfaces
that do not contain lead-based paint do not require treatment; or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) Be abated, if defective paint surfaces are not tested. If not tested, the presence of lead-based paint shall be
assumed. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) If defective paint surfaces are tested, testing shall be accomplished by using a portable X-ray fluorescence
(XRF) analyzer or by laboratory analysis of paint samples, whichever is more cost effective. Abatement as described
in paragraph (b)(4) of this section is required of all defective paint surfaces for which the test results equal or
exceed 1.0 milligram of lead per square centimeter of paint surface. If the laboratory reports the test results in
percent by weight, the standard shall be 0.5 percent or 5000 parts per million (ppm). A qualified inspector or laboratory
shall certify in writing the precise results of the testing. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4)(i) Lead-based paint abatement can create lead dust that is dangerous to workers and occupants, especially small
children. Abatement should be performed only by workers who are trained in managing lead hazards and are properly
protected. Abatement should not be undertaken by home craftsmen, even very skilled ones, or untrained construction
professionals. The generation and control of dust must be carefully considered when selecting the abatement method.
Dust caused by abatement shall be contained within the work area and shall not be allowed to spread to adjacent spaces
or the soil. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) Abatement shall be by covering lead-based paint surfaces, removal of paint, or replacement of painted building
components. Acceptable methods of covering lead-based paint surfaces require the use of durable materials, sealed
and caulked to prevent the escape of lead-contaminated dust. Acceptable methods of paint removal are misted scraping,
scraping with an infrared or coil-type heat gun, and chemical stripping on- or off-site. Unacceptable methods of
abatement include dry unassisted scraping; machine sanding and use of propane or gasoline torches (open flame methods);
and washing and repainting without first thoroughly removing the paint by one of the approved methods.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(iii) Appropriate action shall be taken to protect occupants, especially young children and pregnant women, from
lead hazards associated with abatement. Occupants may not enter spaces undergoing abatement. In most circumstances,
occupants must be temporarily relocated during abatement, in accordance with &sect;35.28. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iv) All abatement procedures must be concluded with a thorough cleaning of all surfaces in the affected dwelling
units and common areas in order to remove lead dust. Cleanup shall be accomplished by vacuuming with a HEPA vacuum and
washing surfaces with a trisodium phosphate detergent, followed by another high efficiency vacuuming. The waste
generated by abatement shall be safely disposed of in accordance with Federal, State, and local laws. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(v) In the case of defective paint spots of one square foot or less, misted scraping and repainting of the defective
spot is considered adequate treatment. However, treatment of defective paint spots shall include proper containment
and cleanup. If the total area of defective paint spots on any one surface exceeds one square foot, or if there are defective
paint spots on more than two surfaces in any one room or space (hallways, pantry, etc.), misted scraping and repainting
of the defective spots is not acceptable treatment. In such circumstances, the entire defective paint surface must
be abated in accordance with paragraph (b)(4)(ii) of this section.

(b) For residential structures constructed prior to 1978, HUD shall cause the property to be inspected for defective
paint surfaces before the closing of the sale of the property. In the case of a sale to a non-owner-occupant purchaser,
treatment may be made a condition of sale, with sufficient sale funds escrowed to assure treatment. Defective paint
surfaces either: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Must be tested for lead content and, if found to contain lead at concentrations equal to or exceeding levels specified
in &sect;35.24(b)(3) of this title, abated as described in &sect;35.24(b) of this title; or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) If not tested, the presence of lead-based paint shall be assumed and the surfaces abated as described in paragraph

 This subsection applies to dwellings constructed before 1978, except as provided in paragraph (d) of this section.
If the purchaser is an owner-occupant and the occupant family contains one or more children less than six years of age,
closing of the sale shall be deferred until completion of the following procedures. Where a blood lead level screening
program is determined by HUD to be reasonably available, screening of each occupant child less than six years of age
will be required. If an EBL condition is identified, HUD will cause the dwelling to be tested for lead-based paint on
chewable surfaces or follow treatment procedures. Testing shall be conducted by a State or local health or housing
agency, an inspector certified or regulated by a State or local health or housing agency, a qualified HUD inspector
or an organization recognized by HUD. Testing shall be performed using an X-ray fluorescence analyzer (XRF) or by
laboratory analysis of paint samples. Test readings of 1 mg/cm2 or higher using an XRF shall be considered positive
for the presence of lead-based paint. If the laboratory reports the results in percent by weight, 0.5 percent or 5000
parts per million shall be considered positive. Where lead-based paint on chewable surfaces is identified, the entire
interior or exterior chewable surface shall be treated. Treatment shall consist of covering or removal of the paint
surface in accordance with &sect;35.24(b)(4) of this title.

In the case of a residential structure constructed before 1978, a random sample of dwelling units shall be tested for
lead-based paint on chewable surfaces as required by paragraph (e) of this section, including a sample of common areas
and exterior chewable surfaces. Common areas included in the sample should include nondwelling facilities commonly
used by children less than six years of age, such as child care centers. All chewable surfaces in selected units shall
be tested. If none of the tested units, common areas or exterior chewable surfaces contain lead-based paint, the project
may be considered free of lead-based paint, and no further testing or abatement action will be required. If lead-based
paint is found in any unit in the sample, all units in the project are required to be tested. If lead-based paint is found
in any common area, all common areas in the project are required to be tested. If lead-based paint is found in any exterior
chewable surface, all exterior chewable surfaces in the project are required to be tested.

For residential structures constructed before 1978, HUD shall cause the property to be inspected for defective paint
surfaces before offering the property for sale. Defective paint surfaces either must be tested for lead content and
abated as described in &sect;35.24(b) of this title, if found to contain lead at concentrations equal to or exceeding
levels specified in &sect;35.24(b)(3) of this title, or, if not tested, the presence of lead-based paint shall be
assumed and the defective paint surfaces abated as described in &sect;35.24(b)(4) of this title. Abatement must
be completed before delivery of the property to the purchaser or, if the disposition program under part 290 of this
title provides for repairs to be performed by the purchaser, such treatment may be included in the required reports.
Residential structures assisted under section 223(f) of the National Housing Act are to be inspected and treated
as set forth in this paragraph.

In the case of a residential structure constructed before 1978, if HUD is presented with test results that indicate
a child less than six years of age living in a unit has an elevated blood lead level or EBL, HUD must either: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) Test or cause to be tested the unit occupied by the child, and, if such test is positive for lead-based paint, abate

(iv) In the case of a structure constructed or substantially rehabilitated before 1978, if the recipient is presented
with test results that indicate that the family purchasing a home under the program includes a child less than six years
of age who has an elevated blood lead level (EBL), the recipient must cause the unit to be tested for lead-based paint
on chewable surfaces. Testing must be conducted by a State or local health or housing agency, by an inspector certified
by a State or local health or housing agency, or by an association recognized by HUD. Lead content shall be tested by
using an X-ray fluorescence analyzer (XRF) or by laboratory analysis of paint samples. Test readings of 1.0 mg/cm2
or higher shall be considered positive for the presence of lead-based paint. If the laboratory reports the results
in percent by weight, the standard shall be 0.5 percent or 5000 parts per million (ppm). Where lead-based paint on chewable
surfaces is identified, covering or removal of the paint surface in accordance with &sect;35.24(b)(4) of this title

on all painted surfaces before initial occupancy. Testing must be conducted by a State or local health or housing agency,
by an inspector certified or regulated by a State or local health or housing agency, or by an organization recognized
by HUD. Lead content must be tested by using an X-ray fluorescence analyzer (XRF) or by laboratory analysis of paint
samples. Test readings of 1 mg/cm2 or higher using an XRF shall be considered positive for the presence of lead-based
paint. If the laboratory reports the test results in percent by weight, 0.5 percent or 5000 parts per million (ppm)
shall be considered positive. Where lead-based paint is identified, the lessee or purchaser must cause all painted
surfaces to be treated. Treatment must consist of covering or removal of the paint surface in accordance with &sect;35.24(b)(4)

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The purpose of this paragraph is to implement the provisions of section 302 of the Lead-Based Paint Poisoning Prevention
Act, 42 U.S.C. 4822, by establishing as far as practicable the hazards due to the presence of paint that might contain
lead and to which children less than six years of age may be exposed in projects assisted under this part. The Secretary
has promulgated requirements at part 35, subpart C of this title, regarding the elimination of lead-based paint hazards
in HUD-associated housing.

(iv) In the case of a structure constructed or substantially rehabilitated before 1978, if the recipient is presented
with test results that indicate that a child less than six years of age occupies the structure and has an elevated blood
lead level (EBL), the recipient must cause the unit to be tested for lead-based paint on chewable surfaces. Testing
must be conducted by a State or local health or housing agency, by an inspector certified or regulated by a State or local
health or housing agency, or by an organization recognized by HUD. Lead content shall be tested by using an X-ray fluorescence
analyzer (XRF) or by laboratory analysis of paint samples. Test readings of 1 mg/cm

(iv) In the case of a structure constructed or substantially rehabilitated prior to 1978, if the Owner is presented
with test results that indicate that a child less than six years of age occupies the structure and has an elevated blood
lead level (EBL), the Owner must cause the unit to be tested for lead-based paint on chewable surfaces. Testing shall
be conducted by a State or local health or housing agency, an inspector certified or regulated by a State or local health
or housing agency, or an organization recognized by HUD. Lead content shall be tested using an X-ray fluorescence
analyzer (XRF) or other method approved by HUD. Test readings of 1 mg/cm2 or higher shall be considered positive for
the presence of lead-based paint. If the laboratory reports the test results in percent by weight, 0.5 percent or 5000
parts per million (ppm) shall be considered positive. When lead-based paint on chewable surfaces is identified,
covering or removal of the paint surface in accordance with &sect;35.24(b)(4) of this title is required. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(v) When abatement will result from rehabilitation activities planned (i.e., when all defective or chewable surfaces
will be replaced, covered, or otherwise abated as described in this part), these surfaces do not have to be tested.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The regulations in 7 CFR part 340, ``Introduction of Organisms and Products Altered or Produced Through Genetic Engineering
Which Are Plant Pests or Which There Is Reason to Believe Are Plant Pests,'' require a person to obtain a permit before
introducing (importing, moving interstate, or releasing into the environment) into the United States certain genetically
engineered organisms and products that are considered ``regulated articles.'' The regulations set forth procedures
for obtaining a permit for the release into the environment of a regulated article, and for obtaining a limited permit
for the importation or interstate movement of a regulated article.

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 In response to a request by one manufacturer/exporter, the Department of Commerce is conducting an administrative
review of the antidumping duty order on industrial nitrocellulose from the United Kingdom. The review covers one
manufacturer/exporter of the subject merchandise to the United States during the period July 1, 1992 through June
30, 1993. The review indicates the existence of dumping margins during the period. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As a result of this review, we have preliminarily determined to assess antidumping duties equal to the differences
between United States price and foreign market value. Interested parties are invited to comment on these preliminary
results.

Background 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
On July 7, 1993, the Department of Commerce (the Department) published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (58 FR 36391) a notice of ``Opportunity to Request an Administrative Review'' of the antidumping duty order on industrial
nitrocellulose (INC) from the United Kingdom. On July 29, 1993, the respondent, Imperial Chemical Industries PLC
(ICI), requested to be reviewed in accordance with section 751(a) of the Tariff Act of 1930, as amended (the Tariff
Act), and &sect;353.22(a) of the Department's regulations (19 CFR 353.22(a)). We published the notice of initiation
of the antidumping duty administrative review on August 24, 1993 (58 FR 44653), covering the period July 1, 1992 through
June 30, 1993. We have now conducted the review in accordance with section 751 of the Tariff Act.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
Scope of the Review 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This review covers shipments of INC from the United Kingdom. INC is a dry, white, amorphous synthetic chemical with
a nitrogen content between 10.8 and 12.2 percent, which is produced from the reaction of cellulose with nitric acid.
It is used as a film-former in coatings, lacquers, furniture finishes, and printing inks. INC is currently classifiable
under Harmonized Tariff Schedule (HTS) item number 3912.20.00. The HTS subheadings are provided for convenience
and U.S. Customs Service purposes. The written description remains dispositive. The scope of the antidumping order
does not include explosive grade nitrocellulose, which has a nitrogen content of greater than 12.2 percent. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This review covers sales by ICI of INC from the United Kingdom entered into the United States during the period July
1, 1992 through June 30, 1993.

Verification 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
We verified the questionnaire responses of ICI's affiliate, Nobel's Explosives Company Ltd. (Nobel's) from February
7, 1994 to February 11, 1994, at Nobel's manufacturing facility in Stevenston, Scotland. We verified the responses
of ICI's U.S. affiliate, ICI Americas Inc. (ICIA) from February 21, 1994 to February 25, 1994 at ICIA's offices in Valley
Forge, Pennsylvania.

United States Price 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Department used purchase price (PP), as defined in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
section 772 of the Tariff Act, in calculating U.S. price (USP) when the merchandise was purchased, or agreed to be purchased,
prior to the date of importation, from the producer of the merchandise through a related sales agent in the United States
by unrelated U.S. purchasers. We determined that PP was the most appropriate determinant of USP for these sales based
on the following factors: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) The merchandise was shipped directly from the manufacturer to the unrelated buyer without being introduced into
the inventory of the respondent's related U.S. selling agent; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) This was the customary commercial channel for sales of this merchandise between the parties involved; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) The respondent's related sales agent acted mainly as a processor of sales-related documentation and communication
links with the unrelated U.S. customer. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Where all the above elements are met, we regard the routine selling functions of the exporter as merely having been
relocated geographically from the country of exportation to the United States, where the sales agent performs them.
Whether these functions take place in the United States or abroad does not change the substance of the functions themselves.

829 F.Supp. 1371, 1378 (CIT 1993). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
We calculated purchase price based on packed delivered prices. We made deductions for ocean freight, marine insurance,
brokerage and handling, and U.S. Customs duties and fees, in accordance with section 772(d)(2) of the Tariff Act.
We adjusted ICI's reported U.S. interest rate to correct a minor error in the interest calculation found at verification.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
We used the best information available (BIA) for marine insurance. At verification we discovered that ICI had failed
to report that it obtains marine insurance from a related company. Further, company officials did not demonstrate
that marine insurance rates were at arm's length. In the absence of a second company involved in either this review
or the less-than-fair-value (LTFV) investigation from which, as BIA, marine insurance rates might be selected,
we calculated a percentage of unit price based on publicly-available data as reported in the administrative review
of INC from Brazil. See Industrial Nitrocellulose from Brazil: Preliminary Results of Antidumping Duty Administrative
Review, (58 FR 27537) May 10, 1993. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
We made an addition to USP for value-added taxes (VAT) in accordance with section 772(d)(1)(C) of the Tariff Act. In
making our adjustment for VAT, we followed the instructions of the United States Court of International Trade (CIT)
in 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

United States, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
834 F.Supp. 1391 (CIT 1993). The Department added to USP the result of multiplying the foreign market tax rate by the
price of the United States merchandise at the same point in the chain of commerce that the foreign market tax was applied
to foreign market sales. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department also adjusted the tax amount calculated for USP and the amount of tax included in foreign market value
(FMV). We deducted the portions of the foreign market tax and the USP tax that are the result of expenses that are included
in the foreign market price used to calculate foreign market tax and in the USP used to calculate the USP tax. Because
these expenses are later deducted to calculate FMV and USP, these adjustments are necessary to prevent our new methodology
for calculating the USP tax from creating dumping margins where no margins would exist if no taxes were levied upon
foreign market sales. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
We disagree with ICI's claim that certain sales, that were sold to a related party and further processed in the United
States before sale to the first unrelated party, were PP sales.

<!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
We used BIA for these exporter's sales price (ESP) sales, because ICI failed to answer the Department's further manufacturing
questionnaire for these sales and to provide prices to the first unrelated purchaser. ICI stated that it was either
impossible or extremely difficult to answer the questionnaire, and, instead, provided a small amount of financial
and manufacturing information for the related company responsible for the ESP sales. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
At verification, we explored with ICI the reasons it provided for not responding to the further manufacturing questionnaire.
We were told that providing the specific further processing information requested by the Department would take an
excessive amount of time. We reviewed documentation that demonstrated that the production of the further processed
product involves a series of steps. At each intermediary step, chemicals and compounds are combined to produce new
compounds that will be mixed with other compounds in the next step. As a result, to determine the amount of INC used in
the final product, and to determine which products use INC, would require a complicated trace back through multiple
intermediary steps. (See Report on Verification of Imperial Chemical Industries PLC and ICI Americas Inc., March
24, 1994, 26&hyph;27.) However, our verification established that ICI had the documentation needed to fulfill the
Department's request for further processing information. ICI's claim appears to be based solely on the time and resources
that would be required to provide the requested information. We, therefore, conclude that it would not have been impossible
for ICI to have answered the further manufacturing questionnaire, and that doing so would have been no less burdensome
for ICI than for respondents in other cases who are asked to answer further manufacturing questionnaires. (See Final
Results of Antidumping Duty Administrative Reviews and Revocation in Part of an Antidumping Duty Order; Antifriction
Bearings (Other Than Tapered Roller Bearings) and Parts Thereof From France, Germany, Italy, Japan, Romania, Singapore,
Sweden, Thailand and the United Kingdom, (59 FR 39729) July 26, 1993.) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Since ICI could have, but did not, provide the data, we have used non-cooperative BIA for these sales. There were no
other firms involved in the LTFV investigation or in this first review. We have therefore used ICI's rate from the final
determination in the LTFV investigation as BIA for these particular sales.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In accordance with section 773(a)(1)(A) of the Tariff Act, we calculated FMV based on home market sales. We did not
include sales to related parties in calculating FMV. Under 19 CFR 353.45, the Department may disregard transactions
between related parties if the price does not fairly reflect the usual price at which sales are made to unrelated parties.
We performed an analysis of related party prices and found that they were not at arm's length. (See Memorandum to the
File, April 15, 1994.) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As in the LTFV investigation, product comparisons were made on the basis of the following criteria: nitrogen percentage,
viscosity rating, wetting agent type, cellulose source, physical form, and wetting agent percentage. (See Final
Determination of Sales at Less Than Fair Value: Industrial Nitrocellulose from the United Kingdom, 55 FR 21055 (May
22, 1990). Where there were no sales of identical merchandise in the home market with which to compare merchandise
sold in the United States, sales of the most similar merchandise were compared on the basis of the characteristics
described above. In those instances, we made adjustments for differences in the physical characteristics of the
merchandise in accordance with section 773(a)(4)(C) of the Tariff Act. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
We calculated FMV based on packed and either delivered or ex-works prices to unrelated customers in the United Kingdom.
We made deductions for home market packing, inland freight, and rebates, and added U.S. packing costs in accordance
with section 773(a)(1) of the Tariff Act. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
When a commission was paid on a PP sale but not on the home market sale, we added the amount of the commission to the FMV
and then deducted from FMV the lesser of either total home market indirect selling expenses or the U.S. commission
amount, in accordance with 19 CFR 353.56(b)(1).

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As a result of verification, we adjusted home market indirect selling expenses, packing, and credit costs which had
been incorrectly or inappropriately quantified. Although we were able to verify ICI's home market packing expenses
for the period December 1, 1992&hyph;June 30, 1993, we were unable to verify ICI's claimed home market packing costs
for the July 1, 1992&hyph;November 30, 1992 portion of the period of review (POR). (See Report on Verification of Imperial
Chemical Industries PLC and ICI Americas Inc., March 24, 1994, 9&hyph;12, and Memorandum from Case Analyst to the
File, April 15, 1994.) We used BIA for all home market packing expenses for sales made between July 1, 1992 and November
30, 1992. Because respondents claimed that drums were reused once during this five-month period, as BIA we have used
the verified packing costs for the latter part of the POR (adjusted as described below) and divided that amount by two,
to account for the reuse of packing drums during the first half of the POR. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
During the verification of ICI, the Department discovered that the costs of at least some of the drums purchased in
May 1993 were overstated. A number of purchases of steel drums were made during that month. At one point during the month,
the price of the drums increased. Rather than determining an average price, ICI selected the higher price as representative
for the entire month of May. From the information provided at verification, we could not determine how many drums were
purchased at the lower price and how many were purchased at the higher price. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Therefore, as BIA for all May 1993 home market sales, we have used the lower price for packing cost. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In comparing home market sales to PP sales, we made a circumstance-of-sale adjustment for differences in credit terms
by deducting home market credit expenses and adding U.S. credit expenses, in accordance with 19 CFR 353.56(a)(2).
We have used BIA for the home market interest rate for the purposes of calculating credit and inventory carrying expenses.
ICI does not incur short-term credit costs associated with INC in either the U.S. or the home market. ICI was unable
to satisfactorily support at verification its reported claim of what its home market credit costs would have been
if short-term debt had existed during the POR. In the U.S. market, ICI established that, if short-term debt existed,
it would have been financed using a particular United Kingdom-based interest rate. For the purposes of calculating
home market credit and inventory carrying costs, we have therefore used the same United Kingdom-based interest rate
as used for U.S. credit.

Comment 1:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Petitioner argues that all Coast Rican flower producers and exporters covered by the agreement have not established
non-use of countervailable programs for a period of at least five years. Since the first administrative review, nine
companies have signed on to the agreement. Petitioner notes that &sect;355.25(a)(2)(i) of the Department's regulations
states that a suspended investigation may be terminated if ``[a]ll producers and exporters covered at the time of
revocation by the order or suspension agreement have not applied for or received any net subsidy on the merchandise
for a period of at least five consecutive years.'' As not all current signatories were covered by the first review,
petitioner argues that they have not been found to comply with the terms of the agreement for five consecutive years.
Petitioner contends that it is not Department practice to deviate from its regulations without a demonstration that
the unusual facts or circumstances of a particular case require special consideration. Petitioner points out that
in Ceramic Tile from Mexico; Final Results of Countervailing Duty Administrative Review and Revocation in Part of
the Countervailing Duty Order (59 FR 2823, 2824, January 19, 1994) (``Tile from Mexico'') the Department found that
a company had fulfilled the five-year requirement, even though it had not been reviewed during one review period because
it did not ship during that period. The Department based this determination on the ``unusual facts and circumstances''
of the case and the lack of a clearly articulated Department policy detailing the requirements of 19 CFR 355.25(a)(3).
The Department did revoke the order for this company. Petitioner also notes a Department decision to require that
separate administrative reviews be conducted for each of the review periods. (See Lamb Meat from New Zealand; Final
Results of Countervailing Duty Administrative Review (58 FR 45,097, August 26, 1993), and the Department's Memorandum
in that review Re: Basis for Revocation of Orders and Terminations of Suspension Agreements Under 19 CFR 355.25(a)(1)
at 4 (12/14/92) (on file in room B&hyph;099, Department of Commerce, Washington, DC).

Respondents argue that the changes to the list of signatories demonstrate the effectiveness and inclusiveness of
compliance measures established by respondents to assure fulfillment of their obligations under the agreement.
Respondents contend that requiring all those who happen to appear on the list of signatories as of the period of review
to demonstrate their compliance with the terms of the agreement for a period of five consecutive years imposes an impossible
standard, especially in the case where a company was newly established during the five-year review period. Furthermore,
respondents state that the 15 original signatories have accounted for at least 85 percent of Costa Rican exports of
subject merchandise to the United States throughout the life of the agreement. Respondents argue that the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Tile from Mexico
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 case, referred to by petitioner, dealt with partial revocation of a countervailing duty order and is therefore irrelevant
to the current case. Respondents contend that the language of &sect;355.25(a)(2), ``at the time of revocation,''
refers to the current period of review upon which the determination to terminate is based. Respondents argue that
following petitioner's interpretation would involve the parties in an endless cycle of ongoing review that the termination
provisions are intended to avoid.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Department's Position:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 We disagree with petitioner. We recognize that &sect;355.25(a)(2)(i) appears to require that, in order for the Department
to terminate a suspended investigation, ``[a]ll producers or exporters covered at the time of revocation'' must
not have ``applied for or received any net subsidy on the merchandise for a period of at least five consecutive years.''
As explained below, however, the Department has determined that the strict reading advocated by the petitioner is
not required by either the statute or the Department's regulations, and would not be in accordance with the terms of
the agreement suspending the investigation in the present proceeding.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Specifically, section 704(b) of the Tariff Act provides that the Department may suspend a countervailing duty investigation
``if the government of the country in which the subsidy practice is alleged to occur agrees, or exporters who account
for 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
substantially all of the imports
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
'' of the subject merchandise agree, ``to eliminate the subsidy completely or to offset completely the amount of the
net subsidy'' within the appropriate period of time. 19 U.S.C. 1671c(b) (emphasis added). The statutory language
has not been changed since 1987, when the suspension agreement in this case was entered into. By regulation, the Department
has defined ``substantially all'' of the merchandise in this context as meaning ``exporters that have accounted
for not less than 85 percent by value or volume of the merchandise during the period for which the Department is measuring
benefits in the investigation or such other period that the [Department] considers representative.'' 9 CFR 355.18(c).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The regulations only require the addition of new exporters in the event that the existing signatory exporters no longer
account for substantially all of the merchandise. 19 CFR 355.19(c). Consequently, for purposes of terminating a
suspended investigation under 355.25(a)(2)(i), all that is required is that the same exporters who have accounted
for 85 percent of the merchandise for a period of five consecutive years have not applied for or received any net subsidy
on the merchandise during that period.

<!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Although not required by the statute, the Department may require new or additional producers or exporters to become
signatories to an agreement, thus raising the coverage above the 85 percent level, in order to permit more effective
monitoring of the agreement. In this case, pursuant to the agreement, the GOCR was required to notify the Department
whenever new producers or exporters exported subject merchandise to the United States, and whether those producers
or exporters had agreed to comply with the terms of the agreement. Agreement, 52 FR at 1361. To ensure that it met this
requirement, the GOCR required any new or different producer or exporter which exported a certain volume or value
of the subject merchandise to the United States to become a signatory. These new signatories were required to comply
with the terms of the agreement during each year they were covered. The new signatories which have been reviewed by
the Department provided a further track record of compliance with the suspension agreement. This provided the Department
with evidence above and beyond that required under the statute and the Department's regulations for both coverage
and termination.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Finally, we agree with respondents that the Tile from Mexico case dealt with partial revocation, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
i.e.,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 a company-specific revocation, of a countervailing duty order under &sect;355.25(a)(3) of the Department's regulations.
The regulations contain no similar provision permitting partial termination of a suspension agreement. Therefore,
the Tile from Mexico determination does not bear on the outcome of this proceeding.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Accordingly, we have determined that section 355.25(a)(2) permits termination of a suspended investigation whenever
the Department determines that the exporters or producers that originally signed the suspension agreement have
consistently accounted for at least 85 percent of the imports of the subject merchandise for a period of at least five
consecutive years, during which time they did not apply for or receive any net subsidy on the subject merchandise.
In addition, any new signatories must be found to have complied with the terms of the agreement during the time they
are covered.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department has determined that throughout the life of the present agreement, including during the current review,
the producers and exporters that originally signed the agreement have continued to account for at least 85 percent
of the imports, despite the fact that new producers or exporters were added to the agreement. See Memo to the File, dated
March 30, 1994, public version on file in room B&hyph;099, Department of Commerce, Washington, DC. In addition, we
have determined that no producer or exporter covered by the agreement has applied for or received any net subsidy on
the subject merchandise during this review or during any of the previous four reviews. Hence, for a period of at least
five consecutive years after entry into the agreement, the Department has determined that the producers and exporters
that signed the agreement and that consistently have accounted for substantially all of the imports of the subject
merchandise into the United States have not applied for or received any net subsidy on the subject merchandise. Also,
the signatories that were later added to the agreement have complied with the terms of the agreement during each review
period in which they were covered. Therefore, we determine that the requirements for termination under &sect;355.25(a)(2)(i)
have been met. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Comment 2:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Petitioner argues that the Department should decline to terminate the suspended investigation because all the programs
are still in existence and used by the flower producers and exporters for non-subject merchandise. Petitioner asserts
that after termination, the former signatories will continue to be eligible to receive benefits for most of the programs,
absent active ACOFLOR intervention and monitoring. Moreover, petitioner contends that termination would be inappropriate
without updated information covering the 1992 and 1993 review periods.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Petitioner argues that it is not unlikely that the flower producers and exporters will use the six programs covered
by the agreement. Specifically, petitioner makes the following arguments regarding the six programs:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Exporter Credit for Sales Tax on Certain Domestic Purchases: Petitioner argues that there will be no incentive
for ACOFLOR or the GOCR to continue monitoring receipt of benefits under this program. Petitioner also asserts that
there will be incentives for flower producers and exporters to switch equipment used for the production on non-subject
merchandise, for which exemptions are allowed, to the production of subject merchandise, for which exemptions are
monitored under the agreement.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Exporter Exemptions for Taxes and Duties on Imports: Petitioner makes the same arguments as stated above for the
Exporter Credit for Sales Tax on Certain Domestic Purchases.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Accelerated Depreciation: Petitioner argues that, although the Department has found that no signatories have
used accelerated depreciation, there is no formal or informal mechanism to stop flower producers and exporters from
claiming accelerated depreciation on their tax forms.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) Certificates for Increasing Exports (CIEX): Petitioner argues that the CIEX program has not been terminated
because some Costa Rican exporters received CIEX benefits in 1991 through a special commission established in 1984
to pay benefits accrued in earlier years. Additionally, petitioner contends that there are no formal or informal
measures to render exports of the subject merchandise ineligible for the benefit.

<!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(5) Tax Credit Certificates (Certificados Abono Tributario CATs)): Petitioner contends that it is not clear that
the CAT program was terminated as it continues to undergo fundamental changes. Petitioner also urges that although
the Central Bank is not granting CATs in new export contracts, it is unclear whether the same or different benefits
could be granted without using export contracts which are currently required to obtain CAT benefits.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(6) Income Tax Exemption for Export Earnings: The agreement requires exporters to maintain separate accounting
records for subject and non-subject merchandise. Petitioner argues that as only one company, American Flower, maintains
separate records of duty and tax exemption benefits received for exports of non-subject merchandise, the Department
cannot confirm whether flower producers and exporters have received countervailable benefits on exports of subject
merchandise. Petitioner contends that flower producers and exporters were eligible to apply for the income tax exemption
if they had tax-exempt export profits and if they segregated domestic and export sales income in calculating income
tax. Consequently, petitioner asserts, it is unlikely that new flower producers and exporters not previously subject
to the agreement will maintain separate records for the subject merchandise.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Respondents argue that the GOCR and ACOFLOR have pledged to maintain controls to monitor receipt of benefits and that
the GOCR is committed to eliminating incentives that distort trade. Respondents argue that it is unlikely that the
flower producers and exporters will use the following six programs after termination:

(1) Exporter Credit for Sales Tax on Certain Domestic Purchases: Respondents argue that, in most cases, it will not
always be feasible for flower producers and exporters to switch equipment from the production of a product which is
non-subject merchandise to subject merchandise product.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Exporter Exemptions for Taxes and Duties on Imports: Respondents made the same arguments as above for the Exporter
Credit for Sales Tax on Certain Domestic Purchases.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Accelerated Depreciation: Respondents assert that there are two separate government agencies, Ministry of
Finance and CENPRO, which have established government controls to block access to the use of accelerated depreciation.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) CIEX: Respondents argue that this program was terminated in 1988. Respondents argue that even if some of the funds
authorized for this program in 1988 were not actually distributed until 1991, the GOCR made no CIEX distributions
to flower producers and exporters. The respondents also argue that the fact that such funds may have actually been
distributed in 1991 does not alter that fact that the CIEX program was effectively terminated in 1984 for lack of funding
and officially closed in 1988.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5) CATs: Respondents argue that the only verified fundamental changes to the CAT program are those reducing or restricting
its benefits.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(6) Income Tax Exemption for Export Earnings: Respondents contend that with the continuation of GOCR controls, the
GOCR will not grant exemptions unless the claimant can demonstrate that the income for which an exemption is sought
is not derived from exports of the subject merchandise. Respondents also note that this program is being phased out.

Department's Position:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Section 355.25(a)(2) of the Department's regulations provides that the Department may terminate a suspension agreement
despite the fact that the subsidy programs have not been abolished, provided the Department concludes that the requirements
of this provision are met. As explained in Comment 1, the Department determines that the original signatories have
complied with the terms of the agreement and the requirements of &sect;355.25(a)(2)(i). Regarding &sect;355.25(a)(2)(ii),
ACOFLOR has certified that the signatories are not likely to apply for or receive any countervailable subsidies in
the future. The GOCR and ACOFLOR have certified that the control mechanisms to ensure compliance with the agreement
will remain in place if the agreement is terminated. Furthermore, government officials stated during verification
that Costa Rican subsidies in general were being phased out. In sum, as the Department determined in the preliminary
results of review, the record contains no evidence indicating that the signatories will apply for or receive any net
subsidy on the subject merchandise in the future. 59 FR at 6238. Petitioner has offered no arguments which would reasonably
contradict this determination.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition, we disagree with each of the petitioner's program-specific arguments for the following reasons:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Exporter Credit for Sales Tax on Certain Domestic Purchases and (2) Exporter Exemptions for Taxes and Duties on
Imports: The GOCR and ACOFLOR have certified that the control mechanisms currently in place to monitor compliance
with the agreement will remain in place so that equipment on which duties or taxes were exempted will not be switched
to the production of subject merchandise after termination.

<!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(3) Accelerated Depreciation: We agree with respondents that there are formal mechanisms in place at the Ministry
of Finance and CENPRO to prevent flower producers and exporters from claiming accelerated depreciation. At verification,
we found that the signatories have not used the accelerated depreciation program.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) CIEX: We agree with respondents that this program was terminated in 1988 and that no flower producers or exporters
have received benefits from this program during the five years required for termination.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5) CAT: We agree with respondents that all changes during the period of review to this program have reduced and/or
restricted the receipt of benefits.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(6) Income Tax Exemption for Export Earnings: The agreement requires signatories to maintain separate accounting
records of exports to receive income tax exemptions for export earnings. Contrary to the argument of petitioner,
the Department has verified that the signatories maintained these records. A company must maintain separate accounting
records in order to receive an exemption from duties on non-physically incorporated inputs. Only one company, American
Flower, maintained these separate accounting records for the exemption from duties on non-physically incorporated
inputs, and only American Flower received this exemption on duties. All companies maintained separate records of
imports eligible for tax and duty exemptions and domestic purchases eligible for tax credits on inputs physically
incorporated into exports of the subject merchandise.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Further, under &sect;355.25(b)(2) of the Department's regulations, the government of the affected country may
request termination of a suspension agreement during the fifth and subsequent annual anniversary months of the suspension
of the investigation. In the current proceedings, the fifth anniversary month was January 1992 and the review period
for termination is January 1, 1991 through December 31, 1991. Therefore, contrary to petitioner's argument, the
fifth anniversary month, January 1992, and the 1991 review period is the ``time of revocation'' within the meaning
of &sect;355.25(a)(2), and the Department may terminate the agreement without information regarding the 1992 and
1993 review periods.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Based upon the foregoing, in accordance with section &sect;355.25(a)(2)(ii) of the Department's regulations,
we determine that it is not likely that the producers or exporters will in the future apply for or receive a net subsidy
on the subject merchandise.

Comment 3:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Petitioner argues that the ability to export to the U.S. market is essential for Costa Rican flower producers and exporters
to remain viable. Petitioner asserts that because Costa Rican flower producers and exporters must compete with hundreds
of Colombian flower producers who dominate the U.S. market, the Costa Rican flower producers and exporters continue
to have a need for flower subsidies.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Respondents counter that throughout the life of the agreement, Costa Rican flower producers and exporters of the
subject merchandise have been able to compete in the U.S. market without receiving subsidies. They also argue that
the GOCR is committed to eliminating incentives that distort trade because they are no longer needed to maintain competitiveness,
and because they cost too much.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Department's Position:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 We disagree with petitioner. As stated in Comment 1, the original signatories still accounted for substantially
all of the exports of the subject merchandise to the United States in 1991, the period of review. The Department has
determined that the original signatories have not received subsidies on exports of the subject merchandise to the
United States during at least five consecutive years. Hence, there is no evidence that Costa Rican flower producers
and exporters continue to need subsidies to compete.

Final Results of Review
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
After considering all of the comments received, we determine that the signatories have complied with the terms of
the agreement for the period January 1, 1991 through December 31, 1991. In addition, we determine that the signatories
have met the requirements for termination of the agreement. The original signatories have not applied for or received
any net subsidy on the subject merchandise for five consecutive years and they have filed the certifications required
by 19 CFR &sect;355.25(b)(2). Based on the foregoing, we determine that there is no likelihood that the signatories
will apply for or receive any net subsidy in the future. Therefore, we determine to terminate the Suspension of the
Countervailing Duty Investigation on Fresh Cut Flowers from Costa Rica. As a result, we will also terminate the reviews
in progress for the agreement covering the 1992 and 1993 periods.

 The instrument will be used for studies of variations in the abundance of the stable isotopes of carbon, nitrogen and
oxygen that occur in association with biological and physical transformations. These measurements will be used
to understand the mechanisms of isotope fractionation in biological processes, particularly photosynthesis and
respiration. In addition, the instrument will be used in studies of the natural variation of isotope ratio and relative
abundance gases in the atmosphere and dissolved in the ocean. Taken together these studies will address scientific
questions concerning the operation of the biosphere and the interaction of these with the atmosphere and oceans.

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 BPA proposes to upgrade the existing operational telecommunications equipment throughout their service area (within
the states of Oregon, Washington, Idaho, and Montana). This upgrade will involve replacing existing analog radios
with digital radios and fiber optic equipment. Fiber optic cable will be strung on existing structures or a new parallel
line within BPA's existing transmission line rights-of-way. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A site specific project has been identified for the first segment of this proposed telecommunication upgrade. It
includes installing fiber optic cable and related equipment from BPA's Ross Substation near Vancouver, Washington,
to Franklin Substation near Pasco, Washington. This distance is approximately 340 kilometers (217 miles). Most
of the cable will be installed on existing structures, however, in certain areas additional poles will be needed to
carry the cable when existing towers cannot carry the additional load. The line will span both floodplains and wetlands
located in the counties of Clark, Skamania, Klickitat, Benton, and Franklin in Washington; and Sherman, Gilliam,
Morrow, Wasco, and Umatilla counties in Oregon. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In accordance with DOE regulations for compliance with floodplain and wetlands environmental review requirements
(10 CFR part 1022), BPA will prepare a floodplain and wetlands assessment and will perform this proposed action in
a manner so as to avoid or minimize potential harm to or within the affected floodplain and wetlands. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The floodplains and wetlands assessment will be included in the environmental assessment (EA) being prepared for
the proposed project in accordance with the requirements of the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA). A floodplain
statement of findings will be included in any finding of no significant impact that may be issued following the completion
of the environmental assessment.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 This EA covers two different levels of environmental analysis: One is the programmatic approach that would describe
future telecommunication upgrades throughout BPA's service area and the other is a site specific analysis covering
the first segment of a proposed upgrade from BPA's Ross Substation near Vancouver, Washington, to Franklin Substation
located near Pasco, Washington. The programmatic EA would cover a discussion of the affected environment and a general
overview of potential impacts and possible mitigation. For each segment of BPA's system proposed for telecommunication
upgrading, a site-specific analysis would be completed within a separate NEPA process. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The site specific portion of the EA will involve crossing the 100-year floodplain of several major rivers and tributaries.
At major river crossings, the fiber optic cable would be placed on existing structures so no new towers would be located
in floodplains. The smaller rivers and tributaries would be spanned using either existing towers or new poles. The
poles would not be located within a floodplain. Potential impacts to floodplains could occur due to clearing of riparian
vegetation and improvement of access roads. However, with mitigation, impacts would be eliminated or minimized
to the fullest extent possible. The first segment of this proposed upgrade, from Ross Substation to Franklin Substation,
will cross 100-year floodplains associated with the following rivers/creeks (moving west to east): Burnt Bridge
Creek, Lacamas Creek, Matney Creek, Little Washougal River, Washougal River, Rock Creek, Wind River, Little White
Salmon River, White Salmon River, Klickitat River, Fivemile Creek, Columbia River (crossed three times), Fifteenmile
Creek, Deschutes River, Fulton Canyon Creek, Spanish Hollow Creek, John Day River, Quinton Canyon Creek, Jones Canyon
Creek, China Creek, Willow Creek, Sixmile Creek, Umatilla River. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Permanently-flooded wetlands and small seasonal and riparian wetlands occur in the 100-year floodplains of some
of the rivers and creeks mentioned above. Several of the larger wetlands occur in sections 3, 9, 10, 16, &amp; 17 in Township
2 North, Range 7 East, in section 31 in Township 5 North, Range 27 East, and in section 15, Township 4 North and Range 25
East. The greatest potential to affect wetlands comes from the installation of new parallel structures or access
road improvements. Affects to wetlands could include filling wetlands, alteration of plant communities, alteration
of the hydrology, or water quality degradation. These effects can be minimized or eliminated by avoiding disturbance
to wetlands through careful planning and construction methods. For more specific information on floodplains and
wetlands in the project area contact Ms. Kevin Ward, Environmental Coordinator_EFBG, Bonneville Power Administration,
P.O. Box 3621, Portland, Oregon 97208&hyph;3621, (503) 230&hyph;5511.

The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) has received an application for a new license for the Clyde River
hydropower project, FERC No. 2306. The hydropower project is located on the Clyde River in Vermont.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FERC staff has determined that licensing this project would constitute a major federal action significantly
affecting the quality of the human environment. Therefore, the staff intends to prepare an environmental impact
statement (EIS) on the hydroelectric project in accordance with the National Environmental Policy Act.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The staff's EIS will objectively consider both site specific and cumulative environmental impacts of the project
and reasonable alternatives, and will include an economic, financial and engineering analysis.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A draft EIS will be issued and circulated for review by all the interested parties. All comments filed on the draft EIS
will be analyzed by the staff and considered in a final EIS. The staff's conclusions and recommendations will then
be presented for the consideration of the Commission in reaching its final licensing decision.

The FERC staff prepared a scoping document (Scoping Document 1) and held a scoping meeting on March 9, 1994, in Newport,
Vermont, to assist the staff in identifying the scope of environmental issues that should be analyzed. The results
of scoping indicated that an EIS should be prepared for this project rather than an Environmental Assessment as staff
had initially anticipated.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

Description of Project:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The proposed project would consist of: (1) An existing 22-foot-high, 130-foot-long concrete and timber crib dam;
(2) a reservoir having a surface area of 40 acres at normal water surface elevation 717 feet NGVD; (3) a gated intake
structure having a trash rack; (4) a short 14-foot-diameter penstock; (5) a new powerhouse containing a 1,000-Kw
generating unit operated at a 20-foot net head; (6) a tailrace; (7) a transformer; and (8) appurtenant facilities.
Applicant estimates that the average annual generation would be 4.000 Kwh and that the cost of the studies under the
permit would be $125,000. Power produced from the project would be sold to one or more electric utilities located in
Massachusetts. The dam is owned by the applicant.

Take notice that on April 25, 1994, Transwestern Pipeline Company (Transwestern) filed revised procedures under
Order Nos. 497

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

<FOOTCITE>1</FOOTCITE>
 Transwestern's filing is in response to Order No. 497&hyph;F which, among other things, required Transwestern to
show cause why it should not be required to remove the operating employee restrictions from its Standards E and F, 18
CFR 161.3 (e) and (f) (1993).
<FOOTCITE>2</FOOTCITE>
 Transwestern filed, under protest, revised standards of conduct procedures that remove the reference to ``operating''
from its Standards E and F. Transwestern's filing also reflects that although it occupies office space in the same
building as its marketing affiliate, Transwestern personnel are no longer located on the same floor.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 Section 5(h)(1) of TSCA authorizes EPA to exempt persons from premanufacture notification (PMN) requirements and
permit them to manufacture or import new chemical substances for test marketing purposes if the Agency finds that
the manufacture, processing, distribution in commerce, use, and disposal of the substances for test marketing purposes
will not present an unreasonable risk of injury to human health or the environment. EPA may impose restrictions on
test marketing activities and may modify or revoke a test marketing exemption upon receipt of new information which
casts significant doubt on its finding that the test marketing activity will not present an unreasonable risk of injury.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
EPA hereby approves TME&hyph;94&hyph;11. EPA has determined that test marketing of the new chemical substance described
below, under the conditions set out in the TME application, and for the time period and restrictions specified below,
will not present an unreasonable risk of injury to human health or the environment. Production volume, use, and the
number of customers must not exceed that specified in the application. All other conditions and restrictions described
in the application and in this notice must be met. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Inadvertently the notice of receipt of the application was not published. Therefore, an opportunity to submit comments
is being offered at this time. The complete nonconfidential document is available in the TSCA Nonconfidential Information
Center (NCIC), Rm. NEB&hyph;607 at the above address between 12 noon and 4 p.m., Monday through Friday, excluding
legal holidays. EPA may modify or revoke the test marketing exemption if comments are received which cast significant
doubt on its finding that the test marketing activities will not present an unreasonable risk of injury.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The following additional restrictions apply to TME&hyph;94&hyph;11. A bill of lading accompanying each shipment
must state that the use of the substance is restricted to that approved in the TME. In addition, the applicant shall
maintain the following records until 5 years after the date they are created, and shall make them available for inspection
or copying in accordance with section 11 of TSCA:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1.&blank; Records of the quantity of the TME substance produced and the date of manufacture.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2.&blank; Records of dates of the shipments to each customer and the quantities supplied in each shipment.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3.&blank; Copies of the bill of lading that accompanies each shipment of the TME substance.

The company listed in this notice has filed an application under  225.23(a)(1) of the Board's Regulation Y (12 CFR 225.23(a)(1))
for the Board's approval under section 4(c)(8) of the Bank Holding Company Act (12 U.S.C. 1843(c)(8)) and  225.21(a)

Interested persons may express their views in writing on the question whether consummation of the proposal can ``reasonably
be expected to produce benefits to the public, such as greater convenience, increased competition, or gains in efficiency,
that outweigh possible adverse effects, such as undue concentration of resources, decreased or unfair competition,
conflicts of interests, or unsound banking practices.'' Any request for a hearing on this question must be accompanied
by a statement of the reasons a written presentation would not suffice in lieu of a hearing, identifying specifically
any questions of fact that are in dispute, summarizing the evidence that would be presented at a hearing, and indicating
how the party commenting would be aggrieved by approval of the proposal.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Under the provisions of the Federal Paperwork Reduction Act of 1981 (44 U.S.C. chapter 35), the Administration for
Children and Families (ACF) is requesting clearance for instruments to implement Executive Order 12862 within the
Administration for children and Families (ACF). The purpose of the data collection is to obtain customer satisfaction
information from those entities who are funded to be our partners in the delivery of services to the American public.
ACF partners are those entities that receive funding to deliver services or assistance from ACF programs. Examples
of partners are States and local governments, the territories, service providers, Indian Tribes and tribal organizations,
grantees, researchers, or other intermediaries serving target populations identified by and funded directly or
indirectly by ACF. The surveys will obtain information about how well ACF is meeting the needs of our partners in operating
the ACF programs.

New Request.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Description: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Executive Order 12862 directs agencies that provide significant services directly to the public to survey customers
to determine the kind and quality of services they want and their level of satisfaction with existing services. This
request is for the generic clearance for the Administration for Children and Families to implement Executive Order
12864 within the agency in relation to the satisfaction of those entities who are funded to be our partners in the delivery
of services to the American public. ACF's partners are those entities that receive services or assistance directly
from ACF programs such as State and local governments, the territories, the District of Columbia, Indian Tribes and
tribal organizations, grantees, service providers, researchers, and significant other intermediaries serving
target populations identified by and funded directly or indirectly by ACF.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ACF will conduct voluntary confidential surveys of our partners to identify strengths and weakness in the administrative
management of ACF programs and to determine how we can better serve our partners so together we can better serve the
American public.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The generic surveys of our partners will provide descriptive and statistical information on ACF programs across
at-least twelve (12) major domains: Welfare, child support enforcement, vulnerable youth, day care, employment
training, Head Start, emergency assistance, family violence, foster care, adoption assistance, services to special
populations, and refugee resettlement. For each domain, ACF intends to use information provided by out partners
to determine the kind and quality of services they want and expect, their level of satisfaction with existing services
an to implement improvements where feasible and practical.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The voluntary partnership surveys will focus only on issues of direct concern to our partners regarding their relationship
and opinions on the level of efficiency and quality of services provided by ACF. These concerns may include: Partnership
arrangements in policy formulation and implantation of program strategies, considerations of Federal, State and
local administrative management practices in policy formulation, appropriateness and timeliness of decisionsmaking,
timeliness of funding allocations and grant awards, utility of information collection, efficacy of information
sharing, the elimination of inoperable internal rules and guidelines, courtesy and cooperation of federal staffs
with out partners, assessing the effectiveness of technical assistance provided and the need for additional technical
assistance, adequacy of problem resolutions, multi-cultural sensitivity in the decision-making process, and
the attainment of goals and outcomes that can be used to measure the efficiency and cost effectiveness of ACF programs
in meeting the needs of children, youth and families at the ACF level.

The above figures are based on an estimate of approximately one (1) hour per response to respond and submit the information.
The 51 respondents include the 50 States and the District of Columbia. The figure in the annual burden hours column
takes into account State supervised, county administered (State supervised), and State administered programs
where the county must submit data to the State prior to its aggregation and submission to the Administration for Children
and Families.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
We propose to select approximately 10 States per year. The ten (10) States will represent both large and small States
and county and State administered units.

Description:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The data collection instrument will be used by the Children's Bureau within the Administration for Children, Youth
and Families (ACYF) of the Administration for Children and Families (ACF) to conduct the National Study of Protective,
Preventive and Reunification of Services to Children and their Families.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The purposes of the study are to: (1) Determine the number and percentage of children and families receiving protective,
preventive, reunification/out-of-home services, and after-care services; and (2) obtain national data on the
number, types, and dynamics of the services provided to children and their families.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The findings of the study will provide a basis upon which child welfare policy can be developed and refined throughout
the next decade. Other benefits derived from the pilot study will provide standardized services definitions for
protective, preventive, reunification services and for the target populations eligible to receive them. The study
will identify services provided by child welfare agencies across the country and develop standardized service definitions
across agencies.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Agency for Health Care Policy and Research (AHCPR) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
announces a public meeting to receive comments and information pertaining to the update of the clinical practice
guideline Cataract in Adults: Management of Functional Impairment (AHCPR Publication No. 93&hyph;0542). The AHCPR-supported
guideline was developed by a private sector panel of health care experts and consumers, and released in February,
1993. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On August 9, 1993, AHCPR announced that it was inviting the nominations of qualified individuals to serve on a panel
as the co-chairpersons and as panel members to update a clinical practice guideline on Cataract in Adults: Management
of Functional Impairment. The update panel's tasks will be to assess new research in selected areas previously reviewed,
review current literature on new treatments, and assess new research published on the management of functional impairment
due to cataract in adults. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A public meeting to address the update and timing of the update of the guideline, Cataract in Adults: Management of
Functional Impairment, and to provide an opportunity for interested parties to contribute relevant information
and comments, including research in areas relevant to the guideline that was not available at the time the guideline
was written, will be held as follows:

Background 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1989 (Pub. L. 101&hyph;239) added a new title IX to the Public Health Service
Act (the Act), which established the Agency for Health Care Policy and Research (AHCPR) to enhance the quality, appropriateness,
and effectiveness of health care services, and access to such services. (See 42 U.S.C. 299&hyph;299c&hyph;6 and
1320b&hyph;12.) The Agency for Health Care Policy and Research Reauthorization Act of 1992 (Pub. L. 102&hyph;410),
enacted on October 13, 1992, extended the authorization of AHCPR and amended certain provisions related to the development
of clinical practice guidelines. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In keeping with its legislative mandate, AHCPR is arranging for the development, periodic review, and update of clinically
relevant guidelines that may be used by physicians, nurses, other health care providers, educators, and consumers
to assist in determining how diseases, disorders, and other health care conditions can most effectively and appropriately
be prevented, diagnosed, treated, and clinically managed. Based on the guidelines produced, AHCPR oversees development,
periodic review, and update of medical review criteria, standards of quality, and performance measures. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 912 of the Act (42 U.S.C. 299b&hyph;1(b)), as amended by Public Law 102&hyph;410, requires that the guidelines:

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. Be based on the best available research and professional 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
judgment; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. Be presented in formats appropriate for use by physicians, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
nurses, other health care providers, medical educators, medical review organizations, and consumers; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. Be presented in treatment-specific or condition-specific forms appropriate for use in clinical practice, educational
programs, and reviewing quality and appropriateness of medical care;

4. Include information on the risks and benefits of alternative 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
strategies for prevention, diagnosis, treatment, and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
management of the particular health condition(s); and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
5. Include information on the costs of alternative strategies

for prevention, diagnosis, treatment, and management of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the particular health condition(s), where cost information 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
is available and reliable. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 914 of the Act (42 U.S.C. 299b&hyph;3(a)), as amended by Public Law 102&hyph;410, identifies factors to be
considered in establishing priorities for guidelines, including the extent to which the guidelines would:

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 FDA is announcing its intention to accept and consider a single source application from IIT for a cooperative agreement
to support NCFST. FDA's authority to enter into grants and cooperative agreements is set out in section 301 of the Public
Health Service Act (42 U.S.C. 241). FDA's research program is described in the Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance
No. 93.103. Before entering into cooperative agreements, FDA carefully considers the benefits that such agreements
will provide to the public. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
IIT's application will undergo dual peer review. An external review committee of experts in food science research
will review and evaluate the application based on its scientific merit. A second level review will be conducted by
the National Advisory Environmental Health Science Council.

I. Background
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 of May 3, 1988 (53 FR 15736), FDA published a request for applications for a cooperative agreement to establish a National
Center for Food Safety which joins the resources of government, academia, and industry in a consortium to study questions
of food safety. FDA awarded the cooperative agreement to IIT in September, 1988. Applications received were competitively
reviewed by a panel of non-FDA food scientists, and the award was approved by the National Advisory Environmental
Health Science Council in September, 1988.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

 In the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 of September 10, 1991 (56 FR 46189), FDA published a notice of its intention to limit consideration for the award of
a cooperative agreement to IIT to support NCFST. FDA awarded the cooperative agreement to IIT on September 30, 1991,
following competitive review of the application by a panel of non-FDA food scientists. The award was approved by the
National Advisory Environmental Health Science Council in September, 1991.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 Under the cooperative agreement, IIT has established and staffed the NCFST at IIT's Moffett Campus in Summit-Argo,
IL. Other participants in this effort are the IIT Research Institute, the Food Science Department of the University
of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign, FDA, and industry. NCFST is structured so that representatives of participating
organizations play a role in establishing policy and administrative procedures, as well as identifying long- and
short-term research needs. With this organizational structure, NCFST is able to build cooperative programs focused
on food safety on a foundation of knowledge about current industrial trends in food processing and packaging technologies,
regulatory perspectives from public health organizations, and fundamental scientific expertise from academia.

II. Mechanism of Support 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
A. Award Instrument 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Support for this program, if granted, will be in the form of a cooperative agreement. In 1994, FDA is providing $2,000,000
for this award. The award will be subject to all policies and requirements that govern the research grant programs
of the Public Health Service (PHS), including the provisions of 42 CFR part 52, 45 CFR part 74, and PHS grants policy
statement.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
B. Length of Support
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The length of support will be 1 year with the possibility of an additional 4 years of noncompetitive support. Continuation,
beyond the first year, will be based upon performance during the preceding year and the availability of Federal fiscal
year appropriations.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
 III. Reasons for Single Source Selection
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 FDA believes that there is compelling evidence that IIT is uniquely qualified to fulfill the objectives of the proposed
cooperative agreement. IIT's Moffett Campus, where NCFST is located, is a unique research facility which includes
an industrial-size pilot plant and smaller pilot plants for food processing and packaging equipment, a biotechnology
laboratory, a packaging laboratory, analytical laboratories, offices, containment facilities, classrooms,
and support facilities which permit research from benchtop to industrial-scale. The industrial-size pilot plant
is built to accommodate routine food processing and packaging research in a commercial atmosphere. The physical
layout of the plant provides maximum versatility in the use and arrangement of equipment of both commercial and pilot
size, and in the capability to simultaneously operate several different pieces of equipment without interference
with each other. In addition to facilities to conduct routine processing research, there are facilities suitable
for more complex research, notably a biotechnology research facility, funded by the State of Illinois, for scale-up
and downstream processing and purification research. Other facilities include containment facilities in which
research involving use of components that may be potentially hazardous, such as pathogens in pasteurization or modified
atmosphere packaging research, may be conducted.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 Since 1988, IIT has provided an environment in which scientists from diverse backgrounds, such as academia, government,
and industry, have brought their unique perspectives to focus on contemporary issues of food safety. NCFST functions
as a neutral ground where scientific exchange about generic food safety issues occurs freely and is channeled into
the design of cooperative food safety programs. NCFST recently convened a meeting of its members to identify and discuss
the mechanisms and safety aspects of new food processing and packaging technologies that are either now moving into
the food manufacturing industry or are expected to be introduced soon, including laser heating, high voltage pulse
processing and high pressure processing, and cold sterilization techniques. Ongoing research on recycling plastics
for food contact use was initiated from a planning meeting that brought together NCFST participants with expertise
and knowledge about plastics recycling, including representatives of government, academia, and industry, to discuss
the status of recycling research in the U.S. industry and regulatory perspectives. The cooperative research that
was generated by this meeting has recently been expanded to include recycling of paperboard for fatty and aqueous
foods, which is a use that is not currently provided for by Federal regulations. This type of research fills existing
gaps in knowledge and expertise associated with recycled packaging materials in a time when many States are mandating
the recycling of packaging materials, and answers questions about safety and use of these materials. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition to research on recycled materials for food container use, the cooperative research program in progress
investigates safety aspects of biotechnological and fermentation techniques, validation of critical controls
in computerized and automated processing lines, and formation of potentially detrimental compounds during high-temperature
processing. This cooperative research will provide fundamental food safety information in the public domain for
use by all segments of the food science community in product and process development, regulatory activities, academic
programs, and consumer programs. A particular use of this type of data by both industry and public health agencies
is in Hazard Analysis Critical Control Point (HACCP) programs. Food manufacturers can use the information in the
design of HACCP programs, which prevent food safety hazards before they occur and enhance the safety of the final product,
for use in their plants.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 An academic degree program in food safety science, which is not part of the cooperative agreement, has been underway
for 3 years at IIT. The program will produce graduates with a foundation in food science and technology with specialization
in food safety. Graduates from this program will manage quality control, safety assurance, and HACCP programs in
industry. They will design equipment and processes for use in the production and packaging of safe food products.
In the public sector, these graduates will evaluate the adequacy of processing and packaging parameters to produce
safe endproducts, as well as manage regulatory and information programs designed to enhance the safety of the food
supply and consumer knowledge about the food supply. Graduate students from IIT and the University of Illinois can
gain hands-on experience in food safety by participating in the cooperative food safety research program. Several
masters of science degrees, which included research conducted on cooperative projects, have been granted in disciplines
such as engineering by IIT since the inception of NCFST. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 Collaboration between the public and the private sector is an efficient means for both to remain current with scientific
and technical accomplishments from a food safety perspective. These collaborative programs will produce generic
knowledge and expertise that can be used by all segments of the food processing and packaging industry, as well as by
public health organizations, regulatory agencies, and academic institutions in the performance of their roles
in the food science community. The trend toward use of HACCP in both the domestic and international food industry,
as a means of assuring safety of products and as a basis for harmonizing regulatory activities, is but one example of
the effects that food safety knowledge and expertise are having. Technology transfer mechanisms, which are developing
out of the cooperative food safety programs, will facilitate the movement of advanced food processing and packaging
technologies into the marketplace, while ensuring the safety of those products.

 IV. Reporting Requirements
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Program progress reports and financial status reports will be required annually, based on date of award. These reports
will be due within 30 days after the end of the budget period. A final program progress report and financial status report
will be due 90 days after expiration of the project period of the cooperative agreement.

 V. Delineation of Substantive Involvement 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Substantive involvement by the awarding agency is inherent in the cooperative agreement award. Accordingly, FDA
will have substantial involvement in the program activities of the project funded by the cooperative agreement.
Substantive involvement includes, but is not limited to, the following: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 1. FDA will appoint a project officer or coproject officers who will actively monitor the FDA-supported program under
this award. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 2. FDA will have prior approval on the appointment of all key administrative and scientific personnel proposed by
the grantee. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 3. FDA will be directly involved in the guidance and development of the program and of the personnel management structure
for the program. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
  4. FDA scientists will participate, with the grantee, in determining and carrying out the methodological approaches
to be used. Collaboration will also include data analysis, interpretation of findings, and where appropriate, coauthorship
of publications.

 VI. Use of the Metric System
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 In order to be eligible for this FDA grant program, applications must be in compliance with the Metric Conversion Act
of 1975 (as amended by the Omnibus Trade and Competitiveness Act of 1988) which requires that the metric system be used
in all Federal procurements, grants, and business-related activities. Therefore, all applications submitted
under this notice which contain measurement-sensitive information and/or data, must reflect such data using the
metric system. During this period of transition, both metric and inch-pound units will be used simultaneously to
express measurements. Examples of measurements that should now be reflected in metrics include: (1) Travel (if applicable)
in kilometers (km); (2) office or laboratory space (if applicable) in square meters (m
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
2
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
); (3) audio/visual (film) (if applicable) in millimeters (mm); and (4) publications (if applicable) in centimeters
(cm). Applications found not to be in compliance will be returned to the applicant without consideration. Written
requests for exemption from the requirement will be considered on a case-by-case basis. If additional costs are incurred
due to implementation of this requirement, such costs may be considered as allowable if bonafide supporting justification
is presented. The grants management officer will determine the allowability of such costs.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
 VII. Smoke-Free Workplace
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 PHS strongly encourages all grant recipients to provide a smoke-free workplace and promote the non-use of all tobacco
products. This is consistent with the PHS mission to protect and advance the physical and mental health of the American
people.

This transaction is related to a number of proceedings that involved Iowa Power, Inc. (Iowa Power), formerly Iowa
Power and Light Company. Iowa Power was authorized to construct a new, alternative rail line to serve its Council Bluffs
Energy Center (Energy Center). The proposal to develop this alternative rail line grew out of the complaint proceeding
filed and subsequently dismissed in Iowa Power and Light Company v. Burlington Northern Railroad Company, No. 40224
(ICC served Nov. 1, 1991). Iowa Power has since merged with the Iowa Public Service Company to form Midwest Power Systems,
Inc. (Systems). Systems' electric division is now known as Midwest Power.

 One component of the original construction plan called for Iowa Power to acquire and CBEC to operate the line segment
at issue here, plus an additional 0.7-mile segment between mileposts 407.7 and 407.0. Iowa Power, Inc. and CBEC Railway
Inc._Acquisition and Operation Exemption_Iowa Southern Railroad Company Line near Council Bluffs, IA, Finance
Docket No. 31718 (ICC served Aug. 17, 1990). In a related proceeding, Iowa Power was granted an exemption to construct
a connecting 1.8-mile rail line extending from milepost 407.0 to the Energy Center, subject to further consideration
of the anticipated environmental impacts. Iowa Power_Const. Exempt._Council Bluffs, IA, 8 I.C.C.2d 858 (1990)

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The acquisition transaction in Finance Docket No. 31718 was never consummated. Instead, the line segment, less the
0.7-mile segment between mileposts 407.7 and 407.0, was subsequently acquired by Great Western in Great Western
Railway Company of Iowa, Inc._Acquisition and Operation Exemption_Council Bluffs and Ottumwa Railway, Inc., Finance
Docket No. 31873 (ICC served May 24, 1991). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
By acquiring this line segment from Great Western, CBEC will be able to finalize its plans to construct the alternative
rail line. A draft environmental assessment of the construction proposal, modified to reflect that the new line will
connect with the line being acquired here at milepost 407.7, instead of at milepost 407.0 as originally authorized,
is being considered by the Commission in Iowa Power. There the parties also requested that CBEC be substituted for
Iowa Power as the party authorized to construct and operate the new line.

The Complaint alleges that the defendant, Electronic Payment Services, Inc. (``EPS''), the owner of the MAC automatic
teller machine network, has forced MAC member institutions to purchase ATM processing from EPS and that this is a per
se unlawful tying arrangement between regional ATM network access and ATM processing. The Complaint also alleges
that the tying arrangement is a means by which EPS has maintained a monopoly in regional ATM network access in Pennsylvania,

Complaint
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The United States of America, by its attorneys, acting under the direction of the Attorney General of the United States,
brings this civil action to obtain equitable and other relief against the defendant named herein and complains and
alleges as follows:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
Nature of This Action
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
1. The United States brings this civil antitrust action to obtain permanent injunctive relief against an anticompetitive
practice of defendant Electronic Payment Services, Inc. (``EPS'') that constitutes a tying arrangement that is

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
per se 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
unlawful under Sherman Act section 1, 15 U.S.C. 1, and that constitutes a means whereby EPS unlawfully has maintained
a monopoly in access to regional automatic teller machine (``ATM'') networks in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania
and the States of New Jersey, Delaware, West Virginia and New Hampshire, and in substantial portions of the State of
Ohio (collectively the ``affected states''), all in violation of Sherman Act section 2, 15 U.S.C. 2.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. EPS owns and operates the Money Access Service (``MAC'') ATM network, which has market power or monopoly power in
the market for regional ATM network access in the affected states. EPS generally prohibits its customers_banks,
savings and loan associations and credit unions (collectively ``banks'') that seek to make ATM network services
available to their depositors_from obtaining ATM processing services (described at paragraph 6 below) from independent
data processing firms who seek to compete for that business. Instead EPS requires MAC customers either to obtain those
services from EPS or to provide them in-house, at a cost that is prohibitive for many smaller banks.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. As more fully described below, EPS's tying practice not only serves to raise the cost to banks of processing services,
but also prevents banks from participating in more than one regional ATM network. Defendant thereby has maintained
its monopoly in the affected states.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. The United States seeks a permanent injunction, pursuant to Sherman Act section 4, 15 U.S.C. 4, prohibiting EPS
from refusing to allow its customers to obtain ATM processing from third party processors; requiring EPS to connect
to those third party processors on nondiscriminatory terms; and other and further relief appropriate to remedy these
violations.

Definitions
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
5. ``ATM network'' means an arrangement whereby more than one ATM and more than one depository institution (or the
deposit records of such depository institutions) are interconnected by electronic or telecommunications means,
to one or more computers, processors or switches for the purpose of providing ATM services to the retail customers
of depository institutions.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
6. ``ATM processing'' means providing the data processing services and telecommunications facilities and services
used:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. To operate, monitor and support the operation of ATMs deployed by a depository institution;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. To connect the ATMs deployed by a depository institution to that institution's deposit authorization records,
for authorization and confirmation of ``on-us transactions,'' and the record-keeping and other functions related
to such transactions; and
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. To connect the ATMs deployed by a depository institution to one or more branded ATM networks for authorization and
confirmation of ``on-others transactions,'' and the record-keeping and other functions related to such transactions.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 02 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
ATM processing can be provided as a service distinct from branded ATM network access, and can be performed in the facilities
of the ATM switch, a depository institution's own facilities, or in the facilities of a data processing service organization.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
7. ``ATM switch'' means a telecommunications and data processing facility used to receive and route transactions
from ATMs or ATM processors to data processing facilities used by depository institutions to authorize ATM transactions.
A ``MAC switch'' is an ATM switch operated by or on behalf of, or providing such functionality for branded ATM network
access to, MAC or any successor branded ATM network controlled by defendant.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
8. ``Interceptor processor'' means a depository institution that provides ATM processing for itself.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
9. ``MAC'' means Money Access Service, the branded ATM network owned, controlled and operated by EPS, or any successor
brand to ``MAC.''
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
10. ``Third party processor'' means any person that currently or in the future offers ATM processing services to depository
institutions. Third party processors may include both depository institutions providing ATM processing for other
depository institutions and firms unaffiliated with depository institutions that provide such services.

Party Defendant, Jurisdiction and Venue
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
11. EPS is made a defendant in this action. EPS has its principal place of business at 1100 Carr Road, Wilmington, Delaware
19809. EPS is owned by four bank holding companies: CoreStates Financial Corp., Philadelphia, Pa.; PNC Financial
Corp., Pittsburgh, Pa; Banc One Corp., Columbus, Ohio; and KeyCorp, Albany, New York. EPS owns and operates MAC, a
regional ATM network, and other businesses. ``EPS'' and ``MAC'' are used interchangeably in this Complaint.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
12. This Court has jurisdiction over the subject matter of this civil antitrust action pursuant to Section 4 of the
Sherman Act, 15 U.S.C. 4. This Court has jurisdiction over EPS pursuant to Section 12 of the Clayton Act, 15 U.S.C. 22.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
13. EPS is a Delaware corporation, and is found and transacts business in the District of Delaware. Venue is proper
in the District of Delaware pursuant to 15 U.S.C. 12 and 28 U.S.C. 1491.

Interstate Commerce
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
14. Defendant's MAC ATM network is the largest ATM network in the United States by transaction volume. In 1992, the
MAC network handled 92 million transactions monthly for 1,455 depository institutions deploying 13 thousand ATMs.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
15. The MAC network operates in interstate commerce, and defendant's practices affect interstate commerce.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
The MAC ATM Network and Its Practices
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
16. ATMs permit a depositor, using an ATM card and personal identification number, to obtain cash, monitor account
balances, and transfer money or make payments. Some ATMs also permit customers to make deposits, and some dispense
items of value other than cash (such as travelers checks, railroad tickets, etc.) ATMs usually are owned and maintained
by individual banks, and are deployed by banks on premises and at other public locations convenient to their customers.

<!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
17. ATMs typically are connected by telephone wires to a computer that provides processing, also known as driving,
for several ATMs. That computer often is connected to a network switch, such as the MAC switch, for interchange of transactions
among otherwise unaffiliated banks. An ATM network typically charges a switch fee per transaction, and may also charge
various monthly or annual membership fees. The processor charges a separate fee for its services. Outside the MAC
network, the driving computer might be operated by the bank, by a network, or by an independent data processing firm,
and driving computer might connect those ATMs to several different networks. MAC's rules and practices, however,
constrain interconnection of different ATM networks. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
18. Banks seek to participate in shared ATM networks, such as MAC, in order to give their depositors ubiquitous access
to their accounts. While a bank can deploy its own ATMs, the advantage to a shared ATM network is that a bank's depositors
will be able to use ATMs at many more locations than one bank alone could practicably support. The areas a bank seeks
to serve through a shared ATM network include the areas in which its depositors live, work and ship, and the broader
areas in which they move regularly. A bank's ability to offer its depositors access to other bank's ATMs, and thereby
to offer its depositors convenient access to their accounts, is in most bankers' view necessary to attract and retain
deposits. A bank_particularly a small bank, thrift or credit union with one or only a few offices_would be at a competitive
disadvantage if it could not offer its depositors access to many conveniently located ATMs. Because no other service
constitutes a reasonably close substitute for regional ATM network access, regional ATM networks constitutes a
product market and a line of commerce within the meaning of the antitrust laws. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
19. The MAC network is the dominant ATM network in the affected states. In Pennsylvania, New Jersey and Delaware, more
than 90% of the ATMs are connected to MAC; in New Hampshire, approximately 80% of the ATMs are connected to MAC. No other
regional network has a significant presence in Pennsylvania, Delaware, West Virginia or New Hampshire. Although
the New York Cash Exchange (``NYCE``) ATM network has a presence in New Jersey, for reasons set forth below, EPS's MAC
network nonetheless has monopoly or market power in New Jersey. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
20. Nearly all banks in the affected states believe they have no choice but to participate in the MAC network. Banks
in the affected states affiliate with MAC because MAC is the only ATM network that provides ubiquitous ATM network
access throughout all or most of the contiguous affected states. Banks that do not seek to provide regional ATM network
access in areas smaller than these States do not have significantly greater alternatives than do statewide banks.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
21. Banks in the affected states often obtain ATM network access from MAC even though defendant's switching and processing
fees, and other costs of doing business with MAC, are higher than those charged by other networks and by independent
processors. Defendant has market power in the market for regional ATM network access in the affected states. That
market power is of sufficient size and durability to constitute monopoly power. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
22. Until 1992, MAC generally did not permit its customers to participate in rival ATM networks while also participating
in MAC. While the rule against multiple affiliations was formally dropped in 1992, MAC engages in practices that make
it impractical for many participating banks_particularly smaller banks_to belong to a rival network while belonging
to MAC. In particular, MAC requires banks either to obtain ATM driving from defendant or to provide ATM driving in-house
as intercept processors, which is prohibitively expensive for many smaller banks, thrifts and credit unions. MAC
generally forbids its network customers from obtaining ATM driving from any of the several data processing firms
that provide that service in a national market.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
23. There are several regional and national firms in the business of ATM processing that could and would seek to compete
to provide ATM driving services to MAC network members. Absent MAC's prohibition, many MAC customers would seek to
obtain ATM processing from these or other firms. Defendant's rules and practices thus prevent willing buyers and
sellers from conducting business at competitively determined prices and terms. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
24. Once defendant drives a bank's ATM, defendant can prevent that bank from connecting its ATM to another network.
To connect to a network other than MAC, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
MAC 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
must establish the connection. MAC generally has not provided connections to the ATM networks that would be its strongest
competitors.

<!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
25. The anticompetitive effects of MAC's ``no-third-party-processing'' rule are twofold.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a. First, it excludes competitors from the market for ATM processing in areas where MAC has market power in the market
for ATM network access, extending the exercise of that market power into the processing market and permitting MAC
to charge higher prices_which it does both directly and indirectly; and
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
b. Second, by preventing many banks from participating in networks other than MAC, the rule makes it substantially
more difficult for other networks to enter into MAC's areas of dominance to compete with MAC. The rule therefore serves
to exclude competitors and maintain MAC's monopoly power.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
26. The rule against third party processing is not necessary to obtain any efficiencies or quality control assurances
that could not reasonably be obtained through less anticompetitive means. MAC allows some of its largest members
to use third party processors, and permits those third party processors to connect to MAC, but will not allow those
same third party processors to prove ATM driving services to other smaller MAC customers.

First Violation Alleged
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
27. The United States repeats and realleges the allegations of paragraphs 1 to 26 herein.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
28. The provision by defendant of ATM network access and processing services pursuant to MAC's rules, constitute
an agreement or agreements within the meaning of Section 1 of the Sherman Act.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
29. Regional ATM network access and ATM processing are separate products.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
30. Defendant has market power in the market for regional ATM network access in the affected states.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
31. The amount of commerce affected in the market for ATM processing in the affected states is substantial.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
32. Defendant's rules and practices act to force many of its ATM network access customers to purchase ATM processing
from defendant, rather than from other firms of the customer's choosing.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
33. Defendant's tying arrangement unreasonably restrains trade and is unlawful 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

34. The United States repeats and realleges the allegations of paragraphs 1 to 33 herein.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
35. Defendant possesses substantial monopoly power in the market for regional ATM network access in the affected
states.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
36. Defendant willfully has maintained its monopoly power in the market for regional ATM network access in the affected
states through exclusionary practices.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
37. Defendant's actions and practices constitute unlawful monopolization under Section 2 of the Sherman Act.

Prayer for Relief
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Wherefore, plaintiff the United States prays that:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a. Defendant be enjoined from requiring any depository institution that obtains ATM network access from defendant
to obtain any ATM processing from defendant; from selling or contracting to see access to, membership in, or switching
of transactions by the MAC network, on the condition, agreement, or understanding that the purchaser thereof shall
not use or purchase ATM processing services from any other person; or from restricting in any manner, directly or indirectly,
the ability of a depository institution to obtain ATM processing for access to the MAC ATM network from any person other
than defendant;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
b. Defendant be enjoined to provide third party processors with nondiscriminatory access to the MAC switch that is
at least equal in type and quality to the access MAC provides to intercept processors;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
c. Defendant be enjoined from discriminating in the pricing of access to the MAC network;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
d. The United States be granted such other structural, injunctive or further relief as this Court may deem just and
proper; and
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
e. The United States recover the costs in this action.

Stipulation
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
It is hereby stipulated and agreed, by and between the undersigned parties, by their respective attorneys, that:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. The parties consent that a Final Judgment in the form hereto attached may be filed and entered by the Court, upon the
motion of any party or upon the Court's own motion, at any time after compliance with the requirements of the Antitrust
Procedures and Penalties Act, 15 U.S.C. 16, and without further notice to any party or other proceedings, provided
that plaintiff has not withdrawn its consent, which it may do at any time before the entry of the proposed Final Judgment
by serving notice thereof on defendants and by filing that notice with the Court.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. The parties shall abide by and comply with paragraphs IV.J.4 and IV.J.5 of the proposed Final Judgment pending entry
of the Final Judgment. The parties likewise shall abide by and comply with all other paragraphs of Section IV of the
proposed Final Judgment pending its entry, provided that, not later than September 1, 1994, the public comment period
provided for in 15 U.S.C. 16 shall have expired and the Department of Justice shall have filed with the district court
its motion for entry of the proposed Final Judgment in its entirety and without modification.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. In the event plaintiff withdraws its consent or if the proposed Final Judgment is not entered pursuant to this Stipulation,

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Final Judgment shall apply to defendant and each of its affiliates, subsidiaries, officers, directors, employees,
agents, successors, and assigns; to any successor to any substantial part of the MAC business; to any entity that controls

Prohibited Conduct
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Defendant is permanently enjoined and restrained as follows:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A. Defendant shall not require any depository institution that obtains branded ATM network access from defendant
to obtain any ATM processing or authorization processing from defendant. Defendant shall not maintain or enforce
any rule, policy, contract, agreement or arrangement pursuant to which defendant requires any depository institution
to obtain ATM processing or authorization processing from defendant; that prohibits or purports to prohibit a depository
institution from obtaining ATM processing or authorization processing from any third party processor; or that conditions
MAC membership or availability of MAC or any successor branded ATM network access on any depository institution's
obtaining ATM processing or authorization processing from defendant or not obtaining ATM processing or authorization
processing from a qualified third party processor.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
B. Defendant shall not sell or contract to sell access to, membership in, or switching of transactions by the MAC or
any successor branded ATM network controlled by defendant, on the condition, agreement, or understanding that the
purchaser thereof shall not use or purchase ATM processing or authorization processing services from any other person.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
C. Defendant shall not establish as any condition, agreement, or understanding with respect to access to, membership
in, or switching of transactions by the MAC or any successor branded ATM network controlled by defendant, or the price
or terms of such access, membership, or switching, that the purchaser thereof shall not use or purchase ATM processing
or authorization processing services from any other person. Defendant shall not impose any additional fees on any
depository institution based on its obtaining ATM processing or authorization processing from any person other
than defendant, except that defendant may impose additional fees for set-up and establishment of the network. Defendant
will not require an unreasonable amount of set-up and establishment testing and certification. The aggregate of
set-up and/or establishment fees charged to a depository institution, as allowed by this paragraph, and/or its third
party processor, as allowed by paragraph IV.E.2 of this Final Judgment, shall not exceed $100 per person hour expended
by Defendant up to a maximum of $1,000 unless significant difficulties that require additional work are caused by
the third party processor or the depository institution. In such case, Defendant will charge $100 per hour for the
next 40 person hours and $250 per hour for each additional hour that it expends. The hourly rates and maximum fees set
forth in this paragraph may be adjusted over the term of this Final Judgment in accordance with the Consumer Price Index.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
D. Defendant shall not restrict in any manner, directly or indirectly, the ability of a depository institution to
obtain ATM processing or authorization processing for access to the MAC or any successor branded ATM network controlled
by defendant from any qualified third party processor. Defendant shall not require any depository institution that
obtains ATM processing or authorization processing from a third party processor to obtain any other service that
is not required to provide such ATM or authorization processing from that processor or from any other person.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
E. Defendant shall provide qualified third party processors with nondiscriminatory branded ATM network access
to the MAC or any successor branded ATM network controlled by defendant that is at least equal in type and quality to
the access defendant: (a) Provides to intercept processors, and (b) provided to intercept processors as of the date
of the commencement of this action. Defendant shall not deny any qualified third party processor access to telecommunications
ports or links necessary for the third party processor to provide ATM processing or authorization processing for
depository institutions obtaining ATM network access from defendant. Defendant shall permit qualified third party
processors to aggregate transactions of multiple banks over one or several telecommunications links and ports as
technically reasonable, and defendant shall not require third party processors to obtain a separate link or port
for each of its depository institution customers. A third party processor is qualified, within the meaning of this
Final Judgment, if it completes defendant's certification process and meets:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. The technical, financial and operating criteria for intercept processors and third party processors that provide
services to only one depository institution established by defendant and in effect as of the date of commencement
of this action, or such other reasonable and nondiscriminatory technical, financial and operating criteria for
intercept processors and third party processors hereafter established by defendant; and

<!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
2. Such additional technical criteria regarding transaction information transmitted and the format for transmission
of such information as is reasonably appropriate for third party ATM processing for unaffiliated multiple banks.
No such criteria shall distinguish or discriminate between intercept processors and third party processors, except
that volume discounts may be offered in a nondiscriminatory manner as provided in paragraph IV.G of this Final Judgment.
Defendant shall not require any third party processor to satisfy additional certification requirements, or pay
additional certification fees (other than reasonable set-up fees), by reason of its seeking or obtaining the business
of additional customers as long as the processor elects to employ for these additional customers a message format/communications
protocol combination for which defendant already has certified the processor.

<!-- PJG /QTAG -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
Notwithstanding the foregoing, Defendant is not required to certify as a qualified processor any branded ATM network
that is dominant on a state-wide basis or a subsidiary of such network that seeks to become a qualified processor in
the MAC or any successor branded ATM network controlled by Defendant unless reciprocal access to become a processor
in that network is available on a substantially similar basis as to pricing and terms to all qualified third party processors
including other branded ATM networks that offer third party ATM or authorization processing to depository institutions.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
F. Defendant shall not terminate any third party processor's access to the MAC or any successor branded ATM network
controlled by defendant except on written notice to the processor thirty (30) days before such termination, except
that Defendant can terminate any processor immediately if that processor: (1) Fails to pay at any time specified fees,
charges or other amounts due and owed to defendant or any participant in defendant's branded ATM network; (2) violates
any law or government regulation applicable to it that has adverse effect upon the MAC or any successor branded ATM
network controlled by defendant; (3) has a bankruptcy or insolvency proceeding filed against it; or (4) appoints
or has appointed by court order a trustee or receiver for any substantial part of its property. Defendant shall provide
a copy of any notice of termination to the Antitrust Division of the Department of Justice, to the attention of counsel
of record or their named successors. Any termination in violation of this Final Judgment shall constitute a contempt
of this Court and be punishable thereby. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
G. Defendant shall not discriminate in the pricing of branded ATM network access to the MAC or any successor branded
ATM network controlled by defendant on the basis of a customer's choice of ATM processor, but shall offer branded ATM
network access on a nondiscriminatory basis, except that: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. Defendant may offer volume discounts on branded ATM network access fees on a nondiscriminatory basis, provided
that defendant shall permit any depository institution or third party processor for a depository institution to
aggregate that institution's transaction volume delivered to a MAC switch, and any such depository institution
shall be entitled to any such nondiscriminatory volume discount. Defendant shall not offer volume discounts to a
depository institution operating as an intercept processor that are more favorable than those offer to a depository
institution that obtains ATM or authorization processing from a qualified third party processor. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. Defendant shall be permitted to offer depository institutions the option of obtaining transaction switching
between member depository institutions by third party processors at nondiscriminatory royalties that shall not
be greater than the price for switched transactions.

<!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
3. Defendant shall provide branded ATM network access pursuant to a nondiscriminatory price schedule applicable
at least to depository institutions located in the States of Pennsylvania, New Jersey, and Delaware. Defendant's
provision of branded ATM network access in States other than Pennsylvania, New Jersey, and Delaware, pursuant to
a nondiscriminatory price schedule in one State, shall not be deemed to be discriminatory by reason of the use of a different
price schedule in another State.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
H. Defendant shall not restrict in any manner the ability of a depository institution to obtain branded ATM network
access through qualified third party processors or through their own intercept processor facilities to multiple
providers of branded ATM network access. Defendant shall not condition its provision of branded ATM network access
on a depository institution's not obtaining branded ATM network access from any other person. Defendant shall not
sell or contract to sell access to, membership in, or switching of transactions by any branded ATM network controlled
by defendant, on the condition, agreement, or understanding that the purchaser thereof shall not use or purchase
branded ATM network access from any other person, or establish a price for, discount from, or rebate upon access to,
membership in, or switching of transactions by the MAC or any successor branded ATM network controlled by defendant,
on the condition, agreement, or understanding that the purchaser thereof shall not use or purchase branded ATM network
access from any other person. Defendant shall in no manner restrict any depository institution ATM deployer that
chooses to be affiliated with multiple ATM networks from displaying multiple ATM network logos on its ATMs. Defendant
shall not prohibit any depository institution ATM card issuer located in the States of Pennsylvania, New Jersey,
Delaware, Indiana or Ohio that chooses to be affiliated with multiple ATM networks from issuing cards that display
multiple ATM network logos. Notwithstanding the preceding, Defendant may require that its ATM network logo be displayed
on ATMs and ATM cards in equal frequency and prominence as the logos of any other ATM networks and may restrict the branding
of access cards that contain an integrated circuit computer chip with a stored value function. Defendant shall in
no manner restrict any depository institution ATM deployer from enabling ATMs to function in multiple ATM networks.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
I. Notwithstanding the preceding, defendant is not enjoined from entering into an agreement, not inconsistent with
the terms of this Final Judgment, for the provision of ATM processing or authorization processing to any depository
institution to which defendant has provided actual notice of, and a true copy of, this Final Judgment. Any such agreement
shall be severable from any agreement to provide branded ATM network access to the MAC or any successor branded ATM
network controlled by defendant.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
J. The injunctions specified in Sections IV.A through IV.E of this Final Judgment shall become effective as provided
by the terms of this paragraph:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. Defendant shall commence certification of third party processors not later than January 1, 1995, except that defendant

Nature and Purpose of the Proceedings

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
On April 21, 1994, the United States filed a civil antitrust complaint pursuant to Section 4 of the Sherman Act, as amended,
15 U.S.C. 4, against defendant Electronic Payment Services, Inc. (``EPS''), owner of the Money Access Service (``MAC'')
regional automatic teller machine (``ATM'') network.
<FOOTCITE>1</FOOTCITE>
 The complaint alleges that EPS's refusal to allow the MAC network's bank customers
<FOOTCITE>2</FOOTCITE>
 to obtain ATM processing services from providers other than EPS violates the antitrust laws.

Pennsylvania; PNC Financial Corporation, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania; Banc One Corporation, Columbus, Ohio; and
KeyCorp, Albany, New York (successor to Society Corporation, Cleveland, Ohio). These four bank holding companies
consolidated their various ATM networks (MAC, Owl, Jubilee and Green Machine) into EPS. MAC had previously been owned

The customers of an ATM network are the depository institutions (banks, savings banks, savings and loan associations
and credit unions) that seek to give their depositors access to an ATM network. These depository institutions are
referred to collectively as ``banks'' in this Competitive Impact Statement.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
</FOOTNOTE>

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The complaint's two counts allege: (1) That a business practice of EPS is a tying arrangement that is 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
per se 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
unlawful under Section 1 of the Sherman Act, as amended, 15 U.S.C. 1, and (2) that this typing arrangement is a means
by which EPS has maintained a monopoly in regional ATM network access in the States of Pennsylvania, New Jersey, Delaware,
West Virginia and New Hampshire, and in substantial portions of the State of Ohio (the ``affected states''), in violation
of Section 2 of the Sherman Act, as amended, 15 U.S.C. 2.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The effect of this practice is to foreclose competition from competing data processing companies in the affected
states. Furthermore, because those competing data processing companies would otherwise provide means by which
MAC member banks could access competing regional ATM networks, this practice has the effect of excluding those networks
and maintaining EPS's monopoly in regional ATM network access in the affected states. The complaint seeks an injunction
prohibiting EPS from continuing the tying arrangement, and other relief.

The Antitrust Division of the United States Department of Justice has conducted an extensive investigation of EPS's
business practices. That investigation shows the following:

ATMs and ATM Networks. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
ATMs are machines typically owned and deployed by banks and used by their depositors with ATM cards most frequently
to withdraw cash, but also to accomplish balance inquiries, deposits, payment authorizations, and transfers. An
ATM network is an electronic telecommunications systems connecting various banks, their ATMs, and data processing
companies, which allows an account holder of one bank to accomplish transactions at ATMs not owned by that bank.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

</FOOTNAME>
<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->
Some banks and bank holding companies operate switches connecting only the ATMs deployed by branches of their own
bank or their subsidiary banks, rather than connecting to non-affiliated banks. These networks are also generally
referred to as ATM networks. However, in this Competitive Impact Statement, the term ``network'' is used to refer
to what is sometimes called a ``shared network,'' in that it connects multiple non-affiliated banks.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
</FOOTNOTE>

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Most ATM networks are ``regional,'' operating in areas encompassing a state or several contiguous states. ATMs and
ATM cards within the regional ATM network display a mark or brand identifying the network, so that depositors can identify
the ATMs from which they may access their accounts. National ATM networks exist, but these are by design networks of
last resort, used only where the two banks involved in a transaction do not both belong to any one regional ATM network.
National ATM network transactions are typically more expensive, and those networks provide only a subset of the transactions
available through regional ATM networks.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
An ATM network allows banks to provide their depositors with ubiquitous, 24-hour access to their accounts. A bank
that becomes a member of a regional ATM network can offer its depositors access to their accounts not just at the bank's
own ATMs, but also at other banks' ATMs. Bankers believe that the ability to offer depositors the convenience of access
to their accounts at other banks' ATMs is necessary to attract and retain deposits. A bank_especially a small bank,
thrift or credit union with one or only a few offices, and that deploys few, if any, ATMs_would be at a significant competitive
disadvantage without the ability to offer its depositors access to many conveniently located ATMs. No other service
is a close substitute for regional ATM network access, and regional ATM network access constitutes a product market
within the meaning of the antitrust laws.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
ATM processing. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
``ATM processing'' consists of the data processing services and telecommunications facilities and services used
to operate, monitor and support the operation of ATMs deployed by a bank. ATM processing also involves the connection
of the ATMs deployed by a bank to that bank's deposit records, for authorization and confirmation of that bank's depositors'
transactions, and the connection of the ATMs deployed by a bank to one or more ATM networks for authorization and confirmation
of other banks' depositors' transactions. Finally, ATM processing connects ATMs to an ATM network or to several ATM
networks.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A bank can purchase this ATM processing service from a regional ATM network or from an independent data processing
company (``third party processor''), or can provide this processing service to itself (as an ``intercept processor'').
However, a bank must deploy a large number of ATMs before it becomes economical to provide ATM processing internally.
Accordingly, small banks, thrifts, and credit unions very rarely act as intercept processors.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Competitive effects of third party processors. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Third party processors provide banks, especially smaller ones, with a competitive source for ATM processing. Equally
important, third party processors offer a channel for the entry of competing regional ATM networks. Third party processors
typically maintain connections to several regional ATM networks, and those networks therefore can reach all of the
banks connected to a third party processor. Accordingly, the cost of and barriers to entry of regional ATM networks
fall dramatically.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition, third party processors themselves are potential entrants. Because a third party processor could switch
transactions among its customer banks itself (a process known as ``subswitching'') rather than passing those transactions
to the network switch, it is a potential ``unbranded'' ATM network. To become a competitor to the existing branded
regional ATM networks, the third party processor need only put its brand on the ATMs and ATM cards of its customer banks
and begin switching transactions.

B. EPS and Its Actions
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The complaint alleges that EPS has monopoly power in ATM network access in the affected states, and that EPS has illegally
tied the sale of access to its MAC regional ATM network to the sale of the ATM processing for many of EPS's bank customers.
The complaint also alleges that this illegal tying arrangement has worked to maintain EPS's monopoly power in the
market for regional ATM network access in the affected states. This section, discusses EPS's actions and their anticompetitive
effects in more detail.

Elimination of ATM processing competition.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 EPS requires its member banks to purchase ATM processing services from EPS or provide it themselves as intercept processors.
<FOOTCITE>4</FOOTCITE>
 The effect of this rule is that small banks, thrifts, and credit unions_banks that cannot economically become intercept
processors_are forced to purchase ATM processing from EPS. This rule has foreclosed third party processors from
competing for banks' ATM processing business within the MAC regional ATM network.

</FOOTNOTE>

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
EPS's exclusion of third party processor competition from the MAC network has allowed EPS to exact very high profits
from small banks, thrifts and credit unions. EPS has done so via two sorts of fees. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
First
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, and most directly, EPS charges much more per ATM for ATM processing than third party processors typically charge.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Second
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, EPS increases its own switching volume and revenues by prohibiting third party processing. Where EPS drives a bank's
ATMs, every transaction at those ATMs passes through the MAC switch and is charged to the bank as a switched transaction,
including those transactions by the bank's own depositors (its ``on-us'' transactions). In contrast, intercept
processors and banks that use third party processors do not send on-us transactions to a network switch. If banks could
use third party processors, MAC would not process, or collect switch fees, for those on-us transactions. Without
third party processors, EPS's switch volume and switch fee revenues are commensurately higher.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPS's switch fees hit hardest those MAC banks with the fewest ATM processing options. EPS banks large enough to be intercept
processors escape the EPS charge for ``on-us'' transactions, and only pay MAC switch fees when their depositors use
other banks' ATMs. The smaller banks that cannot afford to be intercept processors pay switch fees for a much higher
proportion of their depositors' transactions. EPS takes advantage of this by imposing on its membership the steepest
switch fee schedule in the industry.
<FOOTCITE>5</FOOTCITE>
 The result is that the small banks that are forced_by EPS's third party processing restriction_to send all their ATM
transactions to the MAC switch must also pay very high fees for the switching of those transactions.

MAC switch fees range from a low of 5&cent; (what large member banks with a large number of ATMs and transactions pay)
to a high of 25&cent; (what the smaller banks with fewer ATMs and transactions_the ones effected by EPS's third party
processing restriction_usually must pay). No other major regional ATM network excludes third party processors,
and all have much flatter switch fee schedules: e.g. Star, 3.5&cent; to 8&cent;; NYCE, 6&cent; to 13&cent;; Honor,
2&cent; to 10&cent;; Most, 3.5&cent; to 14&cent;; Pulse 6&cent;; Accel/Exchange, 12&cent;; Yankee 24, 12&cent;;

Deterrence of entry by competitor regional ATM networks.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The complaint alleges that a further anticompetitive effect of the illegal tying arrangement is to maintain EPS's
market power in the market for regional ATM network access in the affected states. EPS's third party processor prohibition
has insulated the MAC regional ATM network from the competitive influences of third party processors. This subsection
gives a history of the MAC network's largely successful efforts to keep competitors out of its core areas, and explains
how EPS's current practice of excluding third party processors from the MAC network deters entry today.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
A History of anticompetitive practices.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 For most of its existence and until 1992, the MAC network explicitly prohibited its bank customers from belonging
to other regional ATM networks. MAC combined this practice with a number of strategic purchases of adjacent regional
ATM networks. These acquisitions, the prohibition on multiple regional ATM network affiliation, and the third party
processor prohibition together proved to be a formidable force for keeping the affected states free from competition.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Effect of the third party processor prohibition.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 EPS's third party processing prohibition forces small banks that cannot economically provide their own ATM processing
to purchase the service from EPS. Because EPS effectively controls the communications links of their ATMs, these
banks cannot connect their ATMs to other regional ATM networks without the assistance_and approval_of EPS. EPS therefore
exercises an effective veto over these banks' access to other networks in the affected states, and conversely, other
networks' access to these banks. Third party processors, on the other hand, often offer access to several regional
ATM networks. If these banks were able to utilize third party processors, other regional networks would be much more
likely to seek and obtain their business. EPS's control over access to other regional ATM networks prevents these
networks from entering the affected states.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

</FOOTNAME>
<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->
EPS offers its members``gateways'' through MAC to a few regional ATM networks, but controls the price and terms of
this route of access. EPS does not offer gateways to most regional ATM networks operating in areas adjacent to the affected
states, which would offer the greatest competition to MAC. Gateways therefore do not remove the entry barrier to regional
ATM networks created by EPS's restrictions on third party processing.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
</FOOTNOTE>

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
EPS's exclusion of third party processors also prevents the establishment of new networks. As discussed above, if
third party processing were allowed in the affected states, a third party processor could almost instantly form a
new network simply by placing a new ``brand'' on the ATMs and cards of its customer banks. The third party processor
would then switch these banks' transactions itself. The MAC network would switch transactions in only two cases:
(1) When a depositor of a bank connected to the third party processor used an ATM owned by a bank not connected to the third
party processor; or (2) when a depositor of a bank not connected to the third party processor used an ATM owned by a bank
connected to the third party processor.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
While EPS excludes third party processors from the MAC network, would-be entrant regional ATM networks are substantially
unable to enter. The small banks that wish to join another network (which might offer ATM network access at lower prices)
will not be able to do so unless the other network has enough of a presence to provide small banks' depositors with sufficient
ubiquity and convenience. The entrant network, of course, cannot achieve the critical mass necessary to attract
banks. Accordingly, EPS's third party processing restriction creates what economists call a ``collective action
problem,'' and EPS's monopoly persists.

First claim for relief_tying.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The actions and policies of EPS described above constitute a tying arrangement that is per se unlawful under Section
1 of the Sherman Act. An unlawful tying arrangement is one in which two separate products are sold together, the seller
forces buyers to purchase these products together, the seller has market power in the tying product, and the tying
arrangement prevents what would otherwise be a substantial amount of commerce in the tied product.

The two products in this case are regional ATM network access and ATM processing, which outside of MAC can be, and often
are, purchased separately. As described above, however, EPS's practices force banks wishing to obtain membership
in MAC, and thereby access to its regional ATM network, to also purchase ATM processing from MAC. Because MAC is the
only ubiquitous regional ATM network in the affected states and banks will not forego access to such a network, EPS
has market power in this tying product. Evidence gathered in the investigation indicates that there is substantial
commerce in the tied product.

2. Second claim for relief-monopolization.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 EPS's actions and practices also constitute monopolization in violation of Section 2 of the Sherman Act. An unlawful
monopoly involves both the possession of monopoly power in the relevant market and the willful acquisition or maintenance
of that power. Willful acquisition or maintenance of a monopoly is shown by conduct that excludes rivals on some basis
other than efficiency, superior skill, foresight or industry.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As described above, EPS's MAC network is the only ubiquitous regional ATM network available to banks in the affected
states, and banks cannot forego access to such a network. EPS's prohibition of third party processing and other practices
prevents many banks from using competing regional ATM networks, and results in the exclusion of those networks. EPS's
conduct therefore constitutes unlawful monopolization.

Explanation of the Proposed Final Judgments
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposed Final Judgment will end unlawful practices that substantially reduce competition in the markets for
regional ATM network access and ATM processing. The injunctions of the proposed Final Judgment do so by removing substantial
barriers to the entry of competition in the affected states. Removal of these barriers is the most effective means
of providing current and future MAC member banks with additional options for the purchase of these services.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
These practices are enjoined, and these barriers are removed, by the injunctions of Section IV of the proposed Final
Judgment, which require EPS to terminate its restrictions on the use of third party processors by MAC members, to ensure
that qualified third party processors can obtain access to the MAC network, and to enable MAC members to join other
regional ATM networks.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Paragraphs A through D of Section IV require EPS to terminate its restrictions on the use of third party processors
by MAC members. EPS is enjoined from requiring its members to purchase ATM processing from MAC, from forbidding the
use of third party processors, from conditioning the price or other terms of MAC membership on the use or non-use of
third party processors, and from restricting the ability of MAC members to obtain third party processing. EPA is also
enjoined from charging any additional fees to MAC members for the use of third party processors.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

</FOOTNAME>
<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposed Final Judgment permits EPS to charge an hourly fee for reasonably necessary work performed by its personnel
in connection with a bank becoming the customer of a third party processor. The total charge may not exceed $1000 unless
significant difficulties arise at the processor's or bank customer's end.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
</FOOTNOTE>

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Paragrahs E and F of Section IV ensure that qualified third party processors will be able to access the MAC network in
order to forward network transactions of their MAC member customers. To ensure that qualified third party processors
will obtain adequate communications links to MAC, the links provided to third party processors must be provided on
the same terms as the links MAC provides to its intercept processor customers.
<FOOTCITE>8</FOOTCITE>
 So that qualified third party processors can operate in the most efficient manner, EPS must, to the extent feasible,
permit transactions from multiple banks to pass over a single communications link rather than requiring a separate
link for each bank. Except under specified circumstances where immediate termination would be appropriate, EPS
may not terminate a third party processor without providing 30 days notice, and it must provide a copy of the notice
to the United States. This will give the United States an opportunity to examine the competitive consequences of any
such termination.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

</FOOTNAME>
<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->
As explained in Section II.A.2 of this Competitive Impact Statement, intercept processors are generally the larger
banks and therefore those that have the largest ATM transaction volumes. Accordingly, they provide the most revenue
per bank to EPS, giving EPS a strong incentive to provide them adequate services, including communications links.
Because EPS has an incentive to deal fairly with its intercept processor customers, several provisions of the decree
concerning treatment by EPS of third party processors (and MAC members that use third party processors) are tied to
EPS's treatment of intercept processors in similar circumstances. By using the treatment of intercept processors
as a benchmark, the proposed Final Judgment avoids a detailed regulatory approach to these issues.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
</FOOTNOTE>

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
To allow EPS to ensure the quality of the MAC network, the proposed Final Judgment requires EPS to provide MAC network
access only to qualified third party processors. As with the quality of communications links, the standards for qualification
of third party processors are tied to MAC's qualification standards for intercept processors. A third party processor
is qualified if it meets MAC's technical, financial and operating criteria for intercept processors and third party
processors providing services to only one bank, and whatever additional technical criteria concerning the format
and content of transmissions are appropriate for third party processors processing for multiple banks. These criteria
may not discriminate between intercept and third party processors, nor may EPS charge additional fees to third party
processors for certification.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->
As discussed in footnote 7, EPS may charge a one-time fee for reasonably necessary work it performs when a third party
processor adds another bank. This charge, whether directed to the bank or the third party processor, may not exceed
$1000.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
</FOOTNOTE>

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Paragraph G of Section IV prevents EPS from discriminating in the price of ATM network access against MAC members that
choose to utilize third party processors. The volume discounts available to members using third party processors
must be the same as the volume discounts available to intercept processors. Also, EPS must use a single price schedule
for banks in Pennsylvania, New Jersey and Delaware, the areas in which the MAC network has historically had the greatest
monopoly power, and in which two of its principal owners (CoreStates and PNC) are located. By drawing this larger area,
EPS may not favor its own stockholders in Pennsylvania without giving similar volume discounts to large banks in New
Jersey and Delaware. EPS may use different price schedules in other states.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The preceding injunctions will remove the restrictions EPS has imposed on MAC member banks in their choice of ATM processors,
and thereby break the unlawful tie EPS has established between purchase of MAC ATM network services and purchase of
ATM processing. The direct consequence will be to make the purchase of third party processing a realistic option for
MAC members. This should bring about the entry of competitors to MAC for ATM processing. As discussed in Section II.A.3
of this Competitive Impact Statement, third party processors often have links to many regional ATM networks, and
so use of a third party processor by a bank can facilitate its joining of multiple ATM networks. Therefore, an indirect
consequence of breaking the unlawful tie between MAC ATM network services and processing services will likely be
an increase in competition in the markets for regional ATM network access in the affected states.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
To ensure that competition for ATM network services is in fact enhanced, Paragraph H of Section IV of the proposed Final
Judgment enjoins EPS from restricting the ability of MAC members to access other networks through their own facilities
or those of third party processors. While MAC itself is not required to establish gateways to competing networks,
it may not hinder its members form joining other networks. EPS also may not condition the price or terms of MAC membership
upon not joining another network. EPS must permit MAC members to display multiple network marks on ATMs and ATM cards,
except for electronic stored value cards.
<FOOTCITE>10</FOOTCITE>
 The injunction against prohibiting multiple branding of ATMs applies in all areas where MAC operates; the injunction
against prohibiting multiple branding of ATM cards applies only in the States of Pennsylvania, New Jersey, Delaware,
Ohio and Indiana, areas in which MAC historically had monopoly power, or in which there is a dangerous probability
that MAC might soon gain monopoly power.

Permitting EPS to restrict the multiple branding of electronic stored value cards will not lessen the procompetitive
impact of the proposed Final Judgment, because the branding of ordinary ATM cards, which are by far more common, is
not restricted. EPS maintains that allowing restrictive branding of electronic stored value cards will encourage
innovation and competition in services among firms marketing such cards.

The United States believes that MAC also has monopoly power in New Hampshire and West Virginia. However, the United
States believes that the proposed Final Judgment contains sufficient guarantees to open up those States to competition
since there is substantial commerce between those States (or portions of them) and other regions in which MAC is not
a significant competitor.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Portions of the proposed Final Judgment, including the section lifting EPS restrictions on the participation of
MAC members in competing ATM networks, will take effect immediately upon entry. Paragraphs A through E of Section
IV, which lift EPS restrictions concerning the use of third party processors, will take effect in two stages. On October
1, 1994, EPS must begin the certification process for third party processors in the MAC Midwest Platform. It must allow
third party processors to complete certification in a reasonably prompt manner, after which these processors will
be able to act as third party processors for banks in MAC's midwest region. On January 1, 1995, EPS must allow certified
third party processors to act as third party processors for all banks in the MAC network, and it must begin the process
of certifying third party processors in any remaining region. The delay between entry of the proposed Final Judgment
and the effective dates of the injunctions provides EPS sufficient time to undertake the technical steps necessary
to ensure that all regions of the MAC network will be able to accommodate third party processors.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
These provisions take effect immediately in any area where banks were permitted to use third party processors as of
January 1, 1993. This prevents EPS from banning third party processing in recently acquired or soon to be acquired
networks where third party processing has not been restricted. Also, EPS may not discontinue existing arrangements
whereby MAC members use third party processors.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The United States and EPS have stipulated that the proposed Final Judgment may be entered by the Court at any time after
compliance with the APPA. The proposed Final Judgment constitutes no admission by either party as to any issue of fact
or law. Under the provisions of Section 2(e) of the APPA, entry of the proposed Final Judgment is conditioned upon a
determination by the Court that the proposed Final Judgment is in the public interest.

Alternatives to the Proposed Final Judgment
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As an alternative to the proposed Final Judgment, the United States considered litigation seeking structural relief,
including division of the MAC network. The United States rejected that alternative because the termination of MAC's
restrictive practices concerning use of third party processors and membership in multiple regional ATM networks
will effectively break the unlawful tie established by EPS between ATM network access and ATM processing. Breaking
this tie will encourage the entry of competitors in the affected states in the markets for ATM network services and
ATM processing more efficiently than division of the MAC network. In addition, division of the MAC network was likely
to involve the Court and the parties in a complex and time-consuming process of reorganizing the network, delaying
the desired improvement in competition.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The United States also recognized that such litigation would require determination of several disputed issues of
law and fact, and that there could be no assurance that the position of the United States would prevail.

the balancing of competing social and political interests affected by a proposed antitrust consent decree must be
left, in the first instance, to the discretion of the Attorney General. The court's role in protecting the public interest
is one of insuring that the government has not breached its duty to the public in consenting to the decree. The court
is required to determine not whether a particular decree is the one that will best serve society, but whether the settlement
is ``

A proposed consent decree is an agreement between the parties which is reached after exhaustive negotiations and
discussions. Parties do not hastily and thoughtlessly stipulate to a decree because, in doing so, they

waive their right to litigate the issues involved in the case and thus save themselves the time, expense, and inevitable
risk of litigation. Naturally, the agreement reached normally embodies a compromise; in exchange for the saving
of cost and the elimination of risk, the parties each give up something they might have won had they proceeded with the
litigation.

The proposed consent decree, therefore, should not be reviewed under a standard of whether it is certain to eliminate
every anticompetitive effect of a particular practice or whether it mandates certainty of free competition in the
future. Court approval of a final judgment requires a standard more flexible and less strict than the standard required
for a finding of liability. ``[A] proposed decree must be approved even if it falls short of the remedy the court would
impose on its own, as long as it falls within the range of acceptability or is `within the reaches of public interest.'

Notice is hereby given pursuant to the Antitrust Procedures and Penalties Act, 15 U.S.C. section 16 (b) through (h),
that a proposed Final Judgment, a Stipulation and a Competitive Impact Statement have been filed with the United States
District Court for the District of Columbia in

 Civil No. 94&hyph;0948.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Complaint in the case alleges that the effect of the proposed merger between the two defendants, Tele-Communications,
Inc. and Liberty Media Corporation, may be substantially to lessen competition among multichannel subscription
television providers and video programming providers.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed Final Judgment enjoins the defendants from (A) discriminating against unaffiliated video programming
offered by such providers, where the effect of such discrimination is unreasonably to restrain competition; and
(B) discriminating against unaffiliated multichannel subscription television providers in the sale or license
of video programming, where the effect of such discrimination is unreasonably to restrain competition. These injunctions
apply with respect to the conduct of organizations under the defendants' control. With interest not amounting to
control, the proposed Final Judgment enjoins defendants from seeking or supporting conduct that would violate (A)
or (B) above is engaged in directly by defendants.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Public comment on the proposed Final Judgment is invited within the statutory 60-day comment period. Such comments
and responses thereto will be published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->

Procedures and Penalties Act (15 U.S.C. 16), without further notice to any party or other proceedings, provided that
plaintiff has not withdrawn its consent, which it may do at any time before entry of the proposed Final Judgment by serving
notice on the defendants and by filing that notice with the Court;

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Plaintiff, United States of America, filed its Complaint on April 26, 1994. Plaintiff and Defendants, by their respective
attorneys, have consented to the entry of this Final Judgment without trial or adjudication of any issue of fact or
law. This Final Judgment shall not be evidence or admission by any party with respect to any issue of fact or law. Therefore,
before any testimony is taken, and without trial or adjudication of any issue of fact or law, and upon consent of the
parties, it is hereby
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Ordered, Adjudged and Decreed:

Pursuant to section 2(b) of the Antitrust Procedures and Penalties Act (``APPA or ``Tunney Act''), 15 U.S.C. 16(b)&hyph;(h),
the United States submits this Competitive Impact Statement relating to the proposed Final Judgment submitted for
entry with the consent of Tele-Communications, Inc. and Liberty Media Corp. in this civil antitrust proceeding.

Nature and Purpose of the Proceeding
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
On April 26, 1994, the United States filed a civil antitrust complaint, under section 15 of the Clayton Act, as amended,
15 U.S.C. 25, against Tele-Communications, Inc. (``TCI''), and Liberty Media Corporation (``Liberty'') (collectively
``Defendants''), alleging that the proposed merger of Defendants violates section 7 of the Clayton Act, as amended,
15 U.S.C. 18.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
TCI is the largest cable multiple systems operator (``MSO'') in the United States in terms of subscribers, and Liberty
is one of the largest MSOs. Pursuant to an agreement dated January 27, 1994, TCI and Liberty agreed to merge. Combined,
TCI and Liberty would have financial interests in cable systems accounting for more than 13 million subscribers,
or approximately one-fourth of the nation's cable subscribers. The combined firms would also have substantial financial
interests in a large number of providers of video programming to multichannel subscription television distributors.
The Complaint alleges that the effect of such combination may be substantially to lessen competition in violation
of section 7 of the Clayton Act, 15 U.S.C. 18, by:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
1. Decreasing actual and potential competition among video programming providers, because the combined TCI-Liberty
may have the increased ability and incentive to discriminate with respect to access to its cable systems, or the terms
and conditions of such access, in favor of its affiliated video programming providers and against unaffiliated video
programming providers.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. Decreasing actual and potential competition among multichannel subscription television distributors, because
the combined TCI-Liberty may have the increased ability and incentive to deny to competing multichannel subscription
television distributors access to its affiliated video programming services, or to provide such access only on unreasonable
terms.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
On April 26, 1994, the United States and Defendants filed a Stipulation by which they consented to the entry of a proposed
Final Judgment designed to eliminate the anticompetitive effects of the proposed merger. The proposed Final Judgment,
as explained more fully below, would enjoin Defendants from discriminating against unaffiliated video programmers
with respect to access to its cable systems and other multichannel subscription television distributors (``MSTDs''),
and from discriminating against other MSTDs with respect to its programming providers, where such discrimination
results in an unreasonable restraint on competition.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The United States and Defendants have stipulated that the proposed Final Judgment may be entered after compliance
with the APPA. Entry of the proposed Final Judgment will terminate this action, except that the Court will retain jurisdiction
to construe, modify and enforce the Final Judgment, and to punish violations of the Final Judgment.

Description of the parties and the proposed transaction. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
TCI is the largest cable multiple systems operator (``MSO'') in the United States, with financial and management
interests in cable systems serving more than 10.2 million subscribers. TCI also has substantial interests in direct-to-home
satellite delivery of multichannel subscription television service, with both a substantial C-band satellite
business and a partnership interest in Primestar Partners, L.P., a Ku-band satellite multichannel subscription
television service. TCI also has financial and management interests in programming services such as The Discovery
Channel, The Learning Channel, E! Entertainment Television, Request Television (pay-per-view), Home Shopping
Network Inc., QVC Network Inc., Starz, Rocky Mountain Prime Sports Network, and Turner Broadcasting Systems, Inc.
(which provides Cable News Network (CNN), Headline News, The Cartoon Network, TBS and Turner Network Television
(TNT)).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Liberty is a large cable MSO, with financial and management interests in cable systems serving 2.9 million subscribers.
Liberty also has financial and management interests in a wide range of programming services, including Black Entertainment
Television (BET), The Box, Courtroom Television Network, Encore, Starz, Family Channel, Home Shopping Network
Inc., QVC Network Inc., Prime Sports Network and more than a dozen regional sports channels.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
TCI and Liberty intend to merge pursuant to an agreement dated January 27, 1994. Together TCI and Liberty will serve
more than 13 million subscribers, or about a quarter of the nation's cable subscribers, and have financial interests
in a wide range of programming services, including a number of the most popular and widely-carried services.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Historical relationship between TCI and Liberty.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 In 1990, TCI created Liberty, a new public company, through a rights offering to TCI shareholders and moved certain
TCI assets into Liberty. According to TCI, the new company was created for two reasons. First, the company anticipated
that possible federal legislation or regulation might force such divestiture later under unfavorable circumstances;
a voluntary separation allowed TCI to retain ties to the new company. Second, in a smaller company, management would
be able to devote greater attention to maximizing the value of Liberty assets and have greater freedom to pursue growth
opportunities in the cable industry. TCI management also felt that capital and financial markets had not given appropriate
recognition to certain TCI interests and assets, particularly in the cable programming area, because they were difficult
for security analysts and others to identify, value and track; TCI hoped that, in a smaller company, the actual and
potential value of those interests and assets would be appropriately recognized.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Although Liberty was organized as a separate company, it shared stockholders and directors with TCI. Five shareholders
maintained voting control of both firms, and Bob Magness has simultaneously served as Chairman of the Board of TCI
and a director of Liberty, and John Malone has simultaneously served as President, Chief Executive Officer, and a
director of TCI and Chairman of the Board of Liberty. TCI acknowledges that the two companies have cooperated closely
since Liberty was formed, and are partners in a number of ventures.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In 1992, Congress passed the Cable Television Consumer Protection and Competition Act, Public Law No. 102&hyph;385,
106 Stat. 106 (1992) (``1992 Cable Act''), which, combined with implementing FCC regulation, established a legal
framework regarding, among other things, the number of cable subscribers a person is authorized to reach through
cable systems owned by such person, or in which such person has an attributable interest, and delineating the extent
to which multichannel video programming distributors may engage in the creation or production of video programming.
TCI claims that the cable system and programming assets of TCI and Liberty can be recombined under this regulatory
framework, and that appropriate market valuation for Liberty's assets has been achieved, thus obviating the principal
reasons for separating the companies. According to TCI the recombination will eliminate certain inefficiencies
and costs of separation, as well as eliminate confusion and conflicts that may have resulted from the separation.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
While not indifferent to the cooperative relationship between the firms and the commonality of control in five shareholders
and common managers and directors, the Department has analyzed the proposed merger as a transaction involving two
separate entities, since separate legal and fiduciary obligations exist for each of the firms that require each firm
to operate in its distinct interest.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Effects on competition.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 A multichannel subscription television distributor (``MSTD'') is an entity that provides multiple channels of
video programming to consumers on a subscription or fee basis, as differentiated from local broadcast television
stations which individually provide a single channel at no charge within their broadcast areas. MSTDs deliver programming
to consumers utilizing various methods, including cable, multichannel multipoint distribution (``MMDS''), satellite
master antenna television (``SMATV''), direct-to-home satellite, or the facilities of common carrier telephone
companies or their affiliates.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The United States filed its complaint because the effects of the proposed merger may be substantially to lessen competition
(i) among providers of video programming to MSTDs in the United States, and (ii) among MSTDs in the areas in the United
States in which TCI and Liberty control cable system.
<FOOTCITE>1</FOOTCITE>
 The merger of TCI and Liberty would result in a vertically integrated firm with (1) substantial interests in widely
distributed and popular video programming and (2) control of approximately one-quarter of the nation's cable subscribers.
Accordingly, the merged firm may have both the ability and incentive to lessen competition by discriminating against
non-affiliated programmers in terms of access to its MSTDs and by denying to competing MSTDs access to its video programming
on reasonable terms.

These product and geographic markets are appropriate markets in which to assess the possible competitive effects
of this proposed merger. Whether or not these markets will be appropriate markets in which to analyze other transactions
or conduct within the industry will, of course, depend on the particular circumstances presented in each individual
case.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
</FOOTNOTE>

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The market for multichannel subscription television distribution today is overwhelmingly dominated by local cable
systems. Cable television service is available in nearly all urban ad suburban areas in the United States as well as
many rural areas, passing more than 95% of the nation's estimated 92 million television households. Cable television
systems currently serve more than 55 million subscribers in more than 11,300 cable systems located in all 50 states,
or about 60% of households passed. Nearly all communities are served by a single cable system; fewer than 0.5% of the
more than 10,000 cable franchise areas have more than one cable system available to local cable subscribers. Today,
cable television systems face very limited competition from other types of distribution systems, including MMDS,
SMATV, and direct-to-home satellite, and may face competition in the future from video dialtone services.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
MMDS delivers programming over microwave channels received by subscribers with special antennae. There are currently
fewer than 150 MMDS systems in operation, serving an estimated 600,000 subscribers. MMDS has recently obtained regulatory
approval to deploy systems that are considered technologically superior, which may increase its availability and
attractiveness as an alternative to cable television service.

<!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
SMATV is essentially a private cable system, typically used in apartment buildings or other high-density housing.
SMATV is estimated to have fewer than 1 million subscribers.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Home satellite dishes are used to receive programming from communications satellites. More than two and one-half
million satellite dishes have been sold in the United States. C-band satellite service, which is provided by low-power
satellites, requires consumers to install satellite receiving dishes eight to twelve feet in diameter at an installed
cost of $1,500 or more. Because of its high installed cost and the size of the receiving dish required, C-band satellite
is a poor alternative to cable television service for most current or potential cable subscribers. Medium-power
Ku-band satellite service, provided by TCI and its partners in a joint venture called Primestar Partners, L.P., uses
dishes three feet in diameter and has approximately 70,000 subscribers. High-power DBS is expected to become operational
and available within a few months using a dish 18 inches in diameter, and may by virtue of its smaller dish size be more
attractive to consumers so that it ultimately may offer greater competition to cable service than the other satellite
services.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Video dialtone is a multichannel subscription television service recently authorized by Federal Communications
Commission regulation and being developed by common carrier telephone companies. Using the telephone network,
telephone companies plan to offer distribution of programming provided by third parties. As the telephone companies
improve the capabilities and capacity of their networks, they are expected to be able to offer greatly expanded channel
capacity and services such as ``video-on-demand.'' At present, there are a small number of pilot projects demonstrating
the service. Widespread development of video dialtone services in the future may present a substantial competitor
to cable systems. Common carrier telephone companies also have announced their interest in providing cable service
directly to subscribers in the event that legal restrictions on their offering such services within their operating
regions are removed.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As discussed above, both TCI and Liberty, in addition to operating cable systems, each have substantial financial
interests in video programming services provided to cable systems and other MSTDs. The merger of TCI and Liberty creates
a vertically integrated firm with substantial power both as a MSTD and as a video programming provider. TCI and Liberty
together will effectively control access to about one-fourth of cable subscribers and will be affiliated with eight
of the twenty most widely distributed cable programming services. This substantial integration is likely to increase
abilities and incentives to restrain competition in two ways. First, the merged firm could discriminate against
competitive video programmers in favor of its affiliated programmers by refusing to carry programs or by denying
similar terms or conditions thereby making it significantly more difficult for such competitive programmers to
operate profitably or to compete effectively against the merged firm's programming services. Second, the merged
firm could deny access to or discriminate in terms of access to its programming to competing MSTDs, making it more difficult
for competitive distribution systems to obtain programming necessary to compete effectively against the merged
firm's MSTDs.

Explanation of the Proposed Final Judgment
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The United States and the defendants have stipulated that the Court may enter the proposed Final Judgment after compliance
with the APPA. The stipulation provides that entry of the Final Judgment does not constitute any evidence or admission
by any party with respect to any issue of fact or law. Under the provisions of the APPA, the proposed Final Judgment may
not be entered unless the Court finds that entry is in the public interest. The Department believes that the proposed
Final Judgment provides an adequate remedy for the alleged violation and is in the public interest. The term of the
proposed Final Judgment is five (5) years. The length of this term reflects the Department's recognition that this
industry is one that has experienced major changes in MSTD technologies that are on-going, and the effects of the 1992
Cable Act and its implementing FCC regulations.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section IV(A) of the proposed Final Judgment enjoins Defendants' cable systems and other MSTDs from discriminating
against non-affiliated video programmers in the selection, terms, or conditions, where the effect of such conduct
is unreasonably to restrain competition. This provision does not create an automatic right of access for any individual
video programmer to any of Defendants' individual MSTDs, nor is it intended to inhibit good faith negotiations between
Defendants and unaffiliated programmers regarding the terms and conditions of carriage. However, where the effect
of discrimination by Defendants is to restrain competition, such conduct is prohibited. Discriminatory conduct
can take a variety of forms depending on individual circumstances, and may include, but is not limited to, discrimination
in: (i) Pricing; (ii) channel assignment; (iii) tiering or packaging of programming services; (iv) promotional
activities; and (v) signal quality.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
By section IV(B), Defendants are enjoined from refusing to sell or license, or from selling or licensing only on a discriminatory
basis, video programming in which they have an interest to any competing MSTD, where the effect of such conduct is unreasonably
to restrain competition. Differences in price or terms that are reasonably based on ordinary commercial factors,
including but not limited to the factors currently set forth in 47 CFR 76.1002(b), will not constitute prohibited
discrimination. This section therefore does not prevent defendants from engaging in good faith business negotiations
or from imposing reasonable requirements for the creditworthiness or service quality of a distributor, or from establishing
prices, terms, and conditions that reasonably reflect actual differences in the distributor's costs of providing
such video programming or economies of scale or other economic benefits reasonably attributable to the number of
subscribers served by such distributor. This provision does assure that Defendants may not refuse to license their
video programming to competing MSTDs where the effect would be to inhibit the ability of such MSTDs to compete against
Defendants.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section IV(C) extends the prohibitions set forth in sections IV (A) and (B) to prevent Defendants from seeking or supporting,
with respect to any MSTD or video programming provider in which Defendants have any financial interest but do not control,
conduct that would violate sections IV (A) or (B) if engaged in by Defendants. For example, should Defendants urge
Turner Broadcasting, Inc. to deny programming to a competing MSTD under circumstances that would result in an unreasonable
restraint on competition, such conduct by Defendants would violate this section.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
By prohibiting conduct by Defendants that might restrain competition in the provision of video programming or multichannel
subscription television distribution, the Department believes that the anticompetitive effects of the proposed
merger alleged in the Complaint will be fully remedied. In addition, by expressly including common carrier telephone
companies and their video dialtone customers in the definition of MSTDs, the proposed Final Judgment will make clear
the defendants' obligation to refrain from anticompetitive discrimination against these potential competitors.
The Department's view as to the sufficiency of this relief also rests on the existence of sections 12 and 19 of the 1992
Cable Act, and their implementing FCC regulations, as well as the judgments recently entered in

Alternatives To the Proposed Final Judgment 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The United States considered, as an alternative to the proposed Final Judgment, litigation to enjoin the merger.
The United States rejected that alternative because the relief in the proposed Final Judgment should prevent the
possible occurrence of conduct the effect of which may be substantially to lessen competition in the provision of
video programming to MSTDs in the United States or competition among MSTDs in the geographic areas in which Defendants
have cable systems. Moreover, the terms of the proposed Final Judgment are supplemented by the provisions of the 1992
Cable Act and its implementing FCC regulations, as well as the judgments in the Primestar cases. Under these circumstances,
seeking to enjoin the merger would only prevent the two firms from achieving the economic efficiencies that may result
from vertical integration and, given their history and present circumstances, eliminating the cost imposed by their
legal separation into separate firms.

1 Vein Slope (I.D. No. 36&hyph;08320) located in Schuylkill County, Pennsylvania. Due to hazardous conditions,
daily or weekly traveling of the intake air course significantly increases the fall potential. The petitioner proposes

monitor the quantity of air; and to have a certified person test for methane and the quantity of air on a weekly basis
and record the results in a record book kept on the surface and made available to all interested persons. The petitioner
asserts that the proposed alternate method would provide at least the same measure of protection as would the mandatory
standard.

Consolidation Coal Company, 1800 Washington Road, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania 15241&hyph;1421 has filed a petition
to modify the application of 30 CFR 75.364(b) (2), (4) and (c)(3) (weekly examination) to its Ireland Mine (I.D. No.
46&hyph;01438) located in Marshall County, West Virginia. Due to deteriorating roof and rib conditions in the 4 South
seals and certain air courses from the 4 South seals to the No. 2 Fan, the area cannot be traveled safely. The petitioner
proposes to change the location of air measuring stations ``C'' and ``D'' and to continue evaluating daily air measuring
stations ``A'' and ``B'' that were established in Decision and Order dated July 17, 1989, Docket No. M&hyph;88&hyph;252&hyph;C;
to post a sign in the adjacent travel entry designating the location of these measuring stations in the adjacent travel
entry; to establish an air measuring station ``F'' on the surface at Ireland Mine No. 2 Fan in lieu of air measuring stations
``C'' and ``D''; and to have a certified person monitor each air measuring station daily and record the results in a
book that would be provided at each air measuring station and on the surface and made available to all interested persons.
The petitioner asserts that the proposed alternate method would provide at least the same measure of protection as
would the mandatory standard.

(b)(1) and (b)(2) (working sections and working places) to its Buck Mountain Slope (I.D. No. 36&hyph;02053) located

section, to ensure air quality by sampling intake air during pre-shift and on-shift examinations, and to suspend
mine production when air quality fails to meet specified criteria. The petitioner asserts that the proposed alternate
method would provide at least the same measure of protection as would the mandatory standard.

with the procedures set forth in 29 CFR part 2570, subpart B (55 FR 32836, 32847, August 10, 1990). If the exemption is
granted, the restrictions of sections 406(a) and 406(b) (1) and (2) of the Act shall not apply to the purchase of certain
real property (the Property) by the Plan from Pipefitters Local 195 of the United Association of Journeymen and Apprentices
of the Plumbing and Pipefitting Industry (the Union), a party in interest with respect to the Plan, provided that the
following conditions are met: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. An independent fiduciary determines that the proposed transaction is in the best interests of the Plan; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. The fair market value of the Property is established by an appraiser unrelated to the Plan or the Union; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. The Plan pays no more than the lesser of $462,800 or the fair market value of the Property as determined at the time
of purchase; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. The purchase is a one-time transaction for cash; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
5. The Plan pays no fees or commissions in regard to the transaction.

Summary of Facts and Representations 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
1. The Plan is an apprenticeship training plan established and administered pursuant to the provisions of section
302 of the Labor Management Relations Act of 1947. As of January 31, 1994, the Plan had 580 participants and total assets
of $1,248,499. On the same date, the number of employers contributing to the Plan totaled 21. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. The Property consists of 2.74 acres of land and improvements located adjacent to property of the Union. The improvements
include three one and two-story buildings, constructed by the Union in 1968 and 1978, designed for use as classroom
and apprenticeship training facilities for the Plan and its participants. From 1968 to 1988 the Plan operated an apprenticeship
program on the Property pursuant to a lease of the Property by the Union to the Plan.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 In August 1988 the Union sold the Property to the Plan. The Plan partially financed this purchase by obtaining a loan
from the Sabine Area Pipefitters Local 195 Pension Trust Fund (Local 195 Pension Plan). The Local 195 Pension Plan,
which was later merged into the Plumbers and Pipefitters National Pension Fund, had interlocking trustees with the
Plan and the Plan made some contributions to the Local 195 Pension Plan on behalf of its participants. The loan was repaid
in June 1991.

Prohibited transaction exemption (PTE) 78&hyph;5 (43 FR 23024, May 30, 1978) permits, under certain conditions,
the leasing of real property by an apprenticeship plan from a sponsoring employee organization. The Department expresses
no opinion as to whether the above lease satisfied the conditions of PTE 78&hyph;5 nor is any relief provided herein.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In September 1990 the Department commenced an investigation of the Plan regarding the sale of the Property by the Union
to the Plan and the loan between the Plan and the Local 195 Pension Plan.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Also, an application for exemption for retroactive relief from the prohibited transaction provisions of the Act
was submitted to the Department for these transactions. In a letter in January 1992, the Department cited as reasons
for denying the exemption application, among other factors, the lack of the review and prior approval of the transactions
by an independent fiduciary. Following this exemption denial, an agreement was reached with the Department which
required that the Property be sold back by the Plan to the Union. Such sale occurred in December 1992. Since that date,
the Plan has utilized the Property as a training facility without charge from the Union. However, the applicant represents
that because of an economic downturn in the area, the Union considers it a hardship to continue this arrangement.

The above described transactions may have constituted prohibited transactions under section 406 of the Act. Such
section prohibits, in part, a sale or exchange of property between a plan and a party in interest, a use of plan assets
for the benefit of a party in interest, and the acting of a fiduciary in a plan transaction on behalf of a party whose interests
are adverse to those of the plan or its participants.

3. The applicant obtained an appraisal on the Property on January 14, 1994, from Donnie M. Jones, MAI (Jones), a real
estate appraiser located in Port Arthur, Texas. Jones represents that he is not related in any way to the Plan or the
Union. Utilizing the income, cost and sales comparison approaches to value, Jones estimated that the Property had
a fair market value of $462,800 as of the date of the appraisal. By letter dated March 1, 1994, Jones stated that he was
aware, in preparing the appraisal, that the Plan was the prospective buyer of the Property and that this knowledge
had no influence on his calculation of value. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. The Plan now proposes to purchase the Property from the Union so that the Plan itself will own the training and educational
facilities used to train journeymen and apprentices. Plan fiduciaries note that ownership of the Property will give
the Plan full control of the buildings, grounds and parking lots and will enable the Plan to make improvements to the
Property as needed. The Plan will pay no more than current fair market value for the Property, as established by an updated
independent appraisal. The purchase will be a one-time transaction for cash and the Plan will pay no fees or commissions
in regard to the purchase. The applicant represents that, after the purchase of the Property, the Plan will have more
than enough funds for operational purposes of the training program. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
5. The Plan and the Union have selected Joseph P. Connors, Sr. (Connors), an attorney with the firm of Connors Associates,
Inc. in Washington, DC to serve as independent fiduciary in regard to the proposed transaction. The applicant represents
that Connors is independent of the Plan and the Union. Connors states that he has had extensive experience working
with Taft-Hartley plans, including serving as chairman of funds of the United Mine Workers. Connors further states
that he is well aware that while acting as independent fiduciary he assumes personal liability and he must act solely
in the interest of the Plan and its participants. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Connors maintains that the proposed transaction is definitely in the best interests of the Plan. In this regard, Connors
has met with officers of the Union and trustees of the Plan and has made an inspection of the Property with Russell Allen,
the training director for the Plan. The Plan has operated an apprenticeship program utilizing the Property since
the initial time of construction in 1968. As independent fiduciary, Connors will make certain that the Plan pays no
more than fair market value for the Property and will enforce all rights of the Plan in regard to the proposed transaction.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
6. In summary, the applicant represents that the proposed transaction will satisfy the statutory criteria of section
408(a) of the Act because: (1) The purchase of the Property will give the Plan ownership of the facilities it uses for
its apprenticeship training program; (2) an independent fiduciary has determined that the proposed transaction
is in the best interests of the Plan and its participants; (3) the Plan will pay no more than fair market value for the
Property, based on an updated independent appraisal; (4) the purchase will be a one-time transaction for cash; and
(5) the Plan will pay no fees or commissions in regard to the transaction.

Summary of Facts and Representations 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
1. Hartford Life is a stock life insurance company organized under the laws of the State of Connecticut. As of December
31, 1992, Hartford Life had assets of approximately $20.8 billion and insurance in force of approximately $93.5 billion.
Hartford Life is currently rated as follows: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A.M. Best_A++; Standard &amp; Poor's_AAA; Duff &amp; Phelps_AAA; and Moody's_Aa2. Hartford Life is a wholly owned
subsidiary of Hartford Life and Accident Company, which is in turn a subsidiary of Hartford Fire Insurance Company.
Hartford Fire Insurance Company is owned by the ITT Corporation. A significant portion of Hartford Life's business
consists of writing insurance and annuity contracts, guaranteed investment contracts, and other types of funding
agreements for numerous pension plans, most of which are subject to title I of the Act. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. HIMCO, a wholly owned subsidiary of Hartford Life, is an investment management company registered as an investment
adviser under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940. As of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
March 31, 1993, HIMCO had $3.06 billion in assets under management. HIMCO manages assets in various Hartford Life
separate accounts and other portfolios. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. For many years, Hartford Life has offered various guaranteed investment contracts (GICs) for sale in the qualified
plan market. A GIC is a type of contract under which an insurance company, in exchange for a sum of money, guarantees
that it will return that sum to the contractholder on a specified maturity date, with interest at the specified rate.
In anticipation of its obligation, the insurance company invests the funds received from the contractholder primarily
in fixed-income instruments, in order to achieve a return that will enable the company to meet its guarantee at maturity.
Typically, these fixed-income investments are held in the company's general asset account, although under some
type of GIC products, the investments are held in a separate account. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. Recently, many pension fund investment managers have expressed interest in achieving an even higher degree of
security for plan investments than that afforded by conventional GICs. In response, some insurance companies have
begun to offer Synthetic GICs. Under some Synthetic GICs, instead of paying a premium to the insurance company on the
effective date of the contract, the plan places assets in a custodial bank account owned by the plan. The assets are
held in that account by the bank custodian and are managed exclusively by the insurance company or an affiliate until
the contract's maturity. If the market value of the assets in the custodial account at maturity is less than the amount
initially placed in the account plus guaranteed interest, the insurer must make the plan whole for the difference.
The assets in the account are never owned by the insurance company, however, and the plan's investment is therefore
not affected by risks to which the insurer's own assets may be subject. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
5. Hartford Life now intends to offer a Synthetic GIC product to Plans. Hartford Life's Synthetic GIC will be offered
in principal amounts of $50 million or more. Thus, Hartford Life intends to offer its Synthetic GICs only to large Plans.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
6. Essentially, the Synthetic GIC will consist of an investment management agreement under which HIMCO, acting in
a fiduciary capacity, will manage assets of a Plan placed in the custody of a bank (the Bank) selected by the Plan (with
the approval of Hartford Life). The Synthetic GICs offered by Hartford Life will differ from conventional management
agreements, however, in that Hartford Life will guarantee that the amounts placed in the bank custodial account for
management by HIMCO will be released to the Plan, with interest at a specified rate, on certain specified dates. The
Synthetic GIC will be benefit responsive in that it may be tailored to meet the Plan's predictable benefit obligations
by establishing Scheduled Account Distribution Dates (see rep. 10, below) at appropriate times. In addition, unscheduled
interim distributions, referred to as Benefit Sensitivity Advances (see rep. 22, below), will also be available
under certain circumstances. At all times, the Plan, not Hartford Life, will remain the legal owner of the account.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
7. The decision to enter into a Synthetic GIC will be made on behalf of a Plan by a Plan fiduciary who is independent of
Hartford Life and HIMCO. The applicants represent that due to the large size of the Plans involved, the independent
fiduciaries authorizing Plans to enter into the Synthetic GICs can be expected to be (or to retain) sophisticated
professional asset managers with specialized expertise in the area of GICs and similar investments. Prior to the
Plan's investment, Hartford Life will furnish the Plan's independent fiduciary full and detailed disclosure of
all features of the Synthetic GIC, including all applicable fees (see rep. 24, below) and charges (see reps. 16 and
23, below). There is no additional fee or charge for the guarantee. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
8. When a Plan enters into a Synthetic GIC with Hartford Life, an account (the Account) will be established for the Plan.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Contributions made by the Plan to the Account on the ``Account Commencement Date'' and on any subsequent dates specified
in the Synthetic GIC will be delivered to the Bank and credited to the Account. The assets in the Account will be held
in the Bank's custody and subject to management by HIMCO. Contributions placed into the Account will be invested immediately;
there will be no time lag between the time the contributions are put in the Account and the time they are invested.

<!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
9. The Synthetic GICs will not be offered on a pooled basis; in other words, a separate custodial Account will be established
for each Plan that enters into a Synthetic GIC with Hartford Life and the assets in that Account will be managed separately
from any assets subject to a Synthetic GIC with another Plan. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
10. Hartford Life's guarantee as to principal and interest under a Synthetic GIC will come into play on certain specified
dates, namely, the ``Scheduled Account Termination Date'' and any ``Scheduled Account Distribution Date(s)''
provided for prior to the Scheduled Account Termination Date. On those dates, as described in greater detail below
(see reps. 15 and 16, below), the Plan will be entitled to distributions from the Account of the ``Adjusted Book Value''
of contributions previously made to the Account. (Specific amounts will be distributed on the Scheduled Account
Distribution Date(s), if any, and the balance of the Account's Adjusted Book Value will be distributed on the Scheduled
Account Termination Date, at which time the Synthetic GIC will terminate.) Adjusted Book Value is defined as the net
asset balance of the Account derived from contributions plus interest at a specified ``Guaranteed Rate of Interest''
determined by mutual agreement between Hartford Life and the Plan, less prior withdrawals. (The Guaranteed Rate
of Interest that Hartford Life will be willing to offer under a particular Synthetic GIC will be based on yields on securities
of various durations currently available in the marketplace at the time the Synthetic GIC is executed.) In other words,
Hartford Life will guarantee that on the Scheduled Account Distribution Date(s) (if any) and on the Scheduled Account
Termination Date, distributions will be made to the Plan in amounts at least equal to contributions previously made
to the Account, plus interest at the Guaranteed Rate of Interest, with appropriate adjustments for withdrawals (i.e.,
Scheduled Account Distributions, and Benefit Sensitivity Advances as described in rep. 22, below). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
11. The applicants represent that the Guaranteed Rate of Interest for a particular Synthetic GIC will be established
by arm's-length negotiation between the Plan and Hartford Life in advance of entering into the contract, and will
be set forth in writing in the Synthetic GIC instrument. Once established, the Guaranteed Rate of Interest will not
be modified for the term of the agreement. The considerations that will be taken into account in the negotiation process
will be essentially the same as those that affect guaranteed interest rates offered under conventional GICs. Under
its Synthetic GIC, Hartford Life will be willing to offer a Guaranteed Rate of Interest that takes into account the
rate of return it believes it will be able to achieve in managing the assets in the Account, based on currently available
investments that are consistent with the investment guidelines imposed by the Plan, and with allowance for Hartford
Life's quarterly management fees (see rep. 24, below). The applicants further represent that they and the Plans will
be aware of the rates that other companies are offering for similar products. Hartford Life represents that this,
together with the Plans' ability to negotiate the investment guidelines (and thus the level of risk) applicable to
the Account, will avoid any realistic potential for abuse. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
12. HIMCO will acknowledge in writing that it will be a fiduciary of each Plan and will be subject to the Act's fiduciary
standards in managing the assets in each such Plan's Account. The general investment objectives of the Account will
be current income with stability of principal. The agreement governing each Synthetic GIC will instruct HIMCO to
manage the Account to achieve a total return over the holding period to maturity which is sufficient to produce the
Synthetic GIC's Guaranteed Rate of Interest. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
13. Each Synthetic GIC will provide investment guidelines for achieving these investment objectives. While there
will be some flexibility in the investment guidelines to allow each Synthetic GIC portfolio to be customized to meet
the unique needs of the particular Plan, the guidelines will essentially call for HIMCO to apply the same investment
techniques that Hartford Life and other life insurance companies use in investing their own general account assets
so as to meet guaranteed benefit obligations under life insurance and annuity contracts. A central feature of these
techniques is the selection of a portfolio of securities matching contractual obligations as to timing and amount.

<!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
14. Under the guidelines, the Account will be required to be primarily invested in fixed income securities, while
maintaining a level of liquidity sufficient to provide for anticipated benefit payments by investing partly in traditional
money market securities. As a means of achieving a higher guaranteed return than would be possible by investing exclusively
in fixed income and money market securities, the guidelines will allow limited and properly hedged investment in
riskier securities such as common stocks, but they will not permit direct investment in real estate. The applicants
represent that limited investment in riskier securities will benefit the Plan by allowing Hartford Life to offer
a slightly higher Guaranteed Rate of Return than would be possible if the Account supporting the Synthetic GIC were
invested exclusively in fixed income and money market investments. Any investment in employer securities (within
the meaning of section 407(d) of the Act) will be subject to guidelines established by the Plan. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
15. Distributions prior to the Scheduled Account Termination Date which are subject to Hartford Life's guarantee
as to principal and interest (Scheduled Account Distributions) will occur on Scheduled Account Distribution Dates
(see rep. 10, above) and in amounts which will be agreed upon between a Plan and Hartford Life prior to the execution
of a Synthetic GIC and will be specified in writing. On each Scheduled Account Distribution date, HIMCO will be required
to liquidate securities sufficient to meet the Scheduled Account Distribution. In most instances, the assets will
be liquidated by a sale in the open market. However, Hartford Life reserves the right to purchase the assets to be liquidated.
When it elects to do so, Hartford Life must pay the fair market value of the asset as of the close of business on the date
of the sale, determined as set forth in rep. 21, below. Hartford Life will then distribute to the Plan an amount equal
to the Adjusted Book Value of the Scheduled Account Distribution. The Adjusted Book Value of the Account will then
be reduced by the amount of the Scheduled Account Distribution. To the extent that the market value of the assets liquidated
on a Scheduled Account Distribution Date exceeds the amount of the Scheduled Account Distribution, the excess will
be retained in the Account and reinvested. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
16. On the Scheduled Account Termination Date, the Bank will distribute to Hartford Life all of the assets in the Account,
and Hartford Life will simultaneously distribute to the Plan an amount which will not be less than the aggregate Adjusted
Book Value of the Account. As noted above, (see rep. 10, above), the Adjusted Book Value will generally be equal to contributions
plus the applicable Guaranteed Rate of Interest, with adjustments for previous withdrawals. If the aggregate market
value of the assets in the Account (determined as described in rep. 21, below) exceeds their Adjusted Book Value on
the Scheduled Account Termination Date, Hartford Life will be entitled to a portion of such excess, the amount of which
will be determined as a specified percentage of the Adjusted Book Value of the Account determined by agreement between
the Plan and Hartford Life and specified in the Synthetic GIC (the Book Value Assurance Charge), and will be required
to pay the remaining balance to the Plan. The Book Value Assurance Charge will be equal to a specified percentage of
the Adjusted Book Value of the Account, but will not exceed the market value of the Account less the Adjusted Book Value
of the Account, or be less than zero. To summarize, if the proceeds of the liquidated assets exceed the sum of the Adjusted
Book Value of the Account on that date and the Book Value Assurance Charge, such remainder will be distributed to the
Plan, thus allowing the Plan to receive a rate of return which is in excess of the Guaranteed Rate of Interest. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
17. Hartford Life's guarantee will be implemented on Scheduled Account Distribution Dates and on Scheduled Account
Termination Dates in the following manner: (1) On Scheduled Account Distribution Dates, HIMCO will liquidate assets
in the Account with a fair market value equal to the Scheduled Account Distribution. The assets liquidated will be
sold either on the securities market or to Hartford Life (the asset liquidation procedure is described in detail in
rep. 18, below). The proceeds will then be distributed to the Plan; and (2) On the Scheduled Account Termination Date,
HIMCO will liquidate the remaining assets in the Account. The assets liquidated will again be sold either on the securities
market or to Hartford Life. The Adjusted Book Value of the Account will be distributed from the Account to the Plan.
To the extent that the proceeds of the assets in the Account exceed the Adjusted Book Value of the Account, Hartford
Life will be entitled to the Book Value Assurance Charge (see rep. 16, above). The balance, if any, of the proceeds of
the asset liquidation will be paid to the Plan. HIMCO will select the assets that are sold to Hartford Life (instead
of being sold on the open market) on those dates (see reps 18 and 19, below). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As a result, some of the investments in the Account may end up in Hartford Life's hands. The applicants represent that
this is an essential feature of the Synthetic GICs that will materially (and favorably) affect the Guaranteed Rate
of Interest that Hartford Life will be able to offer to a Plan. If assets trading at a discount from their face amount
on the Scheduled Account Termination Date had to be disposed of or simply distributed to the Plan from the Account on
that date, Hartford Life would be compelled to realize an immediate loss with respect to those assets in meeting its
contractual guarantee. By allowing these assets to be transferred to Hartford Life on the Scheduled Account Distribution
Dates and the Scheduled Account Termination Date, the foregoing procedures for implementing the contractual guarantees
will make it possible for Hartford Life to hold such assets to maturity or until market conditions warrant disposing
of them. This in turn will enable Hartford Life to guarantee a higher rate of return than it would otherwise be able to
guarantee.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
18. The applicants have made the following representations with respect to how securities to be sold to Hartford Life
on Scheduled Account Distribution Dates and the Scheduled Account Termination Date will be selected by HIMCO. The
applicants state that the management of assets pursuant to an agreement to provide a guaranteed return calls for the
use of complex and sophisticated management techniques to make certain that cash flows will be available when needed.
In particular, fixed-income assets must be selected with maturities and yields that will enable the insurer to match
the maturity and yield of the guaranteed return agreement. To this end, securities are purchased in the expectation
that they will be liquidated on a particular date in order to provide the cash necessary to satisfy the insurer's obligation
to the contractholder on that date. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under the terms of Hartford Life's Synthetic GIC, the assets of the Account will be managed in accordance with these
risk management techniques. There will be a specific, identifiable pool of assets that will be internally designated
from the establishment of the Account for liquidation on each Scheduled Account Distribution Date (as well as on the
Scheduled Account Termination Date, when all of the remaining assets will be liquidated). In general, the securities
designated to be disposed of on a particular date will have maturities on or relatively soon after that date. From time
to time, depending on prevailing market conditions, the assets in an Account may be ``rebalanced''_i.e., reallocated
among the Scheduled Account Distribution Dates and the Scheduled Account Termination Date. (The applicants represent
that the flexibility to reallocate the assets among the Synthetic GIC's maturity dates in the face of changing market
conditions is essential to the effective management of investment risks under a guaranteed return contract.) At
all times, however, all the assets in the Account will be designated for liquidation on a particular Scheduled Account
Distribution Date or the Scheduled Account Termination Date. The assets that will be disposed of on each Scheduled
Account Distribution Date and the Scheduled Account Termination Date will thus be those assets designated to be disposed
of on the relevant date, and in most cases, this designation will have been made at the time of acquisition. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Regardless of whether they are sold to Hartford Life or on the open market, the assets designated for disposition on
each Scheduled Account Distribution Date and the Scheduled Account Termination Date will be disposed of on the relevant
date at fair market value. The securities that will be sold to Hartford Life on the Scheduled Account Distribution
Dates and the Scheduled Account Termination Date will be selected by HIMCO from among the securities designated to
be disposed of on those dates, based on Hartford Life's needs for securities with specific cash-flow patterns and
maturities for its general account portfolio. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
19. The applicants represent that they recognize that HIMCO's ``rebalancing'' of Account securities could be viewed
as involving a conflict of interest, in that HIMCO would be in a position to deprive the Plan of any return in excess of
the Guaranteed Rate of Interest by targeting assets expected to appreciate for sale to Hartford Life on Scheduled
Account Distribution Dates.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 However, the applicants represent that there will be no realistic opportunity for abuse in the subject transactions
for the following reasons: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<FOOTNOTE>
<FOOTNAME>

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=5 f=1 -->
3
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

</FOOTNAME>
<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->
The applicants represent that this concern will not be present in connection with sales of assets to Hartford Life
on the Scheduled Account Termination Date because on that date all of the assets in the Account will be disposed of in
any event. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
</FOOTNOTE>

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(a) The likelihood that the fair market value of the assets in the Account on the Scheduled Account Termination Date
will exceed the sum of the Adjusted Book Value of the Account and the Book Value Assurance Charge will be negligible.
The securities that will be purchased for the Account will consist primarily of fixed-income securities with limited
potential for capital appreciation, and will generally be targeted to mature on or near the Scheduled Account Distribution
Dates and the Scheduled Account Termination Date. Plans will not purchase the Synthetic GIC in the expectation of
a return in excess of the Guaranteed Rate of Interest; instead, they will purchase it in order to receive a guaranteed
return with the additional security that direct ownership of the underlying assets will afford. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) Any potential for abuse will be offset by a countervailing interest on the part of Hartford Life in making certain
that the value of the Account is adequate to meet its contractual guarantee on the Scheduled Account Termination Date.
As noted above, any excess return to the Plan will be unanticipated and unlikely. Hartford Life, on the other hand,
will bear the risk that the assets in the Account will be inadequate to provide the amount guaranteed on the Scheduled
Account Termination Date. This risk will be minimized if the Account retains assets which are expected to appreciate.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) As a practical matter, abuses on a scale sufficient to materially benefit Hartford Life and adversely affect a
Plan will simply not be feasible. The need to manage the assets in the Account to achieve the Guaranteed Rate of Interest
will severely constrict HIMCO's flexibility to manipulate the assets disposed of on Scheduled Account Distribution
Dates. To systematically pick and choose those assets with a view to selling desirable assets to Hartford Life would
seriously upset the predictability of cash flows available to meet subsequent guarantees, imposing unacceptable
risks on Hartford Life that would far outweigh any potential benefit of such a scheme.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(d) The Plan will have complete records of all transactions of the Account (see rep. 25, below) and will be able to discontinue
the Synthetic GIC (see rep. 23, below) if it discovers that HIMCO has engaged in abusive conduct. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
20. The applicants represent that no brokerage costs will be imposed with respect to the sale of the assets in an Account
to Hartford Life or an affiliate pursuant to these provisions. With brokerage costs eliminated, the only transaction
costs that will be incurred in selling the assets in question will be the costs of recording the change in ownership
of these assets. The ability to minimize transaction costs will run to the benefit of the Plan by enabling Hartford
Life to provide a higher Guaranteed Rate of Interest to the Plan. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
21. The applicants represent that the assets in which the Account has invested (which are expected to be primarily
fixed-income securities, and to a lesser extent common stocks and other assets) will be valued as follows: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(a) In the case of a security traded on a national securities exchange which is registered under section 6 of the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934, Hartford Life will pay the closing price on the exchange on the date of the transaction; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) In the case of a security other than one traded on a national securities exchange which is registered under section
6 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, HIMCO will obtain quotations in U.S. dollars (regardless of whether the security
in question is denominated in a foreign currency) from at least three unaffiliated financial institutions that serve
as market makers for the security, and Hartford Life will pay a price equal to the highest of the three quotations. The
three quotations will be obtained on the date of the transaction (i.e., a Scheduled Account Distribution Date or the
Scheduled Account Termination Date). Each quotation will represent the bid price offered by the financial institution
in question as of the time of the quotation, which will be simultaneous with the processing of the distribution to the
Plan. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In no event will Hartford Life or HIMCO make valuations themselves. The role of Hartford Life and HIMCO in the valuation
process will be limited to ministerial functions and the selection of the independent financial institutions from
which valuations will be obtained. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
22. The Synthetic GICs will be designed to provide adequate liquidity to enable Plans to meet their benefit obligations.
Thus, a Synthetic GIC will allow for unscheduled withdrawals from the Account (Benefit Sensitivity Advances) prior
to the Scheduled Account Termination Date under certain circumstances. A Plan will be able to make Benefit Sensitivity
Advances on ten days' notice for the purpose of providing the necessary funds to meet the Plan's benefit obligations
as they fall due. A Plan fiduciary may be required by Hartford Life to furnish documentation demonstrating that the
benefit payment is in fact required under the terms of the Plan. There is no charge or fee for Benefit Sensitivity Advances.
Benefit Sensitivity Advances will consist of cash distributions from the Account. When a Benefit Sensitivity Advance
is requested, HIMCO will be required to liquidate securities in the Account on the open securities market with an aggregate
fair market value equal to the amount necessary to meet the Plan's request. The proceeds will then be distributed to
the Plan, and the amount distributed will be subtracted from the Adjusted Book Value of the Account.

23. A Plan will be allowed to discontinue its Account on 15 days' notice at any time, effective as of the last trading
day of the month, except on the Scheduled Account Termination Date or a Scheduled Account Distribution Date.

 On discontinuance, the market value of the Account will be distributed to the Plan, subject to a ``Discontinuance
Charge''. Like the Book Value Assurance Charge (see rep. 16, above), the Discontinuance Charge will be equal to a specified
percentage of the Adjusted Book Value of the Account determined by agreement between Hartford Life and the Plan and
specified in the Synthetic GIC, but will not be greater than the excess of the market value of the Account over the Adjusted
Book Value on the date of discontinuance nor less than zero.

Hartford Life determined not to provide for discontinuance of its Synthetic GIC as of a Scheduled Account Distribution
Date for administrative reasons. If discontinuance were permitted as of Scheduled Account Distribution Dates,
it would be necessary to allocate the assets liquidated on that date between the assets supporting the Scheduled Account
Distribution, with respect to which the Plan would be entitled to Adjusted Book Value, and other assets, as to which
the Plan would be entitled to fair market value. Hartford Life concluded that this would be unduly burdensome. Allowing
the Plan to discontinue the Synthetic GIC on Scheduled Account Distribution Dates seems unnecessary, since the Synthetic
GIC can be discontinued at the end of the previous month or at the end of the following month if appropriate. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
</FOOTNOTE>

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Accordingly, a Plan will be free to give notice of discontinuance of the arrangement and realize its investment return
from its Account (subject to the Discontinuance Charge) at any time up to 45 days before the Scheduled Account Termination
Date. For example, if the Plan determines that the return generated by HIMCO's investment management net of the Discontinuance
Charge is more valuable than Hartford Life's guarantee, the Plan will be able to realize that return through the discontinuance
provision. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
24. Under its Synthetic GICs, Hartford Life will be entitled to a quarterly fee based on a percentage of the average
Adjusted Book Value of the assets in the Account for the current quarter. This percentage will be established by agreement
with each Plan and will be specified in writing. Out of its quarterly fee, Hartford Life will pay HIMCO a quarterly management
fee which will also be specified in writing. No separate fee will be paid directly to HIMCO. HIMCO will have the right
to withdraw from the Account certain expenses incurred directly in the investment management of the Account. Any
such expenses withdrawn directly from the Account by HIMCO are not subtracted from the adjusted book value of the Account.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
25. Hartford Life will keep full and complete records and books of account reflecting all transactions of each Plan's
Account and will make them available on an annual basis for audit by independent certified public accountants selected
by and responsible to the Plan. Hartford Life will also furnish annual reports of the operations of the Account containing
a list of the investments of the Account to an independent fiduciary of the Plan. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
26. To summarize, the applicants represent that the Synthetic GIC is fundamentally a guaranteed investment contract.
A Plan will place specified assets in the Account, and on the Scheduled Account Distribution Dates and the Scheduled
Account Termination Date, Hartford Life will repay the Plan its principal plus interest at a guaranteed rate, in exchange
for the asset value of the Account (in cash or in kind). Thus, the fundamental nature of the Synthetic GIC is equivalent
to that of the conventional GICs which have funded employee benefit plans for many years. With the Synthetic GIC, the
Plan is afforded a higher degree of security because the assets underlying the Synthetic GIC will be held in a custodial
bank account owned by the Plan and will not become part of the insurance company's assets. In addition, the Synthetic
GIC will offer the Plan a limited opportunity to realize a return in excess of the Guaranteed Rate of Interest. This
will occur if the market value of the Account on the Scheduled Account Termination Date exceeds the sum of the Adjusted
Book Value of the Account and the Book Value Assurance Charge. The Plan will also have the option of discontinuing the
arrangement if it believes that the market value of the assets in the Account (less the Discontinuance Charge) is more
valuable than Hartford Life's guarantee. The applicants represent that it is not very likely that such an excess return
will occur, because the assets in the Account will be managed with the intention of achieving the guaranteed return.
In this regard, the applicants represent that on the Scheduled Account Termination Date, the assets will consist
primarily of fixed-income securities at or near maturity with predictable values. Nevertheless, the Plan enjoys
downside protection through Hartford Life's guarantee, and also has an opportunity to realize a return in excess
of the Guaranteed Rate of Return. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
27. In summary, the applicants represent that the proposed transactions will satisfy the criteria contained in section
408(a) of the Act for the following reasons: (a) the decision to enter into a Synthetic GIC will be made on behalf of a
Plan by a fiduciary of the Plan who is independent of Hartford Life and HIMCO, after receipt of full and detailed disclosure
of all material features of the contract, including all applicable fees and charges; (b) the guaranteed return to
the Plan cannot be modified by the proposed transactions; (c) all fees and charges imposed under the Synthetic GIC
will be reasonable; (d) each Synthetic GIC will specifically provide for determinations of the market value of the
securities by an objective means of valuation; (e) Hartford Life will maintain books and records of all transactions
which will be subject to annual audit by independent certified public accountants selected by and responsible solely
to the Plan; and (f) the Synthetic GIC will be offered only in principal amounts of $50 million or more, so that the Plan
fiduciaries can be expected to be knowledgeable, sophisticated professional asset managers.

Summary of Facts and Representations 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
1. The Original Plan is a 401(k) profit sharing plan formerly named ``Radiology Medical Group Profit Sharing Plan'',
which was established by Radiology Medical Group, Inc. (the Original Employer), a California professional corporation
engaged in the general practice of radiological medicine in San Diego, California. Effective January 1, 1990, the
Original Employer underwent a corporate reorganization, resulting in the creation of an additional professional
corporation, Radiation Medical Group, Inc. (the New Employer), to assume the radiation therapy portion of the medical
practice previously performed by the Original Employer. The employees performing the radiation therapy services
were transferred to the New Employer. The Employers are separate entities, with no common shareholders or employees.
The Original Plan was amended to change its name to its current name and to enable the New Employer to adopt the Original
Plan for its employees. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Effective January 1, 1992, the boards of directors of the Original Employer and the New Employer (together, the Employers)
determined that the Employers should maintain separate retirement plans. The New Employer continued as the sponsor
of the Original Plan, and the Original Employer adopted the New Plan as a 401(k) profit sharing plan for its employees.
The assets of both Plans are maintained under one trust, the trustee of which is the Union Bank in San Diego, California
(the Trustee), which was formerly named California First Bank. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. Among the assets in the Original Plan is the Property, a parcel of real property located at 2466 First Avenue in San
Diego, California. The Original Employer owns a medical office building and other improvements on the Property which
are maintained as the Employers' principal place of business. The Original Employer leases the Property from the
Original Plan (the Original Lease) pursuant to an individual administrative exemption granted by the Department,
Prohibited Transaction Exemption 84&hyph;175 (PTE 84&hyph;175, 49 FR 48834, December 14, 1984). Pursuant to PTE
84&hyph;175, the interests of the Original Plan under the Original Lease are represented by the Trustee. Since the
corporate reorganization, the Employers share the use of the Property, and the Original Employer continues as lessee
under the Original Lease. The Original Plan, sponsored by the New Employer, continues to hold title to the Property.
The participant accounts of employees of the Original Employer, now participating in the New Plan, constitute 57
percent of the assets of the Original Plan. The participant accounts of employees of the New Employer, now participating
in the Original Plan, constitute 43 percent of the assets of the Original Plan. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Employers have determined that each Plan should own a proportionate interest in the Property, in direct relation
to each Plan's proportionate interests in the assets of the Original Plan. Accordingly, the Employers propose to
direct the Trustee to transfer a 57 percent interest in the Property (the Interest) from the Original Plan to the New
Plan, representing the ownership interest of the New Plan participants in the Property. Additionally, the Employers
propose that the Plans lease their respective interests in the Property to the Employers pursuant to a modification
and continuation of the Original Lease in the form of two separate leases. The Employers are requesting an exemption
for such transactions under the terms and conditions described herein.

<!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
3. To effect the transfer of the Interest from the Original Plan to the New Plan, the Employers will direct the Trustee
to establish separate trusts for each of the Plans, and to transfer from the existing Original Plan trust a 57 percent
ownership interest in the Property to a new trust established exclusively for assets of the New Plan. The Original
Plan will retain the remaining 43 percent interest in the Property. The Interest will be transferred subject to the
Original Lease, and the Employers will direct the Trustee to transfer to the New Plan a 57 percent lessor's interest
in the Original Lease, while the Original Plan will continue to own a 43 percent lessor's interest in the Original Lease.
The Property had a fair market value of $1,050,000 as of December 16, 1992, according to Steven L. Bowen, MAI (Bowen),
an independent professional real estate appraiser in San Diego, California. The Employers represent that total
assets in the Original Plan were valued at $13,177,499.29 as of December 31, 1992, including account balances of all
participants in both Plans. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. It is proposed that each Employer, as lessee, will execute a separate lease with both Plans, as lessors (the New Leases),
to enable the Employers' lease of the Property from the Plans under the same terms and conditions as the Original Lease
(except for provisions relating to rental review, described below). Under each New Lease, the Plans will be co-lessors
of the Property, and each Employer will be a lessee. Based upon their proportionate uses of the Property and the improvements
thereon, the Employers have determined that the Original Employer will execute a New Lease with respect to 58 percent
of the Property, while the New Employer will execute a New Lease with respect to the remaining 42 percent, and each Employer
will be responsible for the corresponding percentage of the Property's total rent and all other expenses relating
to taxes, insurance, maintenance, and repair of the Property. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Trustee will continue to act as an independent fiduciary and will represent the interests of the Plans under the
New Leases by overseeing and enforcing the Employers' performance of lease obligations and by securing compliance
with the conditions of this exemption, if granted. The Trustee represents that at all times under the Original Lease,
the Original Employer has been in compliance with all lease terms and all conditions of PTE 84&hyph;175. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
5. The proposed New Leases are triple net leases with initial terms ending April 30, 2004, the same termination date
of the Original Lease initial term. Rent is payable monthly under the New Leases, which provide for a review of the annual
rent every two years on February 1, commencing as soon after February 1, 1994 as the Department publishes the exemption
proposed herein, if granted. Such review will be conducted by an independent, unrelated professional real estate
appraiser selected by the Trustee. Any adjustment of rent resulting from such review shall be upward only, and any
decrease in the fair market rental value of the Property shall not result in any decrease in the rent under the New Leases.
In accordance with this procedure, initial rent under the New Leases will be no less than the greater of (a) $13,750
per month, which is the current rent under the Original Lease, or (b) the fair market rental value of the Property as
determined as of the initial date of the New Leases by the appraiser selected by the Trustee. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The New Leases require the Employers to pay all repair and maintenance costs of the Property, to pay all real estate
taxes on the Property, and to carry fire, extended coverage and public liability insurance on the Property to the full
extent of the insurable value of the Property, with the Plans as the named insured. Under the New Leases, the Employers
agree to indemnify the Plans and hold the Plans harmless from all claims, demands, liens, losses and liabilities of
any nature arising from the Employers' use of the Property. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Each New Lease will provide that upon the expiration of its initial term, with the approval of the Trustee, the Employers
may extend the New Lease for up to two additional terms of five years each upon written notice to the Trustee at least
six months prior to the expiration of the initial term or the expiration of the first five-year renewal term, whichever
is applicable. Rental under such extended five-year term(s) will be payable pursuant to the same procedures required
by the New Leases during the initial term, including rental review every two years. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
6. The Trustee represents that after a review and analysis, it has approved the proposed transactions on behalf of
the participants and beneficiaries of the Plans. In this regard, the Trustee engaged the services of two independent
advisers (the Advisers) to serve in fiduciary capacities on behalf of the Plans in determining whether the retention
of a 43 percent interest in the Property by the Original Plan and the receipt of a 57 percent interest in the Property
by the New Plan are prudent investments for the Plans and in the best interests of their participants and beneficiaries.
The Advisers were also engaged to determine whether the New Leases constitute prudent investments for the Plans and
whether their terms and conditions are protective of the Plans' participants and beneficiaries.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
7. One of the Advisers is Moody, Nation and Smith (Moody), a financial consulting firm located in San Diego, which was
retained by the Trustee to make determinations as a fiduciary on behalf of the Original Plan with respect to the proposed
transactions. Moody, which represents that it is independent of and unrelated to the Employers, represents that
it undertook a complete analysis of the real estate market in which the Property is situated as part of its evaluation
of the Property and the New Leases as an investment for the Original Plan. In a written report to the Trustee, Moody concluded
that the Original Plan's 43 percent interest in the Property, and its lease to the Employers under the New Leases, will
constitute a prudent investment which features adequate protections and safeguards for the participants and beneficiaries
of the Original Plan. Moody states that it has determined that the Property provides a favorable and secure rate of
return and will remain a stable real estate investment well into the future. Moody represents that its research reveals
that the Property is located in a stable and well-established market area which fared better than other areas in San
Diego during the protracted city-wide real estate market declines between 1980 and 1990. Moody represents that other
factors involved in and supporting its recommendation included the following findings: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(A) The Original Plan's assets will remain adequately diversified, in that its interest in the Property constitutes
approximately 10.6 percent of all assets of the Original Plan's participants as of February 1994; (B) The Original
Plan's return on its investment in the Property, the rental under the New Leases, is net of real estate taxes and all
expenses related to repair, maintenance and insurance of the Property; (C) Any extension of the New Leases after the
expiration of the initial term on April 30, 2004 will require the approval of the Trustee and will be limited to no more
than two terms of five years each; (D) Rental under the New Leases will always be at least the fair market value of the
Property, due to provisions requiring periodic rental review, and rent is adjustable only upward, never reduced,
in the event of changes in the Property's fair market value as the New Leases proceed. Moody states that it determined
that the fair market rental for comparable land leases in the same market as the Property is a 10 percent annual return
on the fair market value of the subject land, and the current rental under the Original Lease, which can not be reduced
under the New Lease, provides an annual return of approximately 15 percent; (E) The provisions of the New Leases further
protect the Original Plan's investment in the Property by requiring the Employers to indemnify and hold harmless
the Plans, including costs and attorneys fees, with respect to all claims, demands, liens, losses and liabilities
arising from the lessees' use and occupancy of the Property; and (F) The interests of the Original Plan under the New
Leases will continue to be represented and protected by the Trustee, an independent fiduciary which will monitor
and enforce the Employers' performance of obligations under the New Leases. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Moody also represents that it has analyzed the proposed transactions in the context of other alternatives available
to the Original Plan with respect to its interest in the Property. Moody states that alternative investments returning
a comparable rate are not available to the Original Plan in the marketplace without a material attendant risk or large
losses of principal. Moody represents that market conditions are unfavorable for any attempt to sell the Property,
and additionally, that it would be disadvantageous for the Original Plan to accept cash in lieu of its undivided 43
percent ownership interest in the Property, because the alternative investments available will provide significantly
lower returns than those provided by the Property and the New Leases. Moody states that its market research demonstrates
that the area in which the Property is situated will continue to experience stability and attractiveness to both tenants
and owners, due to the proximity to major medical and commercial centers and the lack of vacant land for new developments.
Moody contends that these conditions present a realistic potential for increases in the rent under the New Leases
over the next ten years.

8. The other Adviser is Ernst &amp; Young (E&amp;Y) a financial consulting firm located in San Diego, which was retained
by the Trustee to make determinations as a fiduciary on behalf of the New Plan with respect to the proposed transactions.
E&amp;Y represents that it is independent of and unrelated to the Employers, and that it undertook a thorough evaluation
of the proposed transactions which included an investigation of the decline in commercial real property values in
San Diego over the past several years, an overview of current and historical market conditions specific to medical
office properties, an overview of the currently local economy and real estate market conditions, and an evaluation
of the Property's rate of return and long term potential. In a written report to the Trustee, E&amp;Y concluded that
the New Plan's receipt of a 57 percent interest in the Property, and its lease to the Employers under the New Leases,
will constitute a prudent investment which features adequate protections and safeguards for the participants and
beneficiaries of the New Plan. E&amp;Y states that it determined that the Property offers the Plan a secure rate of
return above market rates, with a likelihood of continuing stability well into the future. E&amp;Y represents that
through market research it has determined that the Property is located in a market area which has achieved stability
after the declines in San Diego real estate markets during the 1980's. E&amp;Y states that the Property has good long-term
potential as a plan investment and that the New Leases provide a protected, favorable rate of return on the investment
in the Property. E&amp;Y represents that factors involved in and supporting its recommendation included the following
findings: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(A) Rental under the New Leases will always be no less than the Property's fair market rental value, as determined every
two years, and may not be decreased, so that the rate of return of approximately 15 percent is assured and is substantially
higher than the prevailing market rate of approximately 10 percent; (B) The New Plan is protected by the Employers'
indemnification of the Plans for all claims, demands, and liabilities arising from the Employers' occupancy of the
Property; (C) The triple net provisions of the New Leases will protect the New Plan's return on the Property from all
costs and expenses associated with the Property; and (D) The interests of the New Plan under the New Leases will continue
to be represented and protected by the Trustee, an independent fiduciary which will monitor and enforce the Employers'
performance of obligations under the New Leases. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
E&amp;Y also represents that it determined that the New Plan's 57 percent interest in the Property constituted approximately
6.25 percent of the value of all assets held by the New Plan as of February 1994, and that this low composition of real
estate investments minimizes risk to the Plan's investment portfolio. E&amp;Y represents that its evaluation of
the proposed transactions also included consideration of alternatives available to the New Plan with respect to
its interest in the Property. E&amp;Y states that the investments that would be available for the New Plan's investment
of cash, in the amount of and in lieu of its interest in the Property, would provide returns significantly reduced from
the return offered by the Property. E&amp;Y also states that any prospective sale of the Property would be unlikely
to generate cash equal to the fair market value of the Property, due to the costs involved and the lengthy, aggressive
marketing required by current economic conditions. E&amp;Y concludes its report with its finding that its ``de novo''
analysis of the proposed transactions indicates that it is in the best interests and protective of the New Plan's participants
and beneficiaries to accept the interest in the Property and proceed with the New Leases of the Property to the Employers.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
9. In summary, the applicants represent that the proposed transactions satisfy the criteria of section 408(a) of
the Act for the following reasons: (1) The transactions enable the participants of both Plans to continue to share
interests in the Property and its lease to the Employers pursuant to the New Leases, under the same material terms and
conditions of the Original Lease; (2) The interests of the Plans will be represented under the New Leases by the Trustee,
an independent fiduciary which has represented the Original Plan under the Original Lease and which will continue
to monitor performance of the terms and conditions of the New Leases on behalf of the Plans; (3) The New Leases, under
which rent may not be reduced, will provide a favorable return, net of all costs and expenses, of no less than the Property's
fair market rental value; (4) The New Leases, with initial terms expiring April 30, 2004, may be renewed only with the

Summary of Facts and Representations 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
1. In 1991, a pension plan (the Pension Plan) sponsored by the Employer was terminated, and a form 5310 (Application
for Determination upon Termination) was filed with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS), and a favorable IRS determination
was received. At that time the assets of the Pension Plan were merged into the Plan, including the 1/2 interest in the
property located at 1831 West Clinch Avenue, Knoxville, Tennessee (the Clinch Property). The Plan is a profit sharing
plan, currently with 16 participants. As of February 18, 1994, the Plan had total assets of $3,716,331. The Employer
is a Tennessee subchapter ``C'' corporation engaged in the practice of medicine. The owners and officers of the Employer
are the following doctors: Dr. Richard A. Brinner, Dr. Randal O. Graham, Dr. Hugh C. Hyatt, Dr. Michael D. Kropilak
and Dr. P. Kevin Zirkle. The Trust Company of Knoxville is the trustee and the named fiduciary for the Plan. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. The Employer was granted an individual exemption by the Department in 1982 (PTE 82&hyph;162), for the Plan and the
Pension Plan to purchase (the Past Purchase) the Clinch Property from a certain partnership which was a party in interest
with respect to the Plans, and for a subsequent lease (the Past Lease) of the Clinch Property by the Plans to the Employer.
The Past Lease was for a term of five years with an option to renew for an additional five years. PTE 82&hyph;162 also
required an annual appraisal of the Clinch Property, and for the rentals to be adjusted to reflect the fair market rental
value of the Clinch Property. Valley Fidelity Bank and Trust Company (Valley Bank) of Knoxville, Tennessee was the
independent fiduciary which monitored the Past Purchase and the Past Lease for the Plans. PTE 82&hyph;162 also provided
for an Employer guarantee that if the Clinch Property was ever sold during the initial five year term of the Lease and
the five year renewal of the Lease for below the original purchase price, the Employer would indemnify the Plans for
the difference between the original purchase price of the Property and the selling price.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
3. In 1988 Valley Bank was replaced by a new independent fiduciary, the Trust Company of Knoxville (the Trust Company).
Also, in July, 1988, significant improvements of a capital nature were made to the Clinch Property. The applicant
represented that these improvements cost approximately $102,685.76, and were paid for by the Plan.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
5
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The applicant also represented that immediately after the improvements were installed, the Clinch Property was
appraised. The appraisal did not result in an increase in value of the Clinch Property, and therefore, in accordance
with the Past Lease, no rental increase was made. Nevertheless, it is represented that the Trust Company demanded
an increase in rent from the Employer, in order to amortize the expenses sustained by the Plan. A rental increase of
$2,000 per month was agreed to in May, 1989, and by letter of agreement dated June 9, 1989, between the Trust Company
and the Employer, a new rental rate was set for the next five years until May, 1994.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 This modification of the Past Lease by the applicant caused the Past Lease to extend beyond the original ten (10) year
term specified under PTE 82&hyph;162. Under PTE 82&hyph;162, the Past Lease was to expire October 15, 1992.

The above-referenced changes to the Past Lease were outside the scope of exemptive relief provided by PTE 82&hyph;162,
and, as a result, as of June 9, 1989, that exemption was no longer effective. In this regard, the applicant has agreed
to file forms 5330 with the Internal Revenue Service and pay the appropriate excise taxes for the period beginning
June 9, 1989, to the date when this proposed exemption, if granted, is published in the

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
4. The applicant now proposes the following transactions. Initially, the Plan desires to swap (the Swap) the Clinch
Property, currently appraised at $425,000, for a certain condominium (the Condominium), projected to have a fair
market value of $750,000, once it is completed.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
8
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Condominium is Unit 501 in the Professional Office Building III located at 501 Nineteenth Street, Knoxville,
Tennessee. Neither the Clinch Property nor the Condominium are encumbered by debt. The Swap will be an even exchange
and will not involve any cash payments or other consideration by the involved parties. The Condominium will represent
approximately 20% of the Plan's total assets. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

</FOOTNAME>
<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->
In this regard, it is represented that all interior construction and remodeling of the Condominium will be done by
the Employer as the lessee, and will be in accordance with the Lease and the Condominium documents. The applicant further
represents that the Condominium documents provide a certain allowance for this purpose, and that any overhead will
be paid for by the Employer. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
</FOOTNOTE>

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
5. The Plan will be acquiring the Condominium from Fort Sanders Medical Center (the Center), formerly known as Fort
Sanders Presbyterian Hospital (the Hospital). The applicant represented that the Center is not a related party with
respect to the Plan and the Employer.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
9
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 It is represented that the Center is desirous of proceeding with the Swap primarily because it owns all the properties
surrounding it with the exception of the Clinch Property. It is further represented that the Clinch Property is more
valuable to the Center for its raw land than to another party as a free standing building. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->
In this regard, the applicant stated that Dr. Hugh C. Hyatt, one of the owners of the Employer, was Chief of Staff at the
Hospital in 1990, and that the doctors of the Employer also have staff privileges at the Center. Otherwise, there is
no relationship between the Employer and the Center, which is the developer of the Condominium. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
</FOOTNOTE>

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
6. The Clinch Property and the Condominium were appraised by Richard E. Wallace, MAI, SRA (Mr. Wallace), an independent
qualified appraiser. The Clinch Property was appraised by 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Mr. Wallace (the Appraisal) on November 4, 1991, at a fair market value of $425,000. The Clinch Property is located
at the northeast corner of Clinch Avenue and 19th Street in Knoxville, Tennessee. The Clinch Property is a one story
masonry office building with a finished basement. Mr. Wallace maintains that properties similar to the Clinch Property
are most often bought and sold based on their income producing ability, and, as such, he gives the income approach the
most emphasis. The income approach as it is utilized herein is based on market derived income and expense estimates
as well as general investor demands for this type of an investment. On June 30, 1993, in an update to the Appraisal, Mr.
Wallace restated his opinion that the Clinch Property has a fair market value of $425,000. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
7. On July 2, 1992, Mr. Wallace also determined the fair market value of the Condominium. Because the Condominium office
space was unfinished, Mr. Wallace prepared a consultation report (the Report), rather than an appraisal. Mr. Wallace
represents that a fully documented appraisal would yield the same value as a consultation report that was prepared.
In determining the fair market value of the Condominium, Mr. Wallace considered sales of other medical condominiums
in Knoxville. In the Report, Mr. Wallace determined that as of July 2, 1992, the fair market value of the Condominium,
which consists of 6,000 square feet, was $125 per square foot for finished space. On June 30, 1993, in an update to the
Report, Mr. Wallace estimated the fair market value of the Condominium to be $750,000. In establishing the fair rental
value of the Condominium, Mr. Wallace examined rentals of medical facilities in the Knoxville area, and determined
that as of July 2, 1992, the fair market rental rate for the Condominium is estimated at $12.50 per square foot for a triple
net lease, increasing at 3% annually. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
8. Once the Plan acquires the Condominium from the Center, it is proposed that the Plan lease (the Lease) the Condominium
to the Employer. The Lease will be a triple net lease and will be net of maintenance, repairs, insurance, taxes, utilities
and condominium fees. The Lease will have a term of three years, with two renewal options (Renewal) of three years each.
Renewals will occur upon the Employer, as the Lessee, notifying the Plan, as the Lessor, in writing at least 60 days
before the end of the expiring term. The rental rate will be determined by an independent qualified appraiser at each
Renewal. In this regard, Mr. Wallace determined the rental rate for the Condominium as of July 2, 1992, to be $12.50
per square foot. The rental rate will be $75,000 per year for the first year, payable in equal monthly installments
of $6,250 per month. For the second year, the rental rate will be $77,250 per year payable at the rate of $6,437.50 per
month, and for the third year the rental rate will be $79,567.50 per year, payable at the rate of $6,630.63 per month.
The Employer will obtain a fire and hazard/casualty insurance policy for the Condominium. The Plan as the Lessee will
be the beneficiary and loss payee with respect to the hazard and liability insurance on the Condominium. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
9. The Employer has also represented that if the Condominium is sold during the initial term of the Lease plus the two
Renewal terms for less than $425,000 (the fair market value of the Clinch Property), the Employer will indemnify the
Plan for the difference between the price received by the Plan and $425,000 (the Indemnity Agreement), in cash within
six months after notice and verification of sale. It is represented that if it is contemplated that the Condominium
be sold to a party in interest with respect to the Plan, as defined by section 3(14) of the Act, the applicant will seek
exemptive relief from the Department prior to the consummation of the sale.

<!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In addition to the Indemnity Agreement, in the event the Employer defaults on the Lease, the principals of the Employer
(the Principals) have guaranteed (the Guarantee) the rental payments to the Plan for the duration of the Lease, including
the Renewals. It is represented that as of September 2, 1993, the Principals had minimum net worth of approximately
$2,600,000. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
10. The independent fiduciary for the Swap, the Lease, the Indemnity Agreement and the Guarantee will be Earl W. Johnson
(Mr. Johnson), a certified public accountant and an executive vice president over tax and financial planning with
Lawhorn Johnson and Company, P.C. Mr. Johnson represents that he is independent of all parties to these transactions,
and that he had no prior professional or personal association with any of the parties. Mr. Johnson also maintains that
the fees received by him for serving in the independent fiduciary capacity in these transactions, combined with any
other fees derived from the Employer or related parties will not exceed 1% of his annual income for each fiscal year
that he continues to serve in the independent fiduciary capacity with respect to the transactions described herein.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
11. Mr. Johnson states that he is qualified to serve in the independent fiduciary capacity for the Plan because of his
professional experience which includes providing administrative services to qualified retirement plans, and
handling real estate transactions. Specifically, with respect to his clients, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Mr. Johnson has prepared retirement plan calculations, made investment projections and reviewed investment alternatives.
Mr. Johnson has also reviewed audits of retirement plans. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
12. Mr. Johnson represents that he has consulted with legal counsel regarding his ERISA fiduciary responsibilities
and accepts and acknowledges these responsibilities as they relate to the proposed Plan transactions. Mr. Johnson
also maintains that he has knowledge of ERISA and understands the fiduciary responsibilities under the law associated
with qualified retirement plans. In his capacity as the independent fiduciary, he reviewed the Plan's assets with
respect to the Swap and the Lease, and concluded that the Swap offers a significant premium to the Plan, and is in the
best interest of the Plan participants. Mr. Johnson also states that the Lease offers a fair rental value to the Plan.
According to Mr. Johnson, under the Lease terms, the Plan has the option to renew the Lease pursuant to the two Renewal
options. As required by the Lease, the Condominium will be appraised every time that the Lease is renewed. Mr. Johnson
represents that the Condominium will be appraised at the time it is finished and the Swap is completed. He further represents
that as an additional safeguard the Condominium will also be appraised annually by an independent qualified appraiser.
With respect to the Indemnity Agreement, Mr. Johnson represents that the Principals of the Employer have sufficient
financial net worth to indemnify the Plan. Also, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Mr. Johnson states that the Guarantee by the Principals of the Lease payments to the Plan during the initial Lease and
the Renewal periods, is additional security for the Plan. As such, Mr. Johnson represents that the Swap and the Lease
are also protective of the Plan and administratively feasible. The Condominium will be considered part of the fixed
income portion of the Plan's portfolio, and when the value of the Condominium increases, there will be an offsetting
reduction in existing fixed assets to maintain the proper asset allocation. The remaining Plan assets are represented
by stocks and bonds. There are participant loans in the Plan, but these loans represent a very small percentage of the
Plan's assets. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
13. Mr. Johnson represents that the proposed transactions are administratively feasible, in the interest and protective
of the Plan. Mr. Johnson states that the Swap is in the best interest and protective of the Plan because the Condominium
has been appraised by an independent qualified appraiser at $750,000, and the acquisition of the Condominium will
result in a significant premium to the Plan. Subsequently, the Plan will lease the Condominium to the Employer. The
fair market value of the Condominium represents approximately 20% of the Plan's total assets. Mr. Johnson will monitor
the Lease throughout its initial term of three years and during the two year Renewal terms. The Condominium will be
appraised annually and at every Renewal, and the fair market rental will be determined by an independent qualified
appraiser at each Renewal. The annual rental amounts will never be below $75,000, which is the annual rental amount
for the initial year of the Lease. Furthermore, the rental payments have been personally guaranteed by the Principals
for the initial term of the Lease plus the two Renewal terms. The Principals have also indemnified the Plan in the event
that the Condominium is sold for an amount less than $425,000 during the initial term of the Lease and during the two
Renewal terms. The Plan will incur no expenses as a result of the proposed transactions described herein. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
14. In summary, the applicant represents that the transaction satisfies the statutory criteria of section 408(a)
of the Act and section 4975(c)(2) of the Code because: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) All terms and conditions of the Swap, the Lease, the Indemnity Agreement and the Guarantee are at least as favorable
to the Plan as those the Plan could obtain in an arm's-length transaction with an unrelated party; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) The fair market value of the Condominium will be determined by an independent qualified appraiser at the time the
Swap transaction is consummated; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) With respect to the Lease, the Rental Amount has been determined by an independent qualified appraiser, and will
never be below $75,000, which is the fair market rental amount for the initial year of the Lease; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) The Condominium will be appraised by an independent qualified appraiser each time that the Renewal option on the
Lease is exercised; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5) The fair market value of the Condominium will at no time exceed 25% of the Plan's total assets; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(6) The Lease is a triple net lease under which the Employer is obligated for all costs of maintenance and repair, and
all taxes, insurance, utilities and condominium fees related to the Condominium;

The attention of interested persons is directed to the following: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) The fact that a transaction is the subject of an exemption under section 408(a) of the Act and/or section 4975(c)(2)
of the Code does not relieve a fiduciary or other party in interest of disqualified person from certain other provisions
of the Act and/or the Code, including any prohibited transaction provisions to which the exemption does not apply
and the general fiduciary responsibility provisions of section 404 of the Act, which among other things require a
fiduciary to discharge his duties respecting the plan solely in the interest of the participants and beneficiaries
of the plan and in a prudent fashion in accordance with section 404(a)(1)(b) of the act; nor does it affect the requirement
of section 401(a) of the Code that the plan must operate for the exclusive benefit of the employees of the employer maintaining
the plan and their beneficiaries; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Before an exemption may be granted under section 408(a) of the Act and/or section 4975(c)(2) of the Code, the Department
must find that the exemption is administratively feasible, in the interests of the plan and of its participants and
beneficiaries and protective of the rights of participants and beneficiaries of the plan; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) The proposed exemptions, if granted, will be supplemental to, and not in derogation of, any other provisions of
the Act and/or the Code, including statutory or administrative exemptions and transitional rules. Furthermore,
the fact that a transaction is subject to an administrative or statutory exemption is not dispositive of whether the
transaction is in fact a prohibited transaction; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) The proposed exemptions, if granted, will be subject to the express condition that the material facts and representations
contained in each application are true and complete and accurately describe all material terms of the transaction
which is the subject of the exemption. In the case of continuing exemption transactions, if any of the material facts
or representations described in the application change after the exemption is granted, the exemption will cease
to apply as of the date of such change. In the event of any such change, application for a new exemption may be made to the
Department.

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 This document contains exemptions issued by the Department of Labor (the Department) from certain of the prohibited
transaction restrictions of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (the Act) and/or the Internal Revenue
Code of 1986 (the Code). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Notices were published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 of the pendency before the Department of proposals to grant such exemptions. The notices set forth a summary of facts
and representations contained in each application for exemption and referred interested persons to the respective
applications for a complete statement of the facts and representations. The applications have been available for
public inspection at the Department in Washington, DC. The notices also invited interested persons to submit comments
on the requested exemptions to the Department. In addition the notices stated that any interested person might submit
a written request that a public 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
hearing be held (where appropriate). The applicants have represented that they have complied with the requirements
of the notification to interested persons. No public comments and no requests for a hearing, unless otherwise stated,
were received by the Department. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The notices of proposed exemption were issued and the exemptions are being granted solely by the Department because,
effective December 31, 1978, section 102 of Reorganization Plan No. 4 of 1978 (43 FR 47713, October 17, 1978) transferred
the authority of the Secretary of the Treasury to issue exemptions of the type proposed to the Secretary of Labor.

The attention of interested persons is directed to the following: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) The fact that a transaction is the subject of an exemption under section 408(a) of the Act and/or section 4975(c)(2)
of the Code does not relieve a fiduciary or other party in interest or disqualified person from certain other provisions
to which the exemptions does not apply and the general fiduciary responsibility provisions of section 404 of the Act,
which among other things require a fiduciary to discharge his duties respecting the plan solely in the interest of
the participants and beneficiaries of the plan and in a prudent fashion in accordance with section 404(a)(1)(B) of

(2) These exemptions are supplemental to and not in derogation of, any other provisions of the Act and/or the Code,
including statutory or administrative exemptions and transactional rules. Furthermore, the fact that a transaction
is subject to an administrative or statutory exemption is not dispositive of whether the transaction is in fact a prohibited
transaction; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) The availability of these exemptions is subject to the express condition that the material facts and representations
contained in each application are true and complete and accurately describe all material terms of the transaction
which is the subject of the exemption. In the case of continuing exemption transactions, if any of the material facts
or representations described in the application change after the exemption is granted, the exemption will cease

The proposed meetings are for the purpose of panel review, discussion, evaluation and recommendation on applications
for financial assistance under the National Foundation on the Arts the Humanities Act of 1965, as amended, including
disucssion of information given in confidence to the agency by the grant applicants. Because the proposed meetings
will consider information that is likely to disclose: (1) Trade secrets and commercial or financial information
obtained from a person and privileged or confidential; or (2) information of a personal nature the disclosure of which
would constitute a clearly unwarranted invasion of personal privacy, pursuant to authority granted me by the Chairman's
Delegation of Authority to Close Advisory Committee meetings, dated July 19, 1993, I have determined that these meetings
will be closed to the public pursuant to subsections (c)(4), and (6) of section 552b of Title 5, United States Code.

<DOCTITLE>Biweekly Notice; Applications and Amendments to Facility Operating Licenses Involving No Significant Hazards
Considerations </DOCTITLE>

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
I. Background 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Pursuant to Public Law 97&hyph;415, the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (the Commission or NRC staff) is publishing
this regular biweekly notice. Public Law 97&hyph;415 revised section 189 of the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as amended
(the Act), to require the Commission to publish notice of any amendments issued, or proposed to be issued, under a new
provision of section 189 of the Act. This provision grants the Commission the authority to issue and make immediately
effective any amendment to an operating license upon a determination by the Commission that such amendment involves
no significant hazards consideration, notwithstanding the pendency before the Commission of a request for a hearing
from any person. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This biweekly notice includes all notices of amendments issued, or proposed to be issued from April 18, 1994, through
April 29, 1994. The last biweekly notice was published on April 28, 1994 (59 FR 22000). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=85 g=1 f=1 -->
Notice of Consideration of Issuance of Amendments to Facility Operating Licenses, Proposed No Significant Hazards
Consideration Determination, and Opportunity for a Hearing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Commission has made a proposed determination that the following amendment requests involve no significant hazards
consideration. Under the Commission's regulations in 10 CFR 50.92, this means that operation of the facility in accordance
with the proposed amendment would not (1) involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an
accident previously evaluated; or (2) create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident
previously evaluated; or (3) involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety. The basis for this proposed determination
for each amendment request is shown below. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Commission is seeking public comments on this proposed determination. Any comments received within 30 days after
the date of publication of this notice will be considered in making any final determination. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Normally, the Commission will not issue the amendment until the expiration of the 30-day notice period. However,
should circumstances change during the notice period such that failure to act in a timely way would result, for example,
in derating or shutdown of the facility, the Commission may issue the license amendment before the expiration of the
30-day notice period, provided that its final determination is that the amendment involves no significant hazards
consideration. The final determination will consider all public and State comments received before action is taken.
Should the Commission take this action, it will publish in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 a notice of issuance and provide for opportunity for a hearing after issuance. The Commission expects that the need
to take this action will occur very infrequently. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Written comments may be submitted by mail to the Rules Review and Directives Branch, Division of Freedom of Information
and Publications Services, Office of Administration, U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission, Washington, DC 20555,
and should cite the publication date and page number of this 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 notice. Written comments may also be delivered to Room 6D22, Two White Flint North, 11555 Rockville Pike, Rockville,
Maryland from 7:30 a.m. to 4:15 p.m. Federal workdays. Copies of written comments received may be examined at the NRC
Public Document Room, the Gelman Building, 2120 L Street, NW., Washington, DC 20555. The filing of requests for a hearing
and petitions for leave to intervene is discussed below. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
By June 10, 1994, the licensee may file a request for a hearing with respect to issuance of the amendment to the subject
facility operating license and any person whose interest may be affected by this proceeding and who wishes to participate
as a party in the proceeding must file a written request for a hearing and a petition for leave to intervene. Requests
for a hearing and a petition for leave to intervene shall be filed in accordance with the Commission's ``Rules of Practice
for Domestic Licensing Proceedings'' in 10 CFR Part 2. Interested persons should consult a current copy of 10 CFR 2.714
which is available at the Commission's Public Document Room, the Gelman Building, 2120 L Street, NW., Washington,
DC 20555 and at the local public document room for the particular facility involved. If a request for a hearing or petition
for leave to intervene is filed by the above date, the Commission or an Atomic Safety and Licensing Board, designated
by the Commission or by the Chairman of the Atomic Safety and Licensing Board Panel, will rule on the request and/or
petition; and the Secretary or the designated Atomic Safety and Licensing Board will issue a notice of a hearing or
an appropriate order. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As required by 10 CFR 2.714, a petition for leave to intervene shall set forth with particularity the interest of the
petitioner in the proceeding, and how that interest may be affected by the results of the proceeding. The petition
should specifically explain the reasons why intervention should be permitted with particular reference to the following
factors: (1) The nature of the petitioner's right under the Act to be made a party to the proceeding; (2) the nature and
extent of the petitioner's property, financial, or other interest in the proceeding; and (3) the possible effect
of any order which may be entered in the proceeding on the petitioner's interest. The petition should also identify
the specific aspect(s) of the subject matter of the proceeding as to which petitioner wishes to intervene. Any person
who has filed a petition for leave to intervene or who has been admitted as a party may amend the petition without requesting
leave of the Board up to 15 days prior to the first prehearing conference scheduled in the proceeding, but such an amended
petition must satisfy the specificity requirements described above. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Not later than 15 days prior to the first prehearing conference scheduled in the proceeding, a petitioner shall file
a supplement to the petition to intervene which must include a list of the contentions which are sought to be litigated
in the matter. Each contention must consist of a specific statement of the issue of law or fact to be raised or controverted.
In addition, the petitioner shall provide a brief explanation of the bases of the contention and a concise statement
of the alleged facts or expert opinion which support the contention and on which the petitioner intends to rely in proving
the contention at the hearing. The petitioner must also provide references to those specific sources and documents
of which the petitioner is aware and on which the petitioner intends to rely to establish those facts or expert opinion.
Petitioner must provide sufficient information to show that a genuine dispute exists with the applicant on a material
issue of law or fact. Contentions shall be limited to matters within the scope of the amendment under consideration.
The contention must be one which, if proven, would entitle the petitioner to relief. A petitioner who fails to file
such a supplement which satisfies these requirements with respect to at least one contention will not be permitted
to participate as a party. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Those permitted to intervene become parties to the proceeding, subject to any limitations in the order granting leave
to intervene, and have the opportunity to participate fully in the conduct of the hearing, including the opportunity
to present evidence and cross-examine witnesses. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If a hearing is requested, the Commission will make a final determination on the issue of no significant hazards consideration.
The final determination will serve to decide when the hearing is held. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If the final determination is that the amendment request involves no significant hazards consideration, the Commission
may issue the amendment and make it immediately effective, notwithstanding the request for a hearing. Any hearing
held would take place after issuance of the amendment.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
If the final determination is that the amendment request involves a significant hazards consideration, any hearing
held would take place before the issuance of any amendment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A request for a hearing or a petition for leave to intervene must be filed with the Secretary of the Commission, U.S.
Nuclear Regulatory Commission, Washington, DC 20555, Attention: Docketing and Services Branch, or may be delivered
to the Commission's Public Document Room, the Gelman Building, 2120 L Street, NW., Washington DC 20555, by the above
date. Where petitions are filed during the last 10 days of the notice period, it is requested that the petitioner promptly
so inform the Commission by a toll-free telephone call to Western Union at 1&hyph;(800) 248&hyph;5100 (in Missouri
1&hyph;(800) 342&hyph;6700). The Western Union operator should be given Datagram Identification Number N1023
and the following message addressed to (Project Director): petitioner's name and telephone number, date petition
was mailed, plant name, and publication date and page number of this 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 notice. A copy of the petition should also be sent to the Office of the General Counsel, U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission,
Washington, DC 20555, and to the attorney for the licensee. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Nontimely filings of petitions for leave to intervene, amended petitions, supplemental petitions and/or requests
for a hearing will not be entertained absent a determination by the Commission, the presiding officer or the Atomic
Safety and Licensing Board that the petition and/or request should be granted based upon a balancing of factors specified
in 10 CFR 2.714(a)(1)(i)&hyph;(v) and 2.714(d). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For further details with respect to this action, see the application for amendment which is available for public inspection
at the Commission's Public Document Room, the Gelman Building, 2120 L Street, NW., Washington, DC 20555, and at the
local public document room for the particular facility involved.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Description of amendment request: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposed amendment would revise Technical Specification (TS) 3/4.4.9, Pressure/Temperature Limits, and its
associated Bases, by changing the Unit 1 heatup and cooldown curves to incorporate a newly determined reactor vessel
reference nil-ductility temperature, RT
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
NDT
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, and by updating the removal schedule of vessel surveillance capsules for both units in accordance with ASTM E185&hyph;82.
Changes would also be made to the Unit 1 Low Temperature Overpressure Protection System (LTOPS) setpoint curve in
TS 3.4.9.3 to reflect the new pressure/temperature limits. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee has provided its analysis of the issue of no significant hazards consideration,
which is presented below: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A. The proposed change does not involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously
evaluated. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The use of new pressure-temperature limit curves and low temperature overpressure protection curves will not change
any postulated accident scenarios. The revised curves were developed using industry standards and regulations
which are recognized as being inherently conservative. The pressure-temperature low temperature overpressure
curves provide reactor coolant system (RCS) limits to protect the reactor pressure vessel from brittle fracture
by clearly separating the region of normal operations from the region where the vessel is subject to brittle fracture.
The heatup and cooldown limits are designed to ensure that the 10 CFR 50 Appendix G Pressure Temperature limits for
the RCS are not exceeded during any condition of normal operation including anticipated operational occurrences.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
General Design Criterion 32 of 10 CFR 50 Appendix A requires that the reactor coolant boundary shall be designed with
sufficient margin to assure that when stressed under operating, maintenance, testing, and postulated accident
condition[s], (1) the boundary behaves in a nonbrittle manner and (2) the probability of rapidly propagating fracture
is minimized. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
10 CFR 50 Appendix G, ``Fracture Toughness Requirements,'' requires that the effects of changes in the fracture toughness
of reactor vessel materials caused by neutron radiation throughout the service life of [a] nuclear reactor be considered
in the pressure-temperature limits. The change is used in conjunction with the material initial reference temperature
(RT
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
NDT
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
) to establish the limiting pressure-temperature curves. Regulatory Guide 1.99, Rev. 2, contains procedures for
calculating the effects of neutron radiation embrittlement of the low-alloy steels currently used for light-water-cooled
reactor vessels. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Using the Regulatory Guide 1.99, Revision 2, Braidwood Unit 1 Surveillance Capsule U results, and Appendix G to 10
CFR 50, new Pressure-Temperature curves [were] prepared for the projected reactor vessel exposure at 32 EFPY of operation.
These new curves, in conjunction with the heatup and cooldown ranges and the revised Low-Temperature Overpressure
Protection System setpoints, provide the required assurance that the reactor pressure vessel is protected from
brittle fracture up 32 EFPY of operation. No changes to the design of the facility have been made and no new equipment
has been added or removed. The revised analysis and resultant adjustment of the operating limitations provide assurance
that the Reactor Coolant System is protected from brittle fracture. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Revising the Reactor Vessel Material Surveillance Program Withdrawal Schedule does not result in the addition or
removal of any equipment, or any design changes to the facility. Capsule lead times are revised and, for Braidwood
Unit 2, Capsule X will be removed next vice Capsule W. The proposed removal schedules remain consistent with ASTM 185&hyph;82.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Therefore, the proposed amendment to the pressure temperature limitations does not involve a significant increase
in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
B. The proposed change does not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously
evaluated.

<!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The use of the new pressure-temperature operating limits and the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
new low temperature overpressure protection curve does not change 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
any postulated accident scenarios. The new curves do not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
represent any appreciable change in the current methodologies; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
they merely provide assurance that the Reactor Coolant System is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
protected from brittle fracture. No new accident or malfunction 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
mechanism is introduced by the amendment and no physical plant 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
changes will result from this amendment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Revision of the Reactor Vessel Material Surveillance Program 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Withdrawal Schedule does not introduce a new accident or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
malfunction mechanism. Capsule lead times are revised, and, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
other than changing the order of specimen removal, consistent 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
with ASME 185&hyph;82, no physical plant changes will result from this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
revised schedule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Therefore, the proposed changes do not create the possibility of a new 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
C. The proposed change does not involve a significant reduction in a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
margin of safety. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The new pressure-temperature operating limits low temperature 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
overpressure protection curves were generated with the currently 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
accepted conservative methodology using capsule surveillance 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
data. The new pressure-temperature curves were developed using 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
industry standards and regulations (ASME Code Section III, and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
NRC Regulatory Guide 1.99, Revision 2) which are recognized as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
being inherently conservative. The use of the new pressure- 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
temperature operating limits and low temperature overpressure 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
protection limits would not change postulated accident scenarios. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed revision to the Reactor Vessel Material Surveillance 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Program Withdrawal Schedule would not change postulated accident 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
scenarios. Capsule lead times are revised, and, other than 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
changing the order of specimen removal, consistent with ASTM 185- 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
82, no physical plant changes will result from this revised 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
schedule. Therefore, the proposed changes do not involve a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
significant reduction in a margin of safety. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The NRC staff has reviewed the licensee's analysis and, based on this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
review, it appears that the three standards of 10 CFR 50.92(c) are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
satisfied. Therefore, the NRC staff proposes to determine that the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
amendment request involves no significant hazards consideration.

 The proposed amendment would change the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 As 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee has provided its analysis of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
issue of no significant hazards consideration, which is presented below: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The following evaluation is provided for the three categories of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
significant hazards consideration standards: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a. Proposed changes to allow 8 hours for master relay and logic 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
testing, 12 hours for slave relay testing and 6 hours to restore 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
an inoperable ESFAS Automatic Actuation Channel prior to entering 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the shutdown action clock. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) The determination that these changes are within all 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
acceptable criteria was established in the NRC's SER 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
prepared for WCAP&hyph;10271, Supplement 2, Revision 1. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Technical Specification changes proposed by this license 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
amendment request conform to NRC guidance contained in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
SER. The NRC found that implementation of the proposed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
changes is expected to result in a small and acceptable 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
increase in ESFAS unavailability. This increase in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
probability results in a small increase in calculated core 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
damage frequency and public risk. The calculated increase 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in core damage frequency was judged to be acceptable since 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the increase was small and well within the range of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
uncertainty associated with the analysis. The values 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
presented in WCAP&hyph;10271 Supplement 2 Revision 1 for increase 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in core damage frequency were verified by Brookhaven 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
National Laboratory as part of an audit and sensitivity 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
analyses performed for the NRC Staff. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Based on the small increase in core damage frequency as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
compared with the range of uncertainty in the analysis, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
NRC agreed that the calculated increase is acceptable. This 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
conclusion was documented in the NRC's SER dated February 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
22, 1989. The applicability of these conclusions has been 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
verified through a plant specific review of the generic 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
analysis in WCAP&hyph;10271, Supplement 2, Revision 1. The ESFAS 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Automatic Actuation Channel allowed outage and restoration 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
times included in this license amendment request are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
consistent with the generic analysis. In addition, the NRC 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
stated that the majority of the increase in unavailability 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
was due to the decrease in frequency of surveillance testing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
vice the changes in allowed outage and restoration times. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Therefore, considering the above information, the proposed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
allowed outage and restoration time changes do not involve a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
significant increase in the probability of occurrence or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
consequences of an accident previously evaluated. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) The proposed changes do not involve the physical alteration 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of any plant system and do not result in a change in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
manner in which the ESFAS system performs its function. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
increases in allowed outage and restoration times only 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
affects the probability of the ESFAS Automatic Actuation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Channel functioning properly as described above. Therefore, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the allowed outage and restoration time changes proposed in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
this license amendment request do not create a new or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
different type of accident from any previously evaluated. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) The proposed allowed outage time and restoration time 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
changes do not alter the manner in which safety limits, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
limiting safety system setpoints or limiting conditions for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
operation are determined. The impact of the revised ESFAS 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Automatic Actuation Channel allowed outage and restoration 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
times is addressed above. Implementation of the proposed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
changes is expected to result in an overall improvement in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
safety by allowing adequate time for required ESFAS testing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and quality repairs leading to improved equipment 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reliability due to a more appropriate restoration time. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Therefore, it may be concluded that the proposed allowed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
outage and restoration time changes do not involve a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
significant reduction in margin of safety. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
b. Proposed change to the minimum required degree of redundancy for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the High-High Containment Pressure channels in Table 3.4&hyph;1. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Changing the minimum required degree of redundancy in Table 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3.4&hyph;1 for the High-High Containment Pressure Channels (Table 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3.4&hyph;1 items II.3, III.B.3, and IV.3) provides consistency 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
with Technical Specification 3.4.2.c which allows an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
inoperable High-High Containment Pressure channel to be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
placed in bypass. Placement of an inoperable High-High 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Containment Pressure Channel in bypass is preferred to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reduce the probability of an inadvertent containment spray 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
event. Also, these channels are designed with a two out of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
four logic so that the failed channel may be bypassed rather 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
than tripped. With the failed channel bypassed, single 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
failure criterion is still met because the logic is now a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
two out of three. Furthermore, with the one channel 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
bypassed, a single channel failure will not inadvertently 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
initiate a containment spray. Therefore, this change can be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
considered an administrative change to correct Table 3.4&hyph;1 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to agree with the Action requirements of Technical 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Specification 3.4.2.c. As such this proposed change does 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
not involve an increase in the probability of occurrence or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
consequences of an accident previously evaluated. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Correcting the minimum required degree of redundancy in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Table 3.4&hyph;1 for the High-High Containment Pressure channels 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
is an administrative change which does not involve the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
physical alteration of any plant system and does not result 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in a change in the manner in which the ESFAS system performs 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
its function. Therefore, the proposed correction to Table 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3.4&hyph;1 does not create the possibility of a new or different 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
kind of accident from any previously analyzed. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Correcting the minimum required degree of redundancy in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Table 3.4&hyph;1 to be consistent with the Actions of Technical 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Specification 3.4.2.c is an administrative change and as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
such does not involve any reduction in a margin of safety. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
c. Proposed change to the delete footnote +++ from Table 3.4&hyph;1. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Deleting footnote +++ from Table 3.4&hyph;1 removes the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
inconsistency between it and Technical Specification 3.4.2.c 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
which states that channels other than the High-High 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Containment Pressure channels shall be placed in trip during 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
testing. The change does not affect the manner in which 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ESFAS provides plant protection. In addition the change 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
does not affect the functioning of ESFAS or the way Zion 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Station conducts channel testing. Instrument channel 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
testing will continue to be conducted in the tripped mode 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
with the exception of the High-High Containment Pressure 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
channels, which can be tested in bypass because of the risk 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of a spurious Containment Spray event. Automatic Actuation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Channel testing will be performed in accordance with the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
allowed outage times of new Specification 3.4.2.d. As such 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
this proposed change does not involve any significant 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
increase in the probability of occurrence or consequences of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
an accident previously evaluated.

(2) Deleting footnote +++ from Table 3.4&hyph;1 does not involve the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
physical alteration of any plant system and does not result 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in a change in the manner in which ESFAS performs its 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
function. Therefore this change does not involve the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
physical alteration of any plant system and does not result 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in a change in the manner in which the ESFAS system performs 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
its function. Therefore, the proposed correction to Table 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3.4&hyph;1 does not create the possibility of a new or different 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
kind of accident from any previously analyzed. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Deleting footnote +++ from Table 3.4&hyph;1 does not alter the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
manner in which safety limits, limiting safety system 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
setpoints or limiting conditions for operation are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
determined. Implementation of this change will not alter 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ESFAS testing. Therefore implementation of this change does 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
not involve any reduction in a margin of safety. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
d. Proposed editorial change to Technical Specification 3.4.2.c. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The editorial change to Technical Specification 3.4.2.c to change 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
``Containment Hi-Hi pressure channels'' to ``High-High Containment 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Pressure channels'' is purely an administrative change which has 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
no affect on plant safety. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
e. Summary. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The foregoing analyses demonstrate that the proposed License 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Amendment to the Zion Station Technical Specifications does not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
involve a significant increase in the probability of occurrence 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
or consequences of a previously evaluated accident, does not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
does not involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The NRC staff has reviewed the licensee's analysis and, based on this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

satisfied. Therefore, the NRC staff proposes to determine that the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
amendment request involves no significant hazards consideration.

Description of amendment request:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The proposed change revises the reactor 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
vessel pressure-temperature limits in the Technical Specifications. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
change insures that the vessel fracture toughness requirements of Section V 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of 10 CFR Part 50, Appendix G, are satisfied through the end of life. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 As 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee has provided its analysis of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
issue of no significant hazards consideration, which is presented below: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. Will the proposed change involve a significant increase in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the probability or consequences of an accident previously 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
evaluated? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The margin above Nil Ductility Transition Temperature (NDTT) is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
governed by 10 CFR 50 Appendix G and remains unchanged. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proposed change will not involve a significant increase in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
probability or consequences of a previously evaluated accident. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. Will the proposed change create the possibility of a new or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
different kind of accident from any accident previously 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
evaluated? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The predicted shifts in NDTT are based on a revised reference 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
temperature consistent with Regulatory Guide 1.99, Revision 2, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
dated May 1988. This method of revising temperature-pressure 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
limits is the same as in the past (ASME Code Section III, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Appendix G). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. Will the proposed change involve a significant reduction in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
margin of safety? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed curves were generated for an End of Licensed Life 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(May 31, 2000) Effective Full Power Year exposure and are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
conservative in nature until that time. The margin of safety 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
[is] unchanged. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The NRC staff has reviewed the licensee's analysis and, based on this

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 License Amendment No. 81, issued on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
July 15, 1993, changed the numbering of surveillance requirements for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Technical Specifications 3/4.3.1, ``Control Rod Operability,'' 3/4.3.2, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
``Control Rod Maximum Scram,'' and 3/4.10.2, ``Rod Pattern Control System.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
However, Action Statements referencing these surveillance requirements were 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
overlooked and were not appropriately renumbered. The purpose of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proposed technical specification change would be to renumber the overlooked 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
references. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

 As 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee has provided its analysis of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
issue of no significant hazards consideration which is presented below: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) These changes do not affect the intent or implementation of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
applicable Technical Specifications. The changes simply make the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
affected Technical Specifications consistent. Since these are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
only editorial changes which do not impact the plant design or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
operations, they cannot increase the probability or the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
consequences of any accident previously evaluated.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(2) The proposed changes are editorial only and do not affect the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
plant design or operation. No new failure modes are introduced 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
by such changes and, therefore, the request will not create the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
accident previously evaluated. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) The proposed changes merely correct an editorial oversight. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
These changes do not alter or delete any technical requirements 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and, therefore, do not involve a reduction in a margin of safety.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Test methods for carbon adsorber filters 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
specified in Technical Specification Sections 3/4.6.6.3, ``Standby Gas 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Treatment System,'' and 3/4.7.2, ``Control Room Ventilation System,'' specify 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the 1979 version of ASTM D3803. The proposed change would delete the year 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of the standard so that more recent versions of the standard could be used. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination: As 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee has provided its analysis of the issue of no significant hazards consideration
which is presented below: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) The proposed changes to the Technical Specification surveillance 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requirements for determining the methyl iodide penetration of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
carbon samples would not involve a significant increase in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
probability or the consequences of any accident previously 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
evaluated because the proposed change merely allows Illinois 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Power (IP) to utilize a more up-to-date version of the same test 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
method currently specified. More recent versions of the test 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
method are more effective at detecting unsatisfactory charcoal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
performance because they include equilibration periods to ensure 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that all samples have a common starting point before being 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
challenged with radioactive gas. The proposed change would not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
affect the quality of the charcoal or the reliability of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
filter subsystems as it only relates to testing and involves no 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
changes to the design or operation of the ventilation subsystems 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
themselves. The updated standards provide more accurate and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
repeatable test results and do not change the properties or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
acceptance criteria for these properties. As a result, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
performance capabilities of the associated filter subsystems 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
would not be adversely impacted by the proposed change. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) The proposed change would not involve a change in the design or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
operation of any plant system or component. In addition, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proposed change would not reduce the level of filter train 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
subsystem reliability nor would it create an initiating event for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
any accident. Because the performance, function, and redundancy 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of the original design remain unchanged, the proposed change 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
would not create the potential for a new event. Furthermore, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
since no new types of equipment would be introduced into the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
plant design and the proposed change would not adversely impact 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
existing equipment, no potential for a different type of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
malfunction is created by the proposed change. Therefore, this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proposed change cannot create the possibility of a new or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
different kind of accident from any accident previously 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
evaluated. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) The margin of safety for the charcoal filter subsystems as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
defined in the Bases to the Technical Specifications associated 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
with the proposed change refers to the ability of the filters to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
remove radioiodines. The proposed change would allow IP to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
upgrade the currently specified test for determining charcoal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
adsorber performance with one which utilizes the same type of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
methodology, but provides greater accuracy and repeatability. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The newer versions of the test method are more effective at 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
detecting unsatisfactory charcoal performance because they 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
include equilibration periods to ensure that all samples have a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
common starting point before being challenged with radioactive 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
gas. Thus, the proposed change would not involve a reduction in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the margin of safety.

Description of amendment request: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposed amendment would revise 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
technical specifications Tables 3.2.4 and 4.2.1, to change one of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
initiating parameters of the reactor building ventilation isolation system 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and standby gas treatment system (SGTS) from Low Reactor Water Level to Low 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Low Reactor Water Level. This revision is being made in order to improve 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
plant performance by reducing the potential for unnecessary secondary 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
containment isolation and SGTS initiations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee has provided its analysis of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
issue of no significant hazards consideration, which is presented below: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed amendment will not involve a significant increase in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The function of the Standby Gas Treatment System and secondary 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
containment is to mitigate the consequences of a loss of coolant 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
accident and fuel handling accidents. The proposed changes maintain 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
this capability. The revised Standby Gas Treatment System initiation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and secondary containment isolation parameter of low low reactor water 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
level provides the required detection of loss of coolant accidents and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
is consistent [with] ECCS actuation to mitigate the consequences of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
this accident. The low low reactor water level instrumentation is set 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to trip when reactor water level is 6'6'' above the top of the active 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
fuel. This trip currently initiates closure of the Group 1 Primary 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
containment isolation valves, activates the Emergency Core Cooling 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
systems and starts the emergency diesel generator. This trip setting 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
level was chosen to be low enough to prevent spurious operation but 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
high enough to initiate Emergency Core Cooling system operation and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
primary system isolation so that no melting of the fuel cladding will 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
occur, post accident cooling can be accomplished, and the guidelines 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of the 10 CFR 100 will not be violated. Therefore, this amendment 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
will not cause a significant increase in the probability or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
consequences of an accident previously evaluated for the Monticello 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
plant. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed amendment will not create the possibility of a new or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
different kind of accident from any accident previously analyzed. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed changes to Technical Specifications for the standby gas 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
treatment system and secondary containment do not alter the function 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
8 of the systems or its interrelationships with other systems. An 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
adverse interaction which could be postulated to occur is the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
initiation of the Standby Gas Treatment System without a coordinated 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
trip of the Mechanical Vacuum Pump. The Mechanical Vacuum Pump is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
operated during plant startups to draw a vacuum on the main condenser 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
prior to admission of steam. The Mechanical vacuum discharges to the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
offgas stack and thus can create a back pressure on the Standby Gas 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Treatment System, reducing initiation of Standby Gas Treatment System 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
flow below required values. The proposed initiation of Standby Gas 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Treatment System on low low reactor water level maintains the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
necessary coordination by having the Standby Gas Treatment System 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
initiate subsequent to isolation or tripping of the Mechanical Vacuum 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Pump on a low reactor water level signal from the primary containment 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
isolation logic. Therefore, this amendment will not create the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
previously analyzed. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed amendment will not involve a significant reduction in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
margin of safety. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed amendment changes the initiation of the Standby Gas 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Treatment System and secondary containment isolation from being 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
concurrent with the low reactor water signal (which is indicative that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the reactor core is in danger of being inadequately cooled) to being 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
concurrent with reactor low low water level (which is also an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
indicator that the capability to cool the core is threatened and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
assures that no melting of the fuel cladding will occur, post accident 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
cooling can be accomplished, and the guidelines of 10 CFR 100 will not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
be violated). A review of the accident analyses provided in Section 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
14 of the USAR has determined that these analyses did not specifically 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
credit initiation of the Standby Gas Treatment Systems and secondary 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
containment isolation at the accident precursor reactor water level of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
low level. Furthermore, this review determined that the low low 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reactor water level setpoint has no adverse impact on the ability of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the Standby Gas treatment System and secondary containment to perform 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
its design basis function as credited in the accident analyses. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The NRC staff has reviewed the licensee's analysis and, based on this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
review, it appears that the three standards of 10 CFR 50.92(c) are

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposed modification to Technical Specification (TS) Sections 3.11.1.4, 6.9.1.8, and 6.14.1 would change
the frequency for submitting the Semiannual Radioactive Effluent Release Report to the NRC from semiannually to
annually.

1. The proposed Technical Specifications (TS) changes do not involve a significant increase in the probability or

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed TS changes are administrative in nature. The proposed changes simply involve revising the frequency
for submitting the Semiannual Radioactive Effluent Release Report to the NRC from semiannually to annually in order
to implement the amended reporting requirements of 10 CFR 50.36a as promulgated in Final Rule 57 FR 39353. Since the
information contained in this report is reviewed and evaluated after the effluents are released, no accidents previously
evaluated are impacted by the proposed TS changes. Radiological effluent releases from the station will continue
to be controlled as required by the TS, including those requirements specified in the Offsite Dose Calculation Manual
(ODCM) and Process Control Program (PCP). The proposed TS changes do not involve any changes to the operation or physical
configuration of any plant systems or equipment. The proposed changes do not impact any initial or final accident
conditions or assumptions previously evaluated. The radiological consequences of these previously evaluated
accidents are not affected by the proposed changes.

Description of amendment request: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposed Technical Specification (TS) changes would delete surveillance requirement 4.8.1.4.a.3, which requires
periodic testing of penetration protection fuses, and its associated Basis.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee has provided its analysis of the issue of no significant hazards consideration,
which is presented below:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. The probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated is not significantly increased.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Fuses are simple protection devices and can only degrade by being more resistive which is in the conservative direction.
The proper type and size fuse is assured as part of design, procurement, and initial installation. The testing provides
no additional assurance of operability. Therefore, the deletion of periodic retesting of these fuses will not increase
the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. [The proposed amendment will not] [c]reate the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any previously
analyzed.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The design of the penetration protection and the installation of the fuses has not changed in any way. Any undetected
failure of a fuse would fall under single failure criteria. A current limiting fuse must have high electrical current
in order to perform its intended function. Any fuse which has opened the circuit through the penetration would be detected.
(This is not a concern of the Technical Specifications.) Therefore, this change does not create the possibility of
a new or different kind of accident from any previously evaluated.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. Involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety. Deletion of this surveillance requirement will not minimize
the intent of this Technical Specification. This TS is to assure continued operability of the containment penetration
conductor overcurrent protection which helps to ensure containment integrity. Testing, however, may introduce
the potential for damage to the fuses and fuse clips. Therefore, the deletion of this TS requirement will not involve
a significant reduction in a margin of safety.

Description of amendment request: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposed amendment would result in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the replacement of most of the analog Riley temperature instrumentation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
associated with leak detection with digital equipment from the General 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Electric Company NUMAC product line. Technical Specification changes would 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
be made to instrumentation surveillance requirements for temperature 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
instruments associated with main steam line isolation, reactor water 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
cleanup system isolation, reactor core isolation cooling system isolation, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and residual heat removal system isolation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee has provided its analysis of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
issue of no significant hazards consideration, which is presented below: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. The proposed changes do not involve a significant increase in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Technical specifications are proposed to be revised to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
perform a Channel Functional Test on a semiannual frequency 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
versus the current monthly frequency for both ambient and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
differential temperature and for the MSL tunnel temperature timer 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
functions, for the above listed piping lines. Additionally, this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
evaluation addressees the potential for, and implications of, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
common mode failures due to software, hardware and/or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
electromagnetic and radio-frequency interference (EMI/RFI). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The NUMAC instrumentation has certain design features which 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
contribute to its reliability. The replacement NUMAC LDMs are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
digital instruments that use a microcomputer to monitor the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ambient and differential temperatures (also the MSL tunnel 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
temperature timer) and provide outputs and automatic self-testing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and calibration. A description of the major design features 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
include: a) isolation of the essential microcomputer by a serial 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
data link from the front panel display (and display 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
microcomputer), b) a self-test system feature that provides 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
automatic testing of internal circuits and reports failures, c) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
thermocouple failure detection, d) provisions to test the output 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
relays without the use of jumpers (reducing the threat of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
spurious isolation), and e) two independent built-in instrument 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
power supplies (that automatically switchover to the other supply 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in the event of failure). Also, several features have been 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
included, among these, a) a hardware ``watchdog'' timer to monitor 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
against software cycling in continuous loops, and b) software 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
structured with the safety-related essential tasks running at the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
highest priority in the system. These capabilities increase the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reliability of the collected data, reduce the possibility of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
inadvertent isolation and plant shutdowns, reduce the need for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
frequent calibrations, and reduce the likelihood of common mode 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
failures. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The NUMAC Leak Detection Monitors will maintain the same 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
environmental and electrical physical independence criteria 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(qualifications) as the existing Leak Detection System 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
components. The LDMs, the associated thermocouple input units 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(TCIUs), and relay output units (ROUs) will be mounted 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
seismically such that qualification of these components and the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Control Room panels will be maintained. The LDMs are qualified 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for the PNPP Control Room environment. The LDMs (one per 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
division) will be physically and electrically independent of each 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
other and do not share power supplies, thermocouple inputs, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
output relays, microcomputer logic units, display units or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
enclosures and mounting locations. A postulated gross failure of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
any one NUMAC LDM, such as gross malfunction of the input unit, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
microcomputer logic unit or the relay output unit, will not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
propagate to the other NUMAC LDM, such as gross malfunction of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the input unit, microcomputer logic unit or the relay output 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
unit, will not propagate to the other NUMAC LDM. Thus, a failure 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
within one NUMAC LDM will not prevent or disable the function of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the other NUMAC LDM. A failure within one NUMAC LDM may cause 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the loss of one division of the isolation trip logic. However, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
since the other redundant division (the MSLs have three other 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
divisions) will not be affected by this failure, the Leak 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Detection System will still be able to perform its designed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
safety-related function and provide the necessary system 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
isolation. This is the same as the current Leak Detection System 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
design basis. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The possibility of a common mode failure of both NUMAC LDM 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
divisions is minimized by the design of the NUMAC hardware and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
software, the verification and validation (V&amp;V) of the software 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to reduce the likelihood of errors, the testing of the software 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(to discover and eliminate errors), and the design of and testing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of the hardware to demonstrate its resistance to EMI/RFI. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
NUMAC instrument design features, by effectively eliminating the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
potential for common mode failures, maintain the Leak Detection 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
System within its current licensing basis. (A discussion of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
common mode failure protection is presented in more detail in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
answer to question two.) Therefore, the design, isolation and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
separation criteria remain the same. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Additionally, as described within Chapter 7 of the Updated Safety 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Analysis Report (USAR), diversity is provided to the ambient and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
differential temperature monitoring trip functions for the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
various systems by alternative leak detection methods (such as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
measuring steam line flow or pressure) that provide backup in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
event of the loss of both divisions of the NUMAC Leak Detection 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Monitors. These alternative leak detection methods are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
physically separate from those being performed by the NUMAC LDM 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and constitute a diverse, redundant, safety related backup 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
capable of responding to a design basis line break for the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
various systems. Therefore, a common mode failure of both LDM 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
divisions would not prevent any of the necessary system isolation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
from occurring. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
No changes are being made to the isolation logic of the Leak 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Detection System. No accident initiators or precursors are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
affected by the proposed changes to the Channel Functional Test 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
surveillance intervals for the various trip functions. One 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
purpose of a Channel Functional Test is to check the instrument 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
setpoints. The NUMAC instrument setpoints are set digitally and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
do not drift. An engineering evaluation has established that the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Channel Functional Test surveillance interval can be extended 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
from one to six months. The potential for common mode failures 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
has been accounted for in the design and measures have been taken 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to lower the probability of this to an acceptable level (see the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
answer to question two). Also, alternative leak detection 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
methods exist for this eventuality. Since the NUMAC Leak 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Detection Monitoring equipment meets or exceeds the design and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
licensing criteria specified for the Leak Detection System, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proposed upgrade cannot increase the probability of occurrence of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
any accident previously evaluated. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A portion of the Leak Detection System logic causes a closure of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the Main Steam Isolation Valves on a steam leak signal. This 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
transient, described in Chapter 15 of the USAR, may also occur 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
due to a LDS equipment malfunction. Since this modification 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
replaces some of the existing Riley temperature monitoring 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
instrumentation with more reliable instrumentation the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
probability of this transient is reduced (no radiological 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
consequences are associated with this event). The LDS is also 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
used to mitigate the consequences of a pipe break outside primary 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
containment by isolating the affected system connected to the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Reactor Coolant Pressure Boundary (RCPB). The replacement of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Riley instrumentation with NUMAC LDMs will not change, degrade, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
or prevent the Leak Detection System response to mitigate the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
radiological consequences of an accident. Therefore, replacement 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of the Riley temperature modules with NUMAC Leak Detection 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Monitors will not significantly increase the consequences of any 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
accident previously evaluated. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. The proposed changes do not create the possibility of a new or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
different kind of accident from any accident previously 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
evaluated.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The single failure criterion requires that any single failure 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
within a safety-related system not prevent proper protective 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
action of the overall system when the system is required to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
function. The Leak Detection System design is such that a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
failure of one division will not prevent the system from 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
performing its safety function. Common mode failure protection 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
provisions have been addressed in the NUMAC LDM design. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The comprehensive General Electric software V&amp;V and configuration 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
management control programs minimize, although they cannot 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
entirely eliminate, the likelihood of a common mode NUMAC 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
instrument failure due to software problems. The hardware 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(firmware) and software for the PNPP NUMAC Leak Detection 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Monitors will undergo a formal software verification and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
validation (V&amp;V) process by General Electric, that is to be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
completed by the end of the year, equivalent to the one reviewed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and approved by the NRC for the safety-related Wide Range Neutron 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Monitor. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The NUMAC instruments are designed to minimize both their 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
susceptibility to, and generation of, electromagnetic and radio-
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
frequency interference (EMI/RFI) to prevent spurious operations 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and allow their use in safety-related systems. As part of a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
broader plan by GE to improve the testing has been performed by 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
GE on the Leak Detection Monitor configuration in order to both 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
expand the overall qualification region, and to obtain test data 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
specific to this application. This testing ensures the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
qualification of the Thermocouple Input Unit (TCIU), a NUMAC 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
circuit board which is unique to the LDM application, and also 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
extends the NUMAC EMI/RFI qualification region to include both 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
higher and lower frequencies than previously tested. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The NUMAC instrument design concept has undergone review by the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
NRC, and the initial instruments of the NUMAC product line (the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Logarithmic Radiation Monitor and Wide Range Neutron Monitoring 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
System) have received NRC approval via Safety Evaluation of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
associated GE Licensing Topical Reports. The various types of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
NUMAC equipment in operation at other nuclear power plants have 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
components and software modules which are similar to and in some 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
instance identical to the NUMAC LDMs. Therefore, based on the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
NRC reviewed and approved NUMAC software and hardware control 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
programs instituted by GE, the design features to minimize 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
software/hardware (or their interface) problems, design features 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to minimize susceptibility to EMI/RFI, and testing to demonstrate 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
resistance to EMI/RFI, installation of NUMAC Leak Detection 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Monitors at the PNPP does not create the possibility of a new or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
different kind of accident from any previously evaluated. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. The proposed changes do not involve a significant reduction in a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
margin of safety. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The replacement of the analog Riley temperature modules with the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
microcomputer based NUMAC Leak Detection Monitors will not affect 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
any design conditions or impact the margins of safety for the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
various Leak Detection System monitored parameters in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Technical Specification Table 3.3.2&hyph;2 will not be changed or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
affected by this modification. Only the CHANNEL FUNCTIONAL test 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
interval is being extended. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The NUMAC Leak Detection Monitor design, with the attention paid 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
towards minimizing the potential for, and the effect of, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
software/hardware and/or EMI/RFI related problem or common mode 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
failures and resulting operational experience has demonstrated 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that replacement of the existing Riley temperature modules with 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
NUMAC Leak Detection Monitors would not result in a significant 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reduction in the margin of safety. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The NRC staff has reviewed the licensee's analysis and, based on this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
review, it appears that the three standards of 10 CFR 50.92(c) are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
satisfied. Therefore, the NRC staff proposes to determine that the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
amendment request involves no significant hazards consideration.

The amendment would revise the WNP&hyph;2 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Technical Specifications. Specifically, the amendment would increase the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
stroke time, as specified in Table 3.6.3&hyph;1, for reactor core isolation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
cooling (RCIC) valve RCIC&hyph;V&hyph;8, from 13 seconds to 26 seconds and the note 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(j) reference would be deleted from RCIC&hyph;V&hyph;8 and RCIC&hyph;V&hyph;63. The note (j) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
indicates that the stroke time specified in the Table reflects the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requirement for containment isolation only. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee has provided its analysis of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
issue of no significant hazards consideration, which is presented below: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. This proposed action does not involve a significant increase in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the probability or consequences of an accident previously 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
evaluated. RCIC&hyph;V&hyph;8 and V&hyph;63 are containment isolation valves 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and are normally open. Failure of the valves to open or close 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
cannot cause an accident. The mitigating capability of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
RCIC&hyph;V&hyph;8 and V&hyph;63 is not changed in that the valves will continue 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to be closed within the established time limits. This ensures 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
protection of the safety related equipment necessary for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
continued compliance with the requirements of General Design 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Criterion 4. In those accidents which involve a source term and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
potential adverse dose release consequences, no credit is taken 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for the closing of the valves; therefore the increase in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
allowable time for closing does not increase the consequences of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
those accidents. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. This proposed action does not create the possibility of a new or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
different kind of accident from any accident previously 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
evaluated. The requested Technical Specifications change does 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
not represent a change in modes of operation. It does not, in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
itself, require physical modification to the plant, although it 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
will be used to allow a gear change in RCIC&hyph;MO&hyph;8. The new gears 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
represent a standard configuration for Limitorque motor operators 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and will require a routine design change. The required Technical 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Specification change maintains the licensing basis for the plant 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
as discussed in response to question 1. Hence, no new or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
different kind of accident is possible as a result of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
implementing this change. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. This proposed action does not involve a significant reduction in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a margin of safety. The increase in stroke time will increase 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the peak temperature in the HELB profiles and thereby decrease 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the margin available from the equipment qualification limits. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
However, sufficient margin remains to assure the equipment 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
operability is maintained and there is no reduction in the margin 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of safety. Additionally, there is no reduction in the margin of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
safety because increasing the stroke time will not change the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
postulated radiological releases.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposed change would relocate the instrument response time tables 3.3.1&hyph;2, Reactor Protection System
(RPS) Response Times; 3.3.2&hyph;3, Isolation System Instrumentation (ISI) Response Time; and 3.3.3&hyph;3,
Emergency Core Cooling System (ECCS) Response Times, from the Technical Specifications to the Updated Final Safety
Analysis Report. The RPS, ISI, and ECCS instrument limiting conditions for operation (LCO) will be revised to read
that the instruments ``shall be operable'' without a reference to a specific response time table in these LCOs. The
references to the response time tables will also be deleted from the Surveillance Requirements.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
During the period since publication of the last biweekly notice, the Commission has issued the following amendments.
The Commission has determined for each of these amendments that the application complies with the standards and requirements
of the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as amended (the Act), and the Commission's rules and regulations. The Commission
has made appropriate findings as required by the Act and the Commission's rules and regulations in 10 CFR Chapter I,
which are set forth in the license amendment.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Unless otherwise indicated, the Commission has determined that these amendments satisfy the criteria for categorical
exclusion in accordance with 10 CFR 51.22. Therefore, pursuant to 10 CFR 51.22(b), no environmental impact statement
or environmental assessment need be prepared for these amendments. If the Commission has prepared an environmental
assessment under the special circumstances provision in 10 CFR 51.12(b) and has made a determination based on that
assessment, it is so indicated.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The amendment revises Technical Specification (TS) 3.4.3.2.d and related Table 3.4.3.2&hyph;1 by changing the
allowable leakage for certain low pressure coolant injection (LPCI) line pressure isolation valves and revises
Table 3.6.3&hyph;1 to remove the designation as containment isolation valves from the LPCI injection reverse flow
check and bypass valves. The related Bases are also changed. Concurrently, the Commission granted an exemption from
the requirements of 10 CFR Part 50, Appendix J, III.C. for performing Type C containment integrated leak rate tests
of the containment isolation valves in the low pressure coolant injection lines of the residual heat removal system
and to perform alternative testing.

Brief description of amendment:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The proposed amendment would delete 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Technical Specification (TS) 3/4.9.9, ``Refueling Operations_Containment 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Purge and Exhaust Isolation System,'' and its bases, because of its 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
redundancy to other TSs that address the operability requirements of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
containment purge and exhaust isolation system. Also, the proposed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
amendment would revise TS 3/4.3.2, ``Safety System Instrumentation_Safety 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Features Actuation System Instrumentation,'' and TS 3.4.9.4, ``Refueling 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Operations_Containment Penetrations,'' and its bases. The effect of this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proposed change would be to allow the bypass of the safety features 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
actuation system in Mode 6, ``Refueling,'' by the use of the containment 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
purge and exhaust system noble gas monitor in conjunction with manual 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
closure of the containment purge and exhaust isolation valves instead of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
automatic closure.

Ledoux and Company (Licensee) is the holder of Byproduct, Source Material, and Special Nuclear Material Licenses
Nos. 29&hyph;01442&hyph;01, SMC&hyph;1181, and SNM&hyph;296 (Licenses), respectively, issued by the Nuclear
Regulatory Commission (NRC or Commission) pursuant to 10 CFR parts 30, 40, and 70.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Byproduct material License No. 29&hyph;01442&hyph;01 authorizes the Licensee to possess byproduct material for
use in the analysis of fission products and neutron-induced radionuclides in various materials, and to possess byproduct
material to be used in the calibration of radioassay equipment, including the development of analytical chemical
procedures. Byproduct material License No. 29&hyph;01442&hyph;01 was originally issued on November 20, 1956,
was most recently renewed on March 8, 1989, and was due to expire on March 31, 1994, but has remained in effect pursuant
to 10 CFR 30.37 and a timely request for renewal by the Licensee in accordance with a Licensee letter dated February
24, 1994.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Source Material License No. SMC&hyph;1181 authorizes the Licensee to possess source material for analysis of samples
and preparation and use of working standards.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Source Material License No. SMC&hyph;1181 was originally issued on December 14, 1973, was most recently renewed
on January 10, 1991, and is due to expire on January 31, 1996.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Special Nuclear Material License No. SNM&hyph;296 authorizes the Licensee to possess plutonium and uranium-235
for use in laboratory sample analysis and calibration of instruments. Special Nuclear Material License SNM&hyph;296
was originally issued on April 1, 1959. This license was most recently renewed on March 13, 1989, and was due to expire
on March 31, 1994, but has remained in effect pursuant to 10 CFR 303.37 and a timely request for renewal by the Licensee
in accordance with a Licensee letter dated February 24, 1994.

As of July 27, 1990, the Licensee was required to comply with the regulations set forth in 10 CFR 30.35, 10 CFR 40.36,
and 10 CFR 70.25. These regulations require that licensees authorized to possess licensed material in the amounts
listed in the above-listed Licenses, must submit a certification of financial assurance or a decommissioning funding
plan to the NRC. These regulations have been established to assure that licensees demonstrate adequate financial
responsibility that funds necessary for a safe decommissioning are available and planned, thus providing adequate
assurance that the facility will be decommissioned prior to terminating licensed activities.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On August 18, 1992, the NRC issued a Demand for Information to the Licensee since the NRC had not, as of that date, received
financial assurance from the Licensee. The Demand for Information was issued to determine whether the Licenses should
be modified, suspended or revoked. NRC sent letters dated October 21, 1992, and November 16, 1993 to the Licensee,
and telephone conversations were held with the Licensee on September 28, 1990, January 13, 1992, December 14, 1993,
and January 5, 1994, emphasizing the importance of providing the NRC the required financial assurance. Furthermore,
an NRC inspection was conducted on October 18&hyph;19, 1993 (during which the Licensee committed to provide the required
financial assurance by the end of 1993), and an enforcement conference was held with the Licensee on March 15, 1994,
to emphasize the significance with which the NRC viewed the failure to provide financial assurance.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In response to the NRC Demand for Information, dated August 18, 1992, Ledoux and Company provided, by letter dated
September 10, 1992, a decommissioning cost estimate of $113,013. However, a financial assurance mechanism to cover
the estimated amount was not provided. On November 5, 1993, the Licensee informed the NRC by letter that it intended
to establish an escrow account in the amount of $125,000 as its financial assurance mechanism by January 1, 1994. On
December 28, 1993, the Licensee informed the NRC by letter that it needed more time to provide a suitable financial
assurance mechanism due to unforeseen circumstances. During the enforcement conference on March 15, 1994, Ledoux
and Company representatives indicated that a financial assurance mechanism would not be provided in the next month.
On April 5, 1994, the Licensee stated in a letter that it was planning to provide 2 ``letters of credit *&blank;*&blank;*''
and that it would need some time. However, to date no financial assurance mechanism has been provided to the NRC.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As described in Section I, the Licensee is authorized to receive, possess, use, and transfer a wide range of byproduct
material, special nuclear material, and source material in quantities set forth in its Licenses. The regulations
specified in 10 CFR 30.35, 10 CFR 40.36, and 10 CFR 70.25 require licensees to provide financial assurance such that
licensed facilities will be decommissioned in a safe and timely manner, and that adequate funds will be available
for decommissioning to ensure that the health and safety of the public is protected. The Licensee has continually
failed to provide to the NRC the required financial assurance contrary to the requirements in 10 CFR 30.35, 10 CFR 40.36,
and 10 CFR 70.25, yet continues to perform NRC-licensed activities. The Licensee is either unwilling or unable to
comply with the financial assurance requirements. The public health and safety require the Licensee to have adequate
funds and financial assurance for decommissioning to ensure that decommissioning of the Licensee's facilities
can be completed in a safe and timely manner. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Consequently, I lack the requisite reasonable assurance that sufficient funding will be available for decommissioning
of the facility in compliance with Commission requirements, and that the health and safety of the public, including
the Licensee's employees, will be protected in connection with the decommissioning of the Licensee's facilities.
This is significant should the Licensee discontinue operations without appropriate financial assurance for the
decommissioning. Therefore, the public health, safety, and interest require that License Nos. 29&hyph;01442&hyph;01,
SMC&hyph;1181, and SNM&hyph;296 be suspended.

<DOCTITLE>Washington Public Power Supply System; Notice of Consideration of Issuance of Amendment to Facility Operating License,
Proposed No Significant Hazards Consideration Determination, and Opportunity for a Hearing</DOCTITLE>
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (the Commission) is considering issuing an amendment to Facility Operating
License No. NPF&hyph;21 issued to Washington Public Power Supply System (the licensee) for operation of its Nuclear
Project No. 2 (WNP&hyph;2) plant, located in Benton County, Washington.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed amendment changes the plant operating license to rename three primary containment isolation check
valves listed in the technical specifications. The licensee is making an administrative change to rename valve PI&hyph;EFC&hyph;X29d
to make its number consistent with other similar valves in the technical specifications. The license is renaming
excess flow check valves PI&hyph;EFCX&hyph;72f and PI&hyph;EFCX&hyph;73e because they are replacing them with
swing check valves that have a different numbering nomenclature.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Before issuance of the proposed license amendment, the Commission will have made findings required by the Atomic
Energy Act of 1954, as amended (the Act), and the Commission's regulations.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Commission has made a proposed determination that the amendment request involves no significant hazards consideration.
Under the Commission's regulations in 10 CFR 50.92, this means that operation of the facility in accordance with the
proposed amendment would not (1) involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident
previously evaluated; or (2) create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously
evaluated; or (3) involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety. As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the license
has provided its analysis of the issue of no significant hazards consideration, which is presented below:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Supply System has evaluated the proposed changes against the above standards as required by 10 CFR 50.91(a) and
concluded that the change does not:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Revising the equipment piece number (EPN) for PI&hyph;EFC&hyph;X29d to PI&hyph;EFC&hyph;X29b in Technical Specification
Table 3.6.3&hyph;1 is an administrative change and provides consistency between the Technical Specifications
and approved design bases. PI&hyph;EFC&hyph;X29d provides instrument line break (ILB) mitigation as analyzed
in FSAR Section 15.6.2. Renaming PI&hyph;EFC&hyph;X29d has no impact on FSAR accident analyses.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Replacing existing excess flow check valves PI&hyph;EFCX&hyph;72f and PI&hyph;EFCX&hyph;73e with swing check
valves and changing the EPNs has no impact on the containment isolation design basis described in FSAR Section 6.2.4.3.2.2.3.3.
This plant modification will conform the plant to the FSAR design basis. The FSAR describes the drywell and suppression
chamber air sampling lines and indicates that ``the return lines are equipped with *&blank;*&blank;* a reverse-oriented
excess flow check valve used as a simple check valve inside of containment.'' Replacement of the spring loaded excess
flow check valve with a simple check valve (without a spring) meets plant design bases and 10CFR50 Appendix A, General
Design Criterion (GDC) 56 criteria for containment isolation. The valve change and resulting EPN change do not impact
the FSAR design analyses.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Therefore, this change does not increase the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
No new mode of operation of any equipment results from the valve design change or EPN change for the three excess flow
check valves. Renaming valve PI&hyph;EFC&hyph;X29d is an administrative change.

<!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The replacement, and subsequent EPN change, of inboard containment isolation excess flow check valves PI&hyph;EFCX&hyph;72f
and PI&hyph;EFCX&hyph;73e with swing check valves brings the plant into conformance with the analyzed design bases.
Operation and maintenance of these valves in accordance with design and Technical Specification requirements provide
assurance that primary containment will be maintained for the design basis LOCA event. The EPN change is required
to conform to standard nomenclature for identification of penetration isolation valves.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Therefore, this change does not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously
evaluated.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The administrative name change for PI&hyph;EFC&hyph;X29d is made to ensure consistency between Technical Specification
Table 3.6.3&hyph;1 and existing plant design documentation. Renaming this excess flow check valve provides consistency
to the nomenclature of other excess flow check valves which use a dual tube method of draining condensate.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The replacement and subsequent EPN change of inboard containment isolation valves PI&hyph;EFCX&hyph;72f and PI&hyph;EFCX&hyph;73e
brings the plant into conformance with the analyzed design bases. Maintenance and operation requirements are not
modified in any manner. Adherence to the analyzed design bases will not affect the margin of safety for the design bases
analysis.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Therefore, this change does not involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In preparing this request the Technical Specification Bases were reviewed for impact. No changes are necessary to
address the EPN changes or the replacement of two excess flow check valves with swing check valves.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Based on this review, the Supply System has determined that the three standards of 50.92(c) are satisfied. Accordingly,
the Supply System has determined that this amendment request involves no significant hazards consideration.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The NRC reviewed the licensee's analysis and, based on this review, it appears that the three standards of 10 CFR 50.92(c)
are satisfied. Therefore, the NRC staff proposes to determine that the amendment request involves no significant
hazards consideration.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Commission is seeking public comments on this proposed determination. Any comments received within 30 days after
the date of publication of this notice will be considered in making any final determination.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Normally, the Commission will not issue the amendment until the 30-day notice period expires. However, should circumstances
change during the notice period such that failure to act in a timely way would result, for example, in derating or shutdown
of the facility, the Commission may issue the license amendment before the expiration of the 30-day notice period,
provided that its final determination is that the amendment involves no significant hazards consideration. The
final determination will consider all public and State comments received. Should the Commission take this action,
it will publish in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 a notice of issuance and provide for opportunity for a hearing after issuance. The Commission expects that the need
to take this action will occur very infrequently.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Written comments may be submitted by mail to the Rules Review and Directives Branch, Division of Freedom of Information
and Publications Services, Office of Administration, U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission, Washington, DC 20555,

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
By June 13, 1994, the licensee may file a request for a hearing with respect to issuance of the amendment to the subject
facility operating license, and any person whose interest may be affected by this proceeding and who wishes to participate
as a party in the proceeding must file a written request for a hearing and a petition for leave to intervene. Requests
for a hearing and a petition for leave to intervene shall be filed in accordance with the Commission's ``Rules of Practice
for Domestic Licensing Proceedings'' in 10 CFR part 2. Interested persons should consult a current copy of 10 CFR 2.714
which is available at the Commission's Public Document Room, the Gelman Building, 2120 L Street NW., Washington,
DC 20555 and at the local public document room located at the Richland Public Library, 955 Northgate Street, Richland,
Washington 99352. If a request for a hearing or petition for leave to intervene is filed by the above date, the Commission
or an Atomic Safety and Licensing Board, designated by the Commission or by the Chairman of the Atomic Safety and Licensing
Board Panel, will rule on the request and/or petition; and the Secretary or the designated Atomic Safety and Licensing
Board will issue a notice of hearing or an appropriate order.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As required by 10 CFR 2.714, a petition for leave to intervene shall set forth with particularly the interest of the
petitioner in the proceeding, and how that interest may be affected by the results of the proceeding. The petition
should specifically explain the reasons why intervention should be permitted with particular reference to the following
factors: (1) The nature of the petitioner's right under the Act to be made party to the proceeding; (2) the nature and
extent of the petitioner's property, financial, or other interest in the proceeding; and (3) the possible effect
of any order which may be entered in the proceeding on the petitioner's interest. The petition should also identify
the specific aspect(s) of the subject matter of the proceeding as to which petitioner wishes to intervene. Any person
who has filed a petition for leave to intervene or who has been admitted as a party may amend the petition without requesting
leave of the Board up to 15 days prior to the first prehearing conference scheduled in the proceeding, but such an amended
petition must satisfy the specificity requirements described above.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Not later than 15 days prior to the first prehearing conference scheduled in the proceeding, a petitioner shall file
a supplemental to the petition to intervene which must include a list of the contentions which are sought to be litigated
in the matter. Each contention must consist of a specific statement of the issue of law or fact to be raised or controverted.
In addition, the petitioner shall provide a brief explanation of the bases of the contention and a concise statement
of the alleged facts or expert opinion which support the contention and on which the petitioner intends to rely in proving
the contention at the hearing. The petitioner must also provide references to those specific sources and documents
of which the petitioner is aware and on which the petitioner intends to rely to establish those facts or expert opinion.
Petitioner must provide sufficient information to show that a genuine dispute exists with the applicant on a material
issue of law or fact. Contentions shall be limited to matters within the scope of the amendment under consideration.
The contention must be one which, if proven, would entitle the petitioner to relief. A petitioner who fails to file
such a supplement which satisfies these requirements with respect to at least one contention will not be permitted
to participate as a party.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Those permitted to intervene become parties to the proceeding, subject to any limitations in the order granting leave
to intervene, and have the opportunity to participate fully in the conduct of the hearing, including the opportunity
to present evidence and cross-examine witnesses.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If a hearing is requested, the Commission will make a final determination on the issue of no significant hazards consideration.
The final determination will serve to decide when the hearing is held.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

I. Introduction
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
On December 22, 1993, the New York Stock Exchange, Inc. (``NYSE'' or ``Exchange'') submitted to the Securities and
Exchange Commission (``SEC'' or ``Commission''), pursuant to section 19(b)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of
1934 (``Act'')
<FOOTCITE>1</FOOTCITE>
 and Rule 19b&hyph;4 thereunder,
<FOOTCITE>2</FOOTCITE>
 a proposed rule change to revise its standards for the listing and delisting of debt securities. On April 1, 1994, the
NYSE submitted to the Commission Amendment No. 1 to the proposed rule change in order to clarify its interpretation
of certain provisions of the original filing.

The proposed rule change was published for comment in Securities Exchange Act Release No. 33531 (January 27, 1994),

II. Description of the Proposal
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Paragraphs 102.03 and 103.05 of the NYSE's Listed Company Manual set forth the current standards for listing debt
securities of domestic and foreign issuers, respectively, on that Exchange. Under either paragraph, the NYSE uses
the following minimum criteria to determine whether a debt security is eligible to be listed: The bond issue must have
an aggregate market value or principal amount of $5 million; the anticipated distribution must be ``sufficient for
trading on the Exchange''; and the company must be in a position to cover interest charges on all debts issued by it for
a subsidiary. In this regard, the NYSE deems interest coverage to be inadequate if the interest charges on all debt
issued by the company, its parent or a subsidiary exceed earnings, before or after taxes, as reported in a filing to
the Commission.
<FOOTCITE>3</FOOTCITE>
 Finally, Paragraphs 102.03 and 103.05 allow the Exchange to list convertible debt only if the underlying common stock
also is listed on the NYSE.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
</FOOTNOTE>

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The delisting standards for debt securities are set forth in paragraphs 801.00 and 802.00 of the Listed Company Manual.
The NYSE normally gives consideration to delisting a bond issue if the aggregate market value or principal amount
falls below $1 million, or if the company's interest coverage is deemed to be inadequate.
<FOOTCITE>4</FOOTCITE>
 The NYSE also can review the continued listing of a debt security pursuant to certain other criteria in paragraph 802.00
(
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
e.g.,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 ``authoritative advice received that security is without value,'' ``inability to meet current debt obligations
or to adequately finance operations''). In terms of convertible bonds, paragraph 801.00 states that it is the NYSE's
customary policy to delist a convertible security if the related common stock is delisted.

</FOOTNOTE>

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The NYSE proposes to simplify and relax its standards for the listing and delisting of debt securities, in order to
make the Exchange's trading and disclosure systems more accessible to bond issuers. Specifically, the proposed
amendments to paragraphs 102.03 and 103.05 will eliminate the requirement that the Exchange evaluate the anticipated
distribution of a bond issue,
<FOOTCITE>5</FOOTCITE>
 and will replace the current definition of adequate interest coverage with a new standard based on issuer or bond rating
status.
<FOOTCITE>6</FOOTCITE>
 In addition, the NYSE proposal will permit the Exchange to list convertible debt whenever the underlying equity security
is subject to real-time sale reporting in the United States.
<FOOTCITE>7</FOOTCITE>
 Only the requirement that the bond issues have an aggregate market value or principal amount of no less than $5 million
will remain unchanged.

Listed Company Manual, which governs the procedures an issuer must follow to list its debt securities on the NYSE.

As noted above, the NYSE proposal contains a new standard for evaluating whether a debt issuer has the ability to meet
its interest obligations. Rather than using an earnings deficit, or the lack thereof, as the basis for making that
determination,
<FOOTCITE>8</FOOTCITE>
 the Exchange will rely instead on either (1) its own initial and continued listing standards for equity securities
or (2) the analysis of a nationally recognized securities rating organization (``NRSRO'').

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Specifically, if an issuer of NYSE listed equity is in ``good standing'' with the Exchange,
<FOOTCITE>9</FOOTCITE>
 the NYSE normally will list that company's debt securities so long as they have an aggregate market value or principal
amount of at least $5 million. This standard also will apply to an issuer owned by, or under common control with, an issuer
of NYSE listed equity; and to an issuer whose debt securities are guaranteed by an issuer of NYSE listed equity. According
to the NYSE, because debt enjoys seniority over equity, the ``good standing'' test warrants listing an ``affiliated''
issuer's bonds.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In contrast, debt securities of an ``unaffiliated'' issuer
<FOOTCITE>10</FOOTCITE>
 will not be eligible for initial listing on the NYSE unless an NRSRO has assigned a certain minimum rating to the bonds
(or to other bonds issued by the same company). Thus, the NYSE will be able to list such a debt issue only if it has received
a rating no lower than a Standard and Poor's (``S&amp;P'') Corporation ``B'' rating (or another NRSRO's equivalent
thereof). If the issue proposed to be listed has not been rated, those bonds must be either senior to, or 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
pari passu 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
with,
<FOOTCITE>11</FOOTCITE>
 an issue that has received at least an S&amp;P Corporation ``B'' rating (or another NRSRO's equivalent thereof).
Alternatively, the proposed rule change will allow the NYSE to list unrated bonds that are junior to an investment
grade issue.

As defined in the NYSE proposal, ``an `unaffiliated' issuer is one that has no equity securities listed on the Exchange;
is not, directly or indirectly, majority-owned by, nor under common control with, an issuer of Exchange-listed equity
securities; and is not issuing a debt security that an issuer of Exchange-listed equity securities is guaranteeing.''

To be investment grade, an issue must be assigned a rating no lower than an S&amp;P Corporation rating of ``BBB'' (or
another NRSRO's equivalent thereof). The NYSE has indicated that it will apply this standard only to unrated bonds
which are immediately junior to another rated class of securities issued by the same company. Telephone conversation

As under current Paragraph 802.00, the NYSE will give consideration to delisting a bond issue if its aggregate market
value or principal amount falls below $1 million, or if the issuer is unable to meet its obligations on the listed debt
securities.
<FOOTCITE>13</FOOTCITE>
 The NYSE also will retain the discretion to remove a bond from listing if, among other things, ``authoritative advice
[is] received that [the] security is without value.'' As a practical matter, the NYSE has indicated that it normally
will not delist debt where there is value in the security and continued exchange trading is in the best interests of
investors.
<FOOTCITE>14</FOOTCITE>
 The Exchange, however, has committed to give serious consideration to delisting a bond issue if the debt security
has minimal or no value and the issuer is unable to meet its financial obligations.

The development and enforcement of adequate standards governing the initial and continued listing of securities
on an exchange is an activity of critical importance to financial markets and the investing public. Listing standards
serve as a means for a self-regulatory organization to screen issuers and to provide listed status only to bona fide
companies with sufficient float, investor base and trading interest to maintain fair and orderly markets. Once a
security has been approved for initial listing, maintenance criteria allow an exchange to monitor the status and
trading characteristics of that issue to ensure that it continues to meet the exchange's standards for market depth
and liquidity. For the reasons set forth below, the Commission believes that the proposed rule change will provide
the NYSE with greater flexibility in determining which debt securities warrant inclusion in its bond trading and
disclosure systems, without compromising the benefits that the Exchange's listing standards offer to investors.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
After careful review, the Commission has concluded that the initial listing standards in paragraphs 102.03 (for
domestic issuers) and 103.05 (for foreign issuers), as amended, should ensure that only substantial companies capable
of meeting their financial obligations are eligible to have their bonds listed on the NYSE. As before, the proposed
rule change will require that the NYSE evaluate an issuer's ability to cover the interest charges on its debt securities.
Although the Exchange currently makes this interest coverage determination itself,
<FOOTCITE>21</FOOTCITE>
 the amended standards will rely instead on either the issuer's relationship with the NYSE or the bonds' NRSRO rating.

The Commission agrees that, to the extent the NYSE has adequate listing standards for common stock, the Exchange reasonably
may assume that NYSE listed companies (and certain affiliates thereof)
<FOOTCITE>22</FOOTCITE>
 in ``good standing'' with the Exchange
<FOOTCITE>23</FOOTCITE>
 are in solid financial condition and do not pose a significant risk of defaulting on their obligations. Moreover,
as the NYSE correctly notes, debt securities enjoy seniority over equity securities. Because the NYSE presumably
would not have listed the junior equity issue unless it was satisfied with the quality of the company, the Commission
is unable to conclude that the NYSE has no basis for its assumption that the senior debt issue also warrants listed status.

For ``unaffiliated'' issuers, the Commission finds that it is not unreasonable for the Exchange to defer to the expertise
of an NRSRO, rather than conducting its own analysis of the company's financial condition, as is presently the case.
<FOOTCITE>24</FOOTCITE>
 Although the Commission would be concerned by any potential misuse of NRSRO ratings, the Commission notes that the
NRSROs routinely evaluate interest coverage, among other things, when they rate bonds. In addition, their methodology,
unlike the NYSE's, incorporates even more extrinsic factors, such as characteristics of the issuer's industry group.
<FOOTCITE>25</FOOTCITE>
 The Commission therefore agrees with the Exchange that, under these circumstances, NRSRO ratings can be relied upon
for determinations about the creditworthiness of the issuer.

Moreover, the Commission is satisfied that the distinctions in NRSRO ratings drawn by the NYSE are valid. According
to the S&amp;P Corporation's debt rating definitions,
<FOOTCITE>26</FOOTCITE>
 bonds rated ``B'' (or higher) currently have the capacity to meet interest payments and principal repayments, whereas
bonds rated ``CCC'' (or lower) are dependent upon favorable business, financial or economic conditions to meet timely
payments of interest and repayment of principal. The Commission also believes that it is logical for the NYSE to assume
that an unrated debt issue which is 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
pari passu
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 with (or senior to) an issue with at least a ``B'' rating would, if rated, receive an equal (or higher) rating. Finally,
to permit the NYSE to list unrated bonds that are immediately junior to an investment grade issue is appropriate because
those bonds generally would be rated no more than one rating category lower (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
i.e.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As for the other provisions in Paragraphs 102.03 and 103.05, the Commission finds that they strike an appropriate
balance between protecting investors and enhancing the flexibility of the debt listing process. For instance, the
proposed rule change retains the current requirement that, to be eligible for listing, a bond issue must have an aggregate
market value or principal amount of at least $5 million. This should enable the NYSE to deny listed status to companies
whose securities do not have sufficient liquidity for a fair and orderly market, without infringing upon 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
bona fide
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 issuers' access to the Exchange's bond trading and disclosure systems.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Conversely, the Commission does not believe that eliminating the distribution requirement will have a significant
adverse effect on investors in the bond market. The NYSE currently evaluates distribution of debt securities in an
ad hoc fashion. The NYSE does not specify a mandatory minimum threshold for the number of bonds outstanding and/or
the number of holders thereof but only requires a distribution ``sufficient for trading on the Exchange.'' In the
past, the Commission has recognized that such information may be difficult to estimate accurately and may be relatively
less pertinent than other factors.
<FOOTCITE>28</FOOTCITE>
 From the Commission's perspective, the benefits of streamlining the Exchange's substantive review is appropriate,
especially since the NYSE has discretion not to list an otherwise eligible debt issue if such status would be unwarranted.

In terms of the delisting criteria in Paragraph 802.00, the Commission has concluded that the revised standards should
enable the NYSE to identify listed companies that may have insufficient resources to meet their financial obligations
or whose debt securities may lack adequate trading depth and liquidity. This, in turn, will allow the Exchange to take
appropriate action to protect bondholders. In this regard, the NYSE has indicated that it normally will not delist
a debt security if it has value and if continued exchange trading is in the best interests of investors; however, the
NYSE has pledged to give serious consideration to delisting bonds which, based on their market price,
<FOOTCITE>29</FOOTCITE>
 have minimal or no value. In applying this standard, the Commission expects the NYSE to consider carefully the propriety
of continued exchange trading of the securities of bankrupt or distressed companies,
<FOOTCITE>30</FOOTCITE>
 and expects bonds with minimal value to be delisted.

The Commission also is satisfied with the NYSE's framework for the listing and delisting of convertible debt securities.
By authorizing the Exchange to list and trade bonds that are convertible into any equity security subject to real-time
last sale reporting in the United States (rather than merely NYSE listed common stock), the proposed rule change should
help the NYSE adapt to today's rapidly changing market environment.
<FOOTCITE>31</FOOTCITE>
 The Commission notes that, like the NYSE, the other national securities exchanges and the National Association of
Securities Dealers, Inc. (``NASD'') make quote and trade information publicly available on a ``real-time'' basis.
As a result, the Commission believes that the NYSE proposal should ensure that investors have information necessary
to price convertible bonds.

<!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In the Commission's opinion, the above goals also will be furthered by the requirement that convertible bonds be delisted
whenever the underlying equity security is no longer subject to a reporting obligation. If the related equity merely
moves from the NYSE to another market, it is not inconsistent with the Act for the Exchange to have discretion to continue
listing the convertible debt, unless the underlying security is delisted because the issuer has violated one of the
NYSE's corporate responsibility criteria. As a general matter, the Commission would have serious concerns about
any proposal that does not provide for the delisting of convertible bonds where a company acts to disadvantage its
shareholders. The NYSE addresses this concern by committing to delist convertible bonds when the issuer has violated
corporate governance listing standards.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Finally, at this time, the Commission believes that it is reasonable for the NYSE to treat the debt of certain noncorporate
issuers (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
i.e., 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
foreign governments, American states and localities, government agencies) like the debt of ``unaffiliated'' corporate
issuers. As such, non-corporate debt would have to meet certain rating requirements before listing.
<FOOTCITE>32</FOOTCITE>
 Nevertheless, as the NYSE gains experience with listing and trading sovereign and municipal bonds, the Commission
expects the Exchange to monitor the adequacy of its existing standards and to develop more narrowly tailored ones
where appropriate.

Avenue interchange, (c) the addition of a new connector road which will connect 1860 South to U.S. Highway 89 (approximately
0.9 miles), (d) any needed modifications to 1860 South, from University Avenue to U.S. Highway 89, and University
Avenue, from I&hyph;15 to East Bay Boulevard, to accommodate present and future traffic needs.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
1. Basic Center Program for Runaway and Homeless Youth (BCP): The purpose of the BCP is to provide financial assistance

shelter, food, clothing, counseling, and aftercare services) of runaway and homeless youth and their families.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. Drug Abuse Education and Prevention Program for Runaway and Homeless Youth (DAPP): The purpose of the DAPP is to
improve and expand drug abuse prevention, education and information services to runaway and homeless youth and their
families. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. Transitional Living Program for Homeless Youth (TLP): The purpose of the TLP is to support projects in local communities
that provide long term shelter, skill training and support services to homeless youth; to assist homeless youth in
making smooth transitions to self-sufficiency; and to prevent long-term dependency on social services. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. Training and Technical Assistance (T&amp;TA) Grants: The purpose of this T&amp;TA is to improve the programmatic

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Family and Youth Services Bureau (FYSB), within the Administration on Children, Youth and Families (ACYF), administers
programs that support services to an adolescent population of approximately 1.3 million runaway and homeless youth.
Many of these youth have left home to escape abusive situations, or because their parents could not provide them with
the basic needs of food, shelter and a safe supportive environment. Many live on the streets. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
While living on the streets or away from home without parental supervision, these youth are highly vulnerable. They
may become victims of street violence, or may be exploited by dealers of illegal drugs. Usually lacking marketable
skills, they may be drawn into shoplifting, prostitution, and dealing drugs in order to earn money for food, clothing,
and other daily expenses. Without a fixed address or regular place to sleep, they often drop out of school, forfeiting
their opportunities to learn and to become independent, self-sufficient, contributing members of society. As street
people, they may try to survive with little or no contact with medical professionals, the result being that their health
problems may go untreated and may worsen. Without the support of family, schools, and other community institutions,
they may not acquire the personal values and work skills that will enable them to enter or advance in the world of work
at other than the most minimal levels. Finally, as street people, they may create substantial law enforcement problems,
endangering both themselves and the communities in which they are located. All these problems, real and potential,
call for a nationwide, community-based program to address the needs of runaway and homeless youth.

Section 364 of the Runaway and Homeless Youth Act (RHY Act) requires the Department to publish annually for public
comment a proposed plan specifying priorities the Department will follow in awarding grants and contracts under
the RHY Act. The proposed plan for FY 1994 was published in the

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 on

The Family and Youth Services Bureau (FYSB) received 13 written responses from a number of sources, including Runaway
and Homeless Youth Program grantees in seven different States. The responses were generally supportive and the following
summarizes the major issues raised:

<!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
a. A number of respondents suggested that applicants with demonstrated experience in providing quality direct services
to runaway and homeless youth be awarded extra points in the evaluation and ranking of their grant applications. The
Administration for Children, Youth and Families agrees with this suggestion. Accordingly, applicants documenting
such experience may receive up to five (5) extra points beginning with the current (FY 1994) reviews. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
b. A number of respondents supported the proposal to increase the project periods of the new Training and Technical
Assistance (T&amp;TA) awards from three to five years. The five-year project period will be adopted. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
c. A number of respondents suggested that the proposed focus of T&amp;TA activities on findings resulting from the
monitoring of runaway and homeless youth grantees might be too narrow. They suggested that T&amp;TA activities should
also address the perceived needs of local grantees, such as services to special populations and adherence to local
and State licensing requirements. The Administration on Children, Youth and Families recognizes that T&amp;TA
providers may take into account such justified training needs, so long as a major emphasis is placed on assisting grantees
in program improvement efforts, especially those efforts related to the findings from program monitoring activities.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
d. A number of respondents expressed concern that budget limitations on travel for Federal staff might lead to peer
reviewers making site visits unaccompanied by Federal staff, and that negative evaluations by the peers might undercut
Federal support for the affected grantees. The Administration on Children, Youth and Families recognizes that peer
reviewers can assess program operations from a professional point of view, identifying areas of strength and areas
for improvement, but that only Federal staff can be responsible for identifying and evaluating compliance issues
that may affect funding. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
e. Several respondents expressed concern about the potential for consolidation of the three current, categorical
programs for runaway and homeless youth (BCP, DAPP, and TLP) into a single program. Specific concerns included the
negative effects of limited funding, the possible neglect of RHY services in rural areas, and the difficulties of
a single grantee being required to address the entire range of youth problems. The Administration on Children, Youth
and Families is aware of these and a number of other concerns and issues regarding consolidation, and any effort to
consolidate these programs would include consultation with the field regarding implementation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
f. A number of respondents requested that they be sent information about applying for runaway and homeless youth grants.
All respondents will be entered into the mailing list to receive announcements of grant solicitations.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
To the extent feasible, ACYF addressed these and all other public comments in preparing the final priorities. The
final program priorities below reflect the changes made in the proposed priorities in light of the comments received.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
a. Direct Service Grants for Runaway and Homeless Youth. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Basic Center Program Grants. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Part A, section 311 of the Runaway and Homeless Youth Act, as amended, authorizes grants to public and private entities,
(State, Territorial, county, and local governments; agencies and subagencies of these governments; private for-profit
and private non-profit organizations; American Indian Tribes) and to combinations of such entities, to establish
and operate Basic Centers for Runaway and Homeless Youth. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Approximately 350 new and continuation Basic Center Program grants will be funded in FY 1994 to support organizations
which provide emergency services to runaway and homeless youth that include temporary shelter, food, clothing,
counseling, aftercare, and related services which are provided outside the law enforcement, child welfare, mental
health and juvenile justice systems. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Part III, section A of this publication announces the availability of funds for these grants, and includes the minimum
requirements that applicants must address in their applications for Basic Center Program funds.

<!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In FY 1994, approximately two-thirds of the current Basic Center grantees (those whose grant periods expire in FY
1995 or FY 1996) will be awarded noncompetitive continuation funds. The remaining grantees (those whose grant periods
expire in FY 1994) will have the opportunity to compete for new grant awards by submitting new competitive applications.
All other eligible youth-serving agencies not holding current awards may also apply for these new competitive funds.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Transitional Living Program Grants. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Part B, section 321 of the Runaway and Homeless Youth Act, as amended, authorizes grants to establish and operate transitional
living projects for homeless youth. This program is structured to help older, homeless youth achieve self-sufficiency
and avoid long-term dependency on social services. Transitional living projects provide shelter, skills training,
and support services to homeless youth ages 16 through 21 for a continuous period not exceeding 18 months. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A competition for new-start TLP awards was held in the summer of 1993 (in the last quarter of FY 1993) and successful
applicants were awarded a total of $5,966,650 in FY 1994 funds, beginning on October 1, 1993 (the first quarter of FY
1994). The remaining FY 1994 program funds will be awarded in the form of continuations to ongoing grants. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This announcement solicits applications for new Transitional Living Program grant awards to be supported with FY
1995 funds, subject to the appropriation of these funds by Congress. Project periods for these new awards will begin
when FY 1995 funds are appropriated and made available to ACYF, but in no case will they begin prior to October 1, 1994.
By soliciting applications and making funding decisions during 1994, we will enable current grantees not eligible
for FY 1994 continuation funds to compete for new grants to be funded early in FY 1995 and to continue their existing
projects with a minimal disruption of services, if successful in the competition. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Part III, section C of this publication announces the anticipated availability of funds for these FY 1995 grants,
and includes the minimum requirements that applicants must address in their grant proposals. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
b. National Communications System. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Part C, section 331 of the Runaway and Homeless Youth Act, as amended, mandates support for a national communications
system to assist runaway and homeless youth in communicating with their families and with service providers. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In FY 1991, a three-year grant was awarded to the National Runaway Switchboard, Inc., in Chicago, Illinois, to operate
the system. This grant expired in FY 1994. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
An announcement soliciting grant applications to operate the system for five years was published in the

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Part D, section 342 of the RHY Act authorizes the Department to make grants to statewide and regional nonprofit organizations
to provide training and technical assistance (T&amp;TA) to organizations that are eligible to receive service grants
under the Act. Organizations eligible to receive this T&amp;TA include the Basic Centers authorized under Part A
of the Act and the Transitional Living grantees authorized under Part B. In addition, section 3511 of the Anti-Drug
Abuse Act of 1988, which authorized the Drug Abuse Education and Prevention Program for Runaway and Homeless Youth
(DAPP), authorizes support for T&amp;TA to runaway and homeless youth service providers. The purpose of this T&amp;TA
is to strengthen the programs and to enhance the knowledge and skills of youth service workers.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In FY 1991, the Family and Youth Services Bureau awarded ten Cooperative Agreements, one in each of the ten Federal
Regions, to provide T&amp;TA to agencies funded under the three Federal programs for runaway and homeless youth (the
Basic Center Program, the Transitional Living Program, and the Drug Abuse Prevention Program). Each Cooperative
Agreement was unique, being based on the characteristics and different T&amp;TA needs in the respective Regions.
Each of the Cooperative Agreements has a three-year project period that will expire in FY 1994.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This announcement solicits applications for new five-year Cooperative Agreements to be supported with FY 1994 funds.
Specific application information and evaluation criteria are addressed in Part III, Section D.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) National Clearinghouse on Runaway and Homeless Youth.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In June 1992, a five-year contract was awarded to establish and operate the National Clearinghouse on Runaway and
Homeless Youth to serve as a central information point for professionals and agencies involved in the development
and implementation of services to runaway and homeless youth.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Clearinghouse is in full operation and is currently collecting materials and responding to requests for information.
Non-competitive continuation funding will be awarded to sustain the Clearinghouse in FY 1994.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Management Information System (MIS).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In FY 1992, a three-year contract was awarded to implement the Runaway and Homeless Youth Management Information
System (MIS) across three FYSB programs: The Runaway and Homeless Youth Basic Center Program, the Transitional Living
Program, and the Drug Abuse Prevention Program. The MIS, now a mandatory data collection system, is designed to be
used as a management tool for individual programs. In addition, FYSB uses the data generated by the system to produce
reports, to conduct analyses regarding the programs, and to provide information for required reports to Congress
on efforts to serve runaway and homeless youth.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Non-competitive continuation funding will be awarded to sustain the MIS in FY 1994.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) Monitoring Support for FYSB Programs.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In FY 1993, FYSB developed a comprehensive monitoring instrument and set of site visit protocols, including a peer-monitoring
component, for the Runaway and Homeless Youth Basic Center Program, the Transitional Living Program, and the Drug
Abuse Prevention Program. Additionally in FY 1993, a contract to provide logistical support for the peer monitoring
system was awarded.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The new peer monitoring system will improve Federal oversight of the RHY programs and will identify program innovations
along with program strengths and weaknesses. The findings will be used to direct the provision of technical assistance
and to inform policy development.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Continuation funding for the logistical contractor will be provided in FY 1994.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
d. Research and Demonstration Initiatives.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 343 of the Act authorizes the Department to make grants to States, localities, and private entities to carry
out research, demonstration, and service projects designed to increase knowledge concerning and to improve services
for runaway and homeless youth. These activities are important in order to identify emerging issues and to develop
and test models which address such issues.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In FY 1993, first-year funding was awarded to eight grantees to develop models of services to youth in rural areas.
These grants are expected to produce written descriptions of the proposed service models, to identify issues related
to model implementation, and to generate information on youth and program outcomes. The models will also incorporate
formal collaboration with other major youth-serving agencies in the rural areas.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Continuation funding of these eight grants will be provided in FY 1994.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Continuation funding will be awarded to an ongoing evaluation study entitled ``Development of Manuals for ACYF to
Use in Evaluating Demonstration Projects'' (FY 1993&hyph;present). This project is developing general and specific
manuals to assist ACYF grantees in the design and implementation of their internal program evaluations. One of the
specific manuals will be designed for FYSB grantees.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 announcement identifies ``eligible applicants'' differently. Accordingly, the definition appropriate to each
individual program is found in Part III of this announcement as a part of each priority area description.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Organizations that have current Basic Center and/or Drug Abuse Prevention Program grants with project periods ending
in FY 1994 and all remaining eligible applicants may apply for new grants for either or both of these two programs. Basic
Center and DAPP grantees with one or two years remaining on their current awards and the expectation of continuation
funding in FY 1994 may not apply for new grants under that particular grant program.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Organizations that have current Transitional Living Program grants with project periods ending in FY 1994 and all
remaining eligible applicants may apply for new Transitional Living Program grants. Transitional Living Program
grantees with one or two years remaining on their current awards and the expectation of continuation funding in FY
1994 may not apply for new grants under that particular grant program.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Statewide and Regional nonprofit organizations, and/or combinations of such organizations, with demonstrated
experience in providing services to runaway and homeless youth service providers are eligible to apply for T&amp;TA
grants.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Applicants may refer to Part VI, Appendix D for a listing of current grantees that are ineligible to apply for one or
more of these grant programs.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Non-profit applicants which have not previously received financial support from the Administration on Children,
Youth and Families must submit proof of their non-profit status with their grant application. This can be done either
by making reference to the applicant's listing in the Internal Revenue Service's (IRS) most recent list of tax-exempt
organizations or by submitting a copy of its letter from the IRS (IRS Code, sections 501(c)(3) and 501(c)(6)). Non-profit
applicants cannot be funded without acceptable proof of this status. Failure to provide proof of nonprofit status
will result in rejection of the application. Such applications will receive no further consideration from ACF. For-profit
entities may participate as grantees under Priority Area A, Runaway and Homeless Youth Basic Center Programs, but
may participate only as sub-grantees for any other priority areas in this announcement.

G. Availability of Funds
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Administration on Children, Youth and Families expects to award approximately 600 new and continuation grants
to serve runaway and homeless youth in FY 1994. Dollar amounts to be awarded by fiscal year and program are as follows:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
1. Basic Center Program for Runaway and Homeless Youth
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Administration on Children, Youth and Families expects to award $32,499,000 in Basic Center Program grants in
FY 1994. Of this total, $18,377,159 will be awarded in the form of non-competitive continuations to current grantees,
and the remaining $14,121,841 will be available for competitive, new-start awards. In accordance with the RHY Act,
the funds will be divided among the States in proportion to their respective populations under the age of 18. We recognize
that the RHY Act also conditionally requires that the amounts allotted to each State (including the District of Columbia
and Puerto Rico) be at least $100,000, and the amounts allotted to the Virgin Islands, Guam, American Samoa, the Trust
Territory of the Pacific Islands (Palau), and the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands be at least $45,000
each. However, to apply these minimum allocations in FY 1994 would result in 23 of the remaining States receiving less
than they received in FY 1992. Under these conditions, section 311(b)(3) of the Act becomes operable, which directs
that the ongoing State minimum of $75,000 and the ongoing Territorial minimum of $30,000 continue as the basic award
levels in FY 1994. The amount of funds available for both continuations and new starts in each of the States and Territories
is listed in the Table of Allocations by State (Part VI, Appendix E) which reflects the FY 1994 allocations for each
State. In this Table, the amounts shown in the column labeled New Starts are the amounts available for competition
in the respective States.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Current Basic Center Program grantees having one or two years remaining in their project periods will receive instructions
from their respective ACF Regional Offices on the procedures for applying for these continuation grants and should
not respond to this announcement. These grantees are listed in Part VI, Appendix D.1, have project expiration dates
in FY 1995 and 1996, and are not eligible to apply for new Basic Center grants.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Current Basic Center Program grantees with project periods ending by September 30, 1994, and all other eligible applicants
not currently receiving Basic Center funds may apply for the new competitive grants under this announcement. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The number of new awards made within each State will depend upon the funds available (i.e., the State's total allotment
less the amount required for non-competing continuations), as well as on the number of acceptable applications.
Therefore, where the amount required for non-competing continuations in any State equals the State's total allotment,
no new awards will be made. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
All applicants under this announcement will compete with other applicants in the State in which their services would
be provided. In the event that an insufficient number of acceptable applications is approved for funding from any
State or jurisdiction, the Commissioner, ACYF, will reallocate the unused funds.

The Administration on Children, Youth and Families awarded $6,117,067 for 33 new Transitional Living Program grants
in the first quarter of FY 1994 (October-December 1993). An additional $5,095,648 will be awarded in FY 1994 for TLP
continuation grants. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
No additional new TLP awards will be made in FY 1994. However, applications for new awards will be solicited in FY 1994
for funds to be provided in FY 1995 (beginning on October 1, 1994), subject to appropriation of funds by the Congress.
It is anticipated that approximately $5,000,000 will be available for these new grants.

This announcement solicits applications for projects of up to three years duration (36-month project periods),
with the exception of the T&amp;TA cooperative agreements which will be awarded for five-year project periods. Initial
grant awards, made on a competitive basis, will be for one-year (12-month) budget periods. Applications for continuation
grants beyond the one-year budget periods, but within the 36-month project periods, will be entertained in subsequent
years on a non-competitive basis, subject to the availability of funds, satisfactory progress of the grantees, and
determination that continued funding would be in the best interest of the government.

I. Maximum Federal Share and Grantee Share of the Project 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The maximum amount of Federal funds for which an applicant can apply is specified in each program description found
in Part III of this announcement. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The legislation authorizing runaway and homeless youth programs requires that grantees provide a non-Federal match
for Federal funds. In some cases, this non-Federal share is a percent of the total cost of the project and, in some cases,
it is a percent of the Federal share. Specific non-Federal share requirements for each Priority Area are found in Part
III of this announcement. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The non-Federal share may be met by cash or in-kind contributions. Federal funds provided to States and services or
other resources purchased with Federal funds may not be used to match project grants. Applicants which do not provide
the required percentage of non-Federal share will not be funded. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For-profit applicants for Basic Center Program grants are reminded that no grant funds may be paid as profit to any
recipient of a grant or sub-grant (45 CFR 74.705).

Eligible applicants: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Any State, unit of local government, combination of units of local government, public or private agency, organization,
institution, or other non-profit entity is eligible to apply for these funds. Federally recognized Indian Tribes
are eligible to apply for Basic Center grants. Non-Federally recognized Indian Tribes and urban Indian organizations
are also eligible to apply for grants as private, non-profit agencies. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Grantees (including subgrantees) with current Basic Center grants who are eligible to apply for continuation funding
in FY 1994 may not apply for a new Basic Center grant under this announcement. Applicants may refer to Part VI, Appendix
D.1 for a listing of current grantees which are ineligible for grants under this priority area. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As required by runaway and homeless youth legislation, priority for funding will be given to agencies with demonstrated
experience establishing and operating centers that provide direct services to runaway and homeless youth in a manner
that is outside the law enforcement system, the child welfare system, the mental health system and the juvenile justice
system. Demonstrated experience providing direct services means three (3) or more years of continuous effort serving
runaway and homeless youth in one or more areas set forth in section 312 of the Act. Applications claiming credit for
this preference must include a statement of no more than one page documenting the relevant experience.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Program purpose, goals, and objectives: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Administration on Children Youth and Families will award approximately 150 new service grants to establish or
strengthen existing or proposed runaway and homeless youth Basic Centers. These programs must be locally controlled
efforts that provide temporary shelter, counseling and other services to juveniles who have left home without permission
of their parents or guardians or to other homeless juveniles. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Applications are solicited under this priority area to carry out direct service projects designed to carry out the
program purpose, goals and objectives set forth in the legislation and as specified in Part I, section C.1 of this announcement.
These goals and objectives are: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. To alleviate the problems of runaway and homeless youth, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. To reunite youth with their families and to encourage the resolution of intrafamily problems through counseling
and other services, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. To strengthen family relationships and to encourage stable relationships for youth, and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. To help youth decide upon constructive courses of action. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Background: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Runaway Youth and Homeless Youth Act was enacted in response to widespread concern regarding the alarming number
of youth who were leaving home without parental permission, crossing State lines, and who, while away from home, were
exposed to exploitation and other dangers of street life. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Each Basic Center funded under the authorizing legislation is required to provide outreach to runaway and homeless
youth; temporary shelter for up to fifteen days; food; clothing; individual, group, and family counseling; and related
services. Many Basic Centers provide their services in residential settings with a capacity for no more than 20 youth.
Some centers also provide some or all of their shelter services through host homes (usually private homes under contract
to the centers), with counseling and referrals being provided from a central location. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Currently, approximately 60,000 youth annually receive shelter for an average of 12 nights and other ongoing services
through ACYF-funded Basic Centers. The primary presenting problems of these youth include conflict with parents
or other adults, including physical and sexual abuse (63 percent); other family crises such as divorce, death, or
sudden loss of income (9 percent); and personal problems such as drug use, or problems with peers, school attendance
and truancy, bad grades, inability to get along with teachers, and learning disabilities (28 percent). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Low self-esteem is a major problem among this population. Half (49 percent) have a poor self image; somewhat less than
half (43 percent) are depressed; and 12 percent are possibly suicidal. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
After receiving ongoing services from shelter programs, 50 percent of the youth return to their families. One-third
(33 percent) are provided alternative, but safe, long-term living arrangements. Five percent return to the streets,
and 12 percent leave the centers with no known destination.

Background: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The abuse of drugs has had an increasingly severe impact on runaway and homeless youth. Reports from shelters which
serve this client population indicate a growing drug abuse problem. In 1988, 15.4 percent of the youth entering shelters
indicated a personal drug abuse problem. In addition, 16.6 percent of the youth entering shelters reported that their
reason for running away was parental drug and/or alcohol abuse. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A 1990 survey, conducted by the National Network of Runaway and Youth Services, of 185 community-based agencies that
serve runaway and homeless youth found substance abuse to be the leading health problem among the youth served. Several
other studies reveal that the incidence of substance abuse among runaway and homeless youth in large urban areas is
significantly greater than the rate of abuse among other adolescents. The prevalence of the problem is underscored
by the fact that not only are youth-serving agencies in major urban areas reporting an increase in drug use among their
client population, but that providers in small towns and rural communities also are finding that more than half of
their clients are reporting drug abuse as a primary problem.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
While several studies provide some evidence of alcohol and drug abuse decline in the general youth population, recent
locally based studies indicate that this is not the trend among the runaway and homeless youth population. There is
a marked increase in the use of alcohol and other dangerous and addictive drugs such as cocaine and its derivative,
crack. Alcohol use among the younger adolescent population is also on the increase. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This population's circumstances require more detailed and focused approaches to prevention and drug reduction
services than those provided by traditional approaches. Many runaway and homeless youth have already experimented
with, or become frequent users of, one or more drugs and need effective programs which help them understand drug use
problems and teach them the decision-making skills they need to maintain a drug-free lifestyle. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Drug Abuse Education and Prevention Program (DAPP) provides Federal assistance to comprehensively address
the problem of drug involvement among runaway and homeless youth. Since the program's inception in 1989, ACYF has
awarded approximately $82 million in discretionary grants to approximately 450 agencies and organizations located
throughout the United States, including Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands. These awards were made to support a wide
variety of locally determined project designs which address the problem of drug involvement among runaway and homeless
youth. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
While varying degrees of success have been reported by DAPP grantees, many of the most promising programs have implemented
one or more of the following components: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. Candid discussions between youth and street-wise peer counselors and/or recovering youth substance abusers
who can discuss addiction and recovery from their personal experience; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. Sessions in which youth obtain accurate facts on any and all aspects of substance abuse and treatment; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. Presentation of decision-making and self-assertiveness skills and techniques that assist youth in making independent
choices and avoiding drug-involved friends and environments; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. Counseling and/or other strategies for helping youth to understand both the underlying causes of drug use and the
effect of drugs on them, their families, their peers and their communities; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
5. Educational information that portrays the consequences of overdosing, the effects of drug withdrawal, and the
increased chances of contracting the HIV virus and AIDS; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
6. The provision of specific and realistic information on various treatment options that are available, assistance
in enrolling in such programs, and appropriate follow-up by the service provider.

Activities that may be maintained, improved and/or expanded through a TLP grant must include, but are not necessarily
limited to: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Background: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
It is estimated that about one-fourth of the youth served by all runaway and homeless youth programs are homeless.
This means that many of the youth served cannot return home or to another safe living arrangement with a relative. Other
homeless youth have aged out of the child welfare system and are no longer eligible for foster care. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
These young people are often homeless through no fault of their own. The families they can no longer live with are often
physically and sexually abusive and involved in drug and alcohol abuse. They cannot provide the youth with their basic
human needs such as shelter, food, clothing, let alone the supportive and safe environment needed for development
of healthy self-images and the skills and personal characteristics which would enable them to mature into self-sufficient
adults.

<!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Homeless youth, lacking a stable family environment and without social and economic supports, are at high risk of
being involved in dangerous lifestyles and problematic or delinquent behaviors. More than two-thirds of homeless
youth served by ACYF-funded programs report using drugs or alcohol and many participate in survival sex and prostitution
to meet their basic needs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Homeless youth need a support system that will assist them in making the transition to adulthood and independent living.
While all adolescents are faced with adjustment issues as they approach adulthood, homeless youth experience more
severe problems and are at greater risk. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Homeless youth have been a population eligible to receive services under the Runaway and Homeless Youth Act since
1978, but the service goals for homeless youth are different from those of runaways. For example, family reunification,
though desirable, is typically not feasible for homeless youth. In many instances, programs serving the homeless
populations are able to provide only limited assistance to homeless youth, whose needs are more complex and longer-term
than those of runaway youth. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Transitional Living Program for Homeless Youth specifically targets services to homeless youth and affords
youth service agencies an opportunity to serve homeless youth in a manner which is comprehensive and geared towards
ensuring a successful transition to self-sufficiency. The TLP also improves the availability of comprehensive,
integrated services for homeless youth, which reduces the risks of exploitation and danger to which these youth are
exposed while living on the streets without positive economic or social supports.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Program purpose, goals and objectives: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Administration on Children, Youth and Families expects to fund up to ten cooperative agreements to improve the
programmatic and administrative capacities of public and private agencies to provide services to runaway and homeless
youth by the provision of technical assistance and short-term training. Applications to provide such assistance
may cover one or more Federal Regions or may be restricted to a smaller geographic area (e.g., one or more States). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Background information: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Over the years, many State and local agencies and programs have been established to provide needed short- and long-term
services to runaway and homeless youth. These agencies are both public and private, profit-making and nonprofit.
Some focus on a single concern, such as drug abuse or dropout prevention, while others are multi- or even all-purpose
agencies, with specific components that deal with the physical health, mental health, family reunification and
functioning, employment, education and transitional living of these young people. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Notwithstanding the significant numbers of effective agencies and competent professional staff dedicated to assisting
runaway and homeless youth across the country, services in some areas are inadequate or non-existent. In other cases,
existing programs lack staff members with the full range of skills required to carry out the responsibilities with
which the individual programs are charged. Also, many of the developed and tested curricula and models are little
known or understood, even among the programs and staff where they could be of greatest use. Further, as new issues and
problems emerge (for example, the glamorization of the youth drug culture by the news and entertainment media, and
the placement of troublesome youth in private mental institutions to remove them from the streets), even experienced
staff need to enhance their existing skills and to develop new ones. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
To address these issues, the Runaway and Homeless Youth Act, section 342, and the Drug Abuse Prevention Program for
Runaway and Homeless Youth, section 3511 of the Anti-Drug Abuse Act of 1988, both administered by the Family and Youth
Services Bureau, authorize support to nonprofit organizations for the purpose of providing training and technical
assistance (T&amp;TA) to runaway and homeless youth service providers. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
To effectively provide such assistance, extensive interaction with grantees, integration and sharing of knowledge,
coordination with components supporting the runaway and homeless youth system, and a cooperative relationship
among training and technical assistance providers is needed.

D. Notification Under Executive Order 12372 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This program is covered under Executive Order (E.O.) 12372, Intergovernmental Review of Federal Programs, and 45
CFR part 100, Intergovernmental Review of Department of Health and Human Services Programs and Activities. Under
the E.O., States may design their own processes for reviewing and commenting on proposed Federal assistance under
covered programs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
All States and Territories except Alabama, Alaska, Connecticut, Hawaii, Idaho, Kansas, Louisiana, Minnesota,
Montana, Nebraska, Oklahoma, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Virginia, Washington, American Samoa and Palau have elected
to participate in the Executive Order process and have established Single Points of Contact (SPOCs). Applicants
from these seventeen jurisdictions need take no action regarding E.O. 12372. Applications for projects to be administered
by Federally-recognized Indian Tribes are also exempt from the requirements of E.O. 12372. Otherwise, applicants
must contact their SPOCs as soon as possible to alert them to the prospective applications and receive any necessary
instructions. Applicants must submit any required material to the SPOCs as early as possible so that the program office
can obtain and review SPOC comments as part of the award process. It is imperative that the applicant submit all required
materials, if any, to the SPOC and indicate the date of this submittal (or date of contact if no submittal is required)
on the Standard Form 424, item 16a. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under 45 CFR 100.8(a)(2), a SPOC has 60 days from the application deadline date to comment on proposed new or competing
continuation awards. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The SPOCs are encouraged to eliminate the submission of routine endorsements as official recommendations. Additionally,
SPOCs are requested to clearly differentiate between mere advisory comments and those official State process recommendations
which may trigger the ``accommodate or explain'' rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
When comments are submitted directly to ACF, they must be addressed to: Runaway and Homeless Youth Programs, Department
of Health and Human Services, Administration for Children and Families, Division of Discretionary Grants, 370 L'Enfant
Promenade, SW., Aerospace Building, 6th Floor, Washington, DC 20047. Attn: Maiso Bryant.

F. Application Consideration 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
All applications which are complete and conform to the requirements of this program announcement will be subject
to a competitive review and evaluation process against the specific criteria outlined in Part II of this announcement
and the specific Minimum Requirements for Project Design contained in Part III of this announcement. This review
will be conducted in Washington, DC, by teams of non-Federal experts knowledgeable in the areas of youth development
and/or human service programs. Applications for a Basic Center Program grant will be reviewed competitively only
with other applications from the same State. Applications for Drug Abuse Prevention Program, Transitional Living
Program and Training and Technical Assistance grants will be reviewed as a part of a national competition. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The non-Federal experts will review the applications based on the Evaluation Criteria listed in Part II of this announcement
and the specific Minimum Requirements for Project Design contained in Part III of this announcement and will assign
a score to each application. The results of the competitive review will be analyzed by Federal staff who, in consultation
with ACF Regional officials, will select those applications to be recommended for funding to the Commissioner, ACYF.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Commissioner will make the final selection of the applicants to be funded. As required by runaway and homeless
youth legislation, priority for funding will be given to agencies with demonstrated experience in providing direct
services to runaway and homeless youth. However, current grantees ending a three-year funding period, and applying
as a new applicant for funds under this program announcement, are reminded that when the current project period ends
so does the funding agency's obligation for future awards. Criterion 3, Approach, requires applicants to specifically
discuss how their project will be maintained after termination of Federal support. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition to scores assigned by non-Federal reviewers, consideration also will be given to adequate geographic
distribution of services and the Commissioner may show preference for applications proposing services in areas
that would not otherwise be served. The Commissioner also may elect to consider an applicant's past performance in
providing services to runaway and homeless youth and also may elect not to fund any applicants having known management,
fiscal or other problems which make it unlikely that they would be able to provide effective services. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Grant awards for Basic Center Program, Drug Abuse Prevention Program and Training and Technical Assistance grants
will be made by September 30, 1994. Grant awards for Transitional Living Program grants will be made after October
1, 1994. Successful applicants will be notified through the issuance of a Financial Assistance Award which will set
forth the amount of funds granted, the terms and conditions of the grant, the effective date of the grant, the budget
period for which support will be given, the non-Federal share to be provided, and the total project period for which
support is contemplated. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Organizations whose applications will not be funded will be notified of that decision in writing by the Commissioner
of the Administration on Children, Youth and Families. Every effort will be made to notify all unsuccessful applicants
as soon as possible after final decisions are made, including grantees whose three-year project periods end in FY
1994.

Program Performance Standards

I. Purpose
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
The Program Performance Standards established by the Bureau for its funded centers relate to the basic program components
enumerated in section 317 of the Runaway and Homeless Youth Act and as further detailed in the Regulations and Program
Guidance governing the implementation of the Act. They address the methods and processes by which the needs of runaway
and homeless youth and their families are being met, as opposed to the outcome of the services provided on the clients
served.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The terms program performance standard, criterion, and indicators are used throughout both the instrument and the
instructions. These terms are defined as follows:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
Program performance standard: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
The general principle against which a judgment can be made to determine whether a service or an administrative component
has achieved a particular level of attainment.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
Criterion: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
A specific dimension or aspect of a program performance standard which helps to define that standard and which is amenable
to direct observation or measurement.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
Indicator: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
The specific documentation which demonstrates whether a criterion (or an aspect of a criterion) is being met and thereby
the extent to which a specific aspect of a standard is being met.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Fourteen program performance standards, with related criteria, are established by the Bureau for the projects funded
under the Runaway and Homeless Youth Act. Nine of these standards relate to service components (outreach, individual
intake process, temporary shelter, individual and group counseling, family counseling, service linkages, aftercare
services, recreational programs, and case disposition), and five to administrative functions or activities (staffing
and staff development, youth participation, individual client files, ongoing project planning, and board of directors/advisory
body).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Although fiscal management is not included as a program performance standard, it is viewed by FYSB as being an essential
element in the operation of its funded projects. Therefore, as validation visits are made, the Regional ACF specialist
and/or staff from the Office of Fiscal Operations will also review the project's financial management activities.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FYSB views these program performance standards as constituting the minimum standards to which its funded projects
should conform. The primary assumption underlying the program performance standards is that the service and administrative
components which are encompassed within these standards are integral (but not sufficient in themselves) to a program
of services which effectively addresses the crisis and long-term needs of runaway and homeless youth and their families.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The program performance standards are designed to serve as a developmental tool, and are to be employed by both the
project staff and the Regional ACF staff specialists in identifying those service and administrative components
and activities of individual projects which require strengthening and/or development either through internal
action on the part of staff or through the provision of external technical assistance.

The Family and Youth Services Bureau (FYSB) established NCRHY in June 1992 in response to the need for a central source
of information on runaway and homeless youth and the provision of services to that client population. As a national
resource for youth service professionals, policymakers and the general public, NCRHY offers the following specific
services: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Through its information line, bibliographic and FYSB program databases and special mailings, NCRHY distributes
information about successful program approaches, available resources and current activities relevant to runaway
and homeless youth organizations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
NCRHY develops semi-annual briefing packages to inform the field about new developments, ideas and issues related
to services to runaway and homeless youth. It also produces informational packets on FYSB programs and reports on
critical issues, best practices and model programs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
NCRHY facilitates FYSB-sponsored forums, bringing together experts in the field to discuss critical issues and
develop strategies for addressing the causes and consequences of runaway episodes and homelessness. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
NCRHY will assist FYSB in collaborating with national, State and local organizations on youth-related policy and
program initiatives.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This form is designated so that application can be made for funds from one or more grant programs. In preparing the budget,
adhere to any existing Federal grantor agency guidelines which prescribe how and whether budgeted amounts should
be separately shown for different functions or activities within the program. For some programs, grantor agencies
may require budgets to be separately shown by function or activity. For other programs, grantor agencies may require
a breakdown by function or activity. Sections A, B, C, and D should include budget estimates for the whole project except
when applying for assistance which requires Federal authorization in annual or other funding period increments.
In the latter case, sections A, B, C, and D should provide the budget for the first budget period (usually a year) and
section E should present the need for Federal assistance in the subsequent budget periods. All applications should
contain a breakdown by the object class categories shown in Lines a-k of section B.
