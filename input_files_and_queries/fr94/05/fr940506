SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 On January 6, 1993, the Food and Drug Administration announced in a final rule that, effective May 8, 1994, the current
food label reference values, the U.S. Recommended Daily Allowances (U.S.RDAs), will be identified as the Reference
Daily Intakes, or RDIs. This change is to be one of designation only and the reference values are not being modified.
The purpose of this rule is to replace the term ``U.S.RDA'' wherever used in Food and Nutrition Service program regulations
with ``RDI''.

Paperwork Reduction Act

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
No new data collection or recordkeeping requiring Office of Management and Budget (OMB) approval under the Paperwork
Reduction Act of 1980 (44 U.S.C. 3501 through 3502) are included in this rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Administrator of FNS has determined pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 553(b)(3)(B) that prior notice and comment on this rule
prior to implementation is unnecessary and contrary to public interest, and therefore good cause exists for making
this rule effective without prior public comment. This document makes technical changes and imposes no new requirements.
This rule updates 7 CFR parts 210 and 220 to incorporate a change made in the Food and Drug Administration's (FDA) nutrition
labeling regulations. There is no need for public comment because the change from the U.S.RDA reference to the RDI
reference does not effect the basis of the regulation. In addition, FDA has already made this change in the nutrition
labeling regulations the competitive foods rule must make the change in order to refer to an accepted reference.

Background 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) requires that certain food products be labeled with information sufficient
to apprise consumers of the nutritional content and value of the products. Food product labels are required to indicate
on a per serving basis the percentage contribution of the product to the recommended daily consumption of certain
vitamins and minerals considered essential for human nutrition. The amounts of these vitamins and minerals recommended
for daily consumption are known as the U.S. Recommended Daily Allowances or U.S.RDAs. The U.S.RDAs are derived by
FDA from the ``Recommended Daily Allowances,'' published by the Food and Nutrition Board of the National Academy
of Sciences-National Research Council (NAS&hyph;NRC). The Department employs the U.S.RDAs in the National School
Lunch, 7 CFR 210.11(b); Appendix B, and School Breakfast, 7 CFR 220.12(b)(1); appendix B, program regulations in
describing foods of minimal nutritional value which are prohibited from being sold in school food service areas during
regular meal service. The NAS&hyph;NRC Recommended Daily Allowances are referenced by the Department in the National
School Lunch and Food Stamp Program regulations to describe nutritional goals of the programs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In part to eliminate the public's confusion from the widespread use of both the U.S.RDAs and the NAS&hyph;NRC Recommended
Daily Allowances, and in part to reflect recent increases in the scientific knowledge concerning human nutrition
requirements, FDA is discontinuing use of the U.S.RDAs as of May 8, 1994. On that date, the U.S.RDAs will be replaced
by the Reference Daily Intakes, or RDIs, and the Daily Reference Values or DRVs. RDIs will be used to describe recommended
vitamin, mineral and protein consumption and DRVs in discussing fats and carbohydrates. RDI and DRV information
will not be used on food product labels. Rather, FDA is adopting a new nutrition labeling reference, known as the Daily
Value, which will combine RDI and DRV information and will be required on most packaged food products. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
To coincide with FDA's replacement of the U.S.RDAs with RDIs and DRVs, the Department is updating its references to
the U.S.RDAs in the regulations it administers. Effective May 8, 1994, the National School Lunch and School Breakfast
Program regulations will be amended by substituting the term RDI in place of U.S.RDA. The Department's current references
to the U.S.RDAs involve only vitamin and mineral content of food products. Therefore, no reference need be made by
the Department to the DRVs as that term will refer only to the fats and carbohydrates. References to the NAS&hyph;NRC
Recommended Daily Allowances in 7 CFR 210.10(b) and 272.5(b) will be unaffected by this regulatory change.

Business and Industry Disaster (BID) loans guaranteed under the authority of the Dire Emergency Supplemental Appropriations
Act cover costs arising from

the consequences of natural disasters, such as Hurricanes Andrew and Iniki and Typhoon Omar, that occur after August
23, 1992, and receive a Presidential declaration. Since the legislative authority to issue guarantees under BID
expired on September 30, 1993, a deadline of July 31, 1993, to file applications was placed in the regulation. This
was intended to give RDA staff time to process any applications before the guarantee authority expired. Due to additional
disasters that occurred in 1993, the application deadline is removed to allow additional time to apply for assistance.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 This amendment adopts a new airworthiness directive (AD) that is applicable to certain McDonnell Douglas Model MD&hyph;11
and MD&hyph;11F series airplanes. This action requires deactivation of the Visual Omnidirectional Receiver/Localizer
(VOR/LOC) option by revising the program pin wiring for the Flight Management Computer/Flight Control Computer
(FMC/FCC). This amendment is prompted by reports of uncommanded roll mode changes on these airplanes during takeoff
and landing due to incorrect initialization of VOR/LOC logic within the FMC. The actions specified in this AD are intended
to prevent the airplane from deviating from its intended flight path due to an uncommanded change in the course of direction.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 -->
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The FAA has received reports of uncommanded roll mode changes that have occurred on McDonnell Douglas Model MD&hyph;11
series airplanes during takeoff and landing. The airplanes involved in these incidents have been equipped with Honeywell
Flight Management Computers (FMC) having part numbers 4059050&hyph;907 and 4059050&hyph;908. The incidents occurred
when these FMC's were operating with the Visual Omnidirectional Receiver/Localizer (VOR/LOC) option selected.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Investigation revealed that these incidents of uncommanded roll mode changes were caused by one of the two FMC's not
automatically resetting or clearing all VOR mode logic upon landing. If the VOR mode was selected on the previous inbound
flight, and if this VOR mode is not automatically cleared after the airplane lands, the VOR logic may remain valid (in
operation) in one of the two FMC's onboard the airplane. If, during a subsequent flight, the autoflight system is engaged
to the FMC that still has the valid VOR 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
logic [either by disconnecting the autopilot (AP) or by swapping autopilots (AP1 to AP2, or vice versa) with the ``AUTOFLIGHT''
switch], that FMC will automatically command the airplane into a VOR roll mode. The airplane will then follow this
VOR mode logic guidance and fly in a direction not planned by the flight crew. Such an uncommanded change in course direction,
if not corrected, could result in the airplane deviating from its intended flight path. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FAA has reviewed and approved McDonnell Douglas MD&hyph;11 Alert Service 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Bulletin A34&hyph;55, dated April 22, 1994, that describes procedures for deactivating the VOR/LOC option on the
subject Honeywell FMC's by removing the VOR/LOC pin from the Flight Management Computer/Flight Control Computer
(FMC/FCC) configuration plug on the main avionics rack. This procedure will minimize the possibility of uncommanded
roll mode changes. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Since an unsafe condition has been identified that is likely to exist or develop on other Model MD&hyph;11 and MD&hyph;11F
series airplanes of the same type design, this AD is being issued to prevent the airplane from deviating from its intended
flight path due to an uncommanded change in the course of direction. This AD requires deactivating the VOR/LOC option
on certain Honeywell FMC's by removing the VOR/LOC pin from the FMC/FCC configuration plug on the main avionics rack.
The actions are required to be accomplished in accordance with the service bulletin described previously. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Since a situation exists that requires the immediate adoption of this regulation, it is found that notice and opportunity
for prior public comment hereon are impracticable, and that good cause exists for making this amendment effective
in less than 30 days.

The regulations adopted herein will not have substantial direct effects on the States, on the relationship between
the national government and the States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels
of government. Therefore, in accordance with Executive Order 12612, it is determined that this final rule does not
have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FAA has determined that this regulation is an emergency regulation that must be issued immediately to correct
an unsafe condition in aircraft, and is not a ``significant regulatory action'' under Executive Order 12866. It has
been determined further that this action involves an emergency regulation under DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures
(44 FR 11034, February 26, 1979). If it is determined that this emergency regulation otherwise would be significant
under DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures, a final

 This action alters the descriptions of several jet routes in Florida. Alteration of the current jet route structure
between Charleston, SC, Ormond Beach, FL, Savannah, GA, and Craig, FL, will enhance safety by increasing separation
between Jet Routes J&hyph;79, J&hyph;121, J&hyph;174, and J&hyph;103 and the western boundary of Warning Areas
W&hyph;157, W&hyph;158, and W&hyph;159.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
History 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
On April 5, 1993, the FAA proposed to amend part 71 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR part 71) to alter the descriptions
of several jet routes in Florida (58 FR 17541). An increase in the separation of the current jet route structure between
Charleston, SC, Ormond Beach, FL, Savannah, GA, and Craig, FL, from the western boundary of Warning Areas W&hyph;157,
W&hyph;158, and W&hyph;159 will enhance safety. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Interested parties were invited to participate in this rulemaking proceeding by submitting written comments on
the proposal to the FAA. One comment objecting to the proposal was received from the Air Transport Association (ATA).
The ATA believes that readjusting the boundaries of the warning areas is a better option for increasing the airspace
clearance between the jet routes and the warning areas rather than creating doglegs. ATA contends that these changes
will increase route mileage approximately .7 nautical miles, which translates into increased flight times, and
increased operating costs to the airline industry. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In order to ensure adequate airspace separation between the warning areas' western boundaries and Jet Routes J&hyph;79,
J&hyph;121, J&hyph;174, and J&hyph;103, it is necessary to realign these jet routes. Experience has shown that during
the winter months, very strong westerly winds exist at the jet route altitudes which can cause aircraft to rapidly
drift east of course toward the western boundaries of the warning areas. By moving the jet routes further to the west,
this action will enhance safety by increasing the distance from the warning areas. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Adjusting the boundaries of the warning areas is not a feasible alternative at this time. Radar, telemetry equipment,
and other range resources are strategically located based on existing warning area boundaries in order to support
the essential military activity. Relocation of these resources would be a costly and lengthy process. Therefore,
the FAA has determined that the most expeditious and cost-effective alternative is to alter the current jet route
structure. Except for editorial changes, and the previous amendments to Jet Routes J&hyph;79 and J&hyph;174 (contained
in Airspace Docket No. 92&hyph;ANE&hyph;45; effective May 27, 1993), this amendment is the same as that proposed
in the notice. Jet routes are published in paragraph 2004 of FAA Order 7400.9A dated June 17, 1993, and effective September
16, 1993, which is incorporated by reference in 14 CFR 71.1 (58 FR 36298; July 6, 1993). The jet routes listed in this
document will be published subsequently in the Order.

The Rule 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This amendment to part 71 of the Federal Aviation Regulations alters the descriptions of several jet routes in Florida.
Alteration of the current jet route structures between Charleston, SC, Ormond Beach, FL, Savannah, GA, and Craig,
FL, will increase separation from the western boundary of Warning Areas W&hyph;157, W&hyph;158, and W&hyph;159
and the jet routes. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FAA has determined that this regulation only involves an established body of technical regulations for which
frequent and routine amendments are necessary to keep them operationally current. It, therefore (1) is not a ``significant
regulatory action'' under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under DOT Regulatory Policies
and Procedures (44 FR 11034; February 26, 1979); and (3) does not warrant preparation of a regulatory evaluation as
the anticipated impact is so minimal. Since this is a routine matter that will only affect air traffic procedures and
air navigation, it is certified that this rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number
of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act.

History
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
On February 23, 1994, the FAA proposed to amend part 10 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR part 71) to establish
Class E airspace at Saint George Island, AK. (59 FR 12874.) A SIAP was being developed for the New St. George Airport
at Saint George Island. The proposal was to add controlled airspace extending from 700 feet and 1200 feet AGL for Instrument
Flight Rules (IFR) operations during portions of the terminal operation and while transiting between the enroute
and terminal environments. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Interested parties were invited to participate in this rulemaking proceeding by submitting written comments on
the proposal to the FAA. No objections to the proposal were received. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Airspace reclassification, in effect as of September 16, 1993, has discontinued the use of the term ``transition
area,'' and controlled airspace extending upward from 700 or 1200 feet above ground level is now Class E airspace.
Class E airspace designations for airspace areas extending upward from 700/1200 feet or more above ground level are
published in Paragraph 6005 of FAA Order 7400.9A dated June 17, 1993, and effective September 16, 1993, which is incorporated
by reference in 14 CFR 71.1 (58 FR 36298; July 6, 1993). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Class E airspace designation listed in this document will be published subsequently in the Order. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=2 -->
The Rule 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
This amendment to part 71 of the Federal Aviation Regulations establishes Class E airspace at Saint George Island,
AK, to provide controlled airspace from 700/1200 feet AGL for aircraft executing the NDB/DME SIAP and departure procedures
into and out of the New St. George Airport at Saint George Island. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FAA has determined that this regulation only involves an established body of technical regulations for which
frequent and routine amendments are necessary to keep them operationally current. It, therefore_(1) is not a ``significant
regulatory action'' under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under DOT Regulatory Policies
and Procedures (44 FR 11034; February 26, 1979); and (3) does not warrant preparation of a regulatory evaluation as
the anticipated impact is so minimal. Since this is a routine matter that will only affect air traffic procedures and
air navigation, it is certified that this rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number
of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act.

On February 23, 1994, the FAA proposed to amend part 71 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR part 71) to amend
the Class E airspace for the Portland International Airport, Portland, OR (59 FR 8568). Except for a typographical
omission of one line in the description, and reconsideration and deletion of another line in the description, this
rule is the same. No additional airspace, except that required for the new procedure, is required to compensate for
those omissions and deletions. Interested parties were invited to participate in the rulemaking process by submitting
such written data, views, or arguments as they desired. No comments were received. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Airspace reclassification, in effect as of September 16, 1993, has discontinued use of the terms ``control zone extension''
and ``transition area,'' replacing them with the designation ``Class E airspace.'' Class E airspace designations
for airspace areas extending upward from the surface of the earth, and Class E airspace designations for airspace
areas extending upward from 700 feet above ground level, are published in Paragraphs 6003 and 6005 respectively,
of FAA Order 7400.9A dated June 17, 1993, and effective September 16, 1993, which is incorporated by reference in 14
CFR 71.1 as of September 16, 1993 (58 FR 36298; July 6, 1993). The Class E airspace designations listed in this document
will be published subsequently in the Order. The coordinates in this final rule are in North American Datum 83.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
This amendment to part 71 of the Federal Aviation Regulations amends Class E airspace at Portland, Oregon. It will
provide controlled airspace for a new instrument approach procedure at the Portland International Airport. Amendment
of the Class E airspace will result in greater safety and efficiency at, and in the vicinity of, the airport. The FAA
has determined that this regulation only involves an established body of technical regulations for which frequent
and routine amendments are necessary to keep them operationally current. It, therefore, (1) is not a ``significant
regulatory action'' under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under DOT Regulatory Policies
and Procedures (44 FR 11034; February 26, 1979); and (3) does not warrant preparation of a regulatory evaluation as
the anticipated impact is so minimal. Since this is a routine matter that will only affect air traffic procedures and
air navigation, it is certified that this rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number
of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act.

History 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
On Tuesday, February 8, 1994, the FAA proposed to amend part 71 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR part 71)
to establish Class E airspace near Morris, IL, (59 FR 5740). Interested parties were invited to participate in this
rulemaking proceeding by submitting written comments on the proposal to the FAA. No comments objecting to the proposal
were received. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The coordinates for this airspace docket are based on North American Datum 83. Class E airspace designations are published
in Paragraph 6005 of FAA Order 7400.9A dated June 17, 1993, and effective September 16, 1993, which is incorporated
by reference in 14 CFR 71.1 (58 FR 36298; July 6, 1993). The Class E airspace designation listed in this document will
be published subsequently in the Order.

The Rule
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
This amendment to part 71 of the Federal Aviation Regulations establishes Class E airspace near Morris, IL, to accommodate
an amended VOR&hyph;A instrument approach procedure to Morris Municipal-James R. Washburn Field Airport, Morris,
IL. Controlled airspace extending upward from 700 to 1200 feet AGL is needed for IFR operations during portions of
the terminal operation and while transiting between the enroute and terminal environments. The area will be depicted
on aeronautical charts to enable pilots to circumnavigate the area in order to comply with applicable VFR requirements.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FAA has determined that this regulation only involves an established body of technical regulations for which
frequent and routine amendments are necessary to keep them operationally current. It, therefore_(1) is not a ``significant
regulatory action'' under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under DOT Regulatory Policies
and Procedures (44 FR 11034; February 26, 1979); and (3) does not warrant preparation of a regulatory evaluation as
the anticipated impact is so minimal. Since this is a routine matter that will only affect air traffic procedures and
air navigation, it is certified that this rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number
of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
This action establishes the Class E airspace at the Vance Brand Airport, Longmont, CO. Establishment of a new instrument
approach procedure requires additional controlled airspace for the procedure. Airspace reclassification, in
effect as of September 16, 1993, has discontinued use of the term ``transition area,'' replacing it with the designating
``Class E airspace.'' The Class E airspace will be depicted on aeronautical charts for pilot reference when the new
approach procedures become effective.

History
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
On February 18, 1994, the FAA proposed to amend part 71 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR part 71) to establish
the Class E airspace for the Vance Brand Airport, Longmont, Colorado (59 FR 8149). Interested parties were invited
to participate in the rulemaking process by submitting such written data, views, or arguments as they desired. No
comments were received.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Airspace reclassification, in effect as of September 16, 1993, has discontinued use of the term ``transition area,''
and airspace extending upward from 700 feet above ground level is now designated Class E airspace. Class E airspace
designations for airspace extending upward from 700 feet above ground level are published in Paragraph 6005 of FAA
Order 7400.9A dated June 17, 1993, and effective September 16, 1993, which is incorporated by reference in 14 CFR 71.1
(58 FR 36298; July 6, 1993). The Class E airspace designation listed in this document will be published subsequently
in the Order. The coordinates in this final rule are in North American Datum 93.

The Rule
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
This amendment to part 71 of the Federal Aviation Regulations establishes Class E airspace at Longmont, Colorado.
It will provide controlled airspace for a new instrument approach procedure at the Vance Brand Airport. Establishment
of the Class E airspace will result in greater safety and efficiency at, and in the vicinity of, the airport. The FAA
has determined that this regulation only involves an established body of technical regulations for which frequent
and routine amendments are necessary to keep them operationally current. It, therefore, (1) is not a ``significant
regulatory action'' under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under DOT Regulatory Policies
and Procedures (44 FR 11034; February 26, 1979); and (3) does not warrant preparation of a regulatory evaluation as
the anticipated impact is so minimal. Since this is a routine matter that will only affect air traffic procedures and
air navigation, it is certified that this rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number
of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
Although this action is in the form of a final rule, and was not preceded by notice and public procedure, comments are
invited on the rule. When the comment period ends, the FAA will use the comments submitted, together with other available
information, to review the regulation. If the FAA receives no adverse comments in response to this action, this rule
will become effective on the date specified in the ``DATES
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
'' section. After the review, if the FAA finds that further changes are appropriate, it will initiate rulemaking proceedings
to amend the regulation.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Comments that provide the factual basis supporting the views and suggestions presented are particularly helpful
in evaluating the effects of the rule, and in determining whether additional rulemaking is required. Comments are
specifically invited on the overall regulatory, aeronautical, economic, environmental, and energy-related aspects
of the rule which might suggest the need to modify the rule.

The Rule
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This amendment to part 71 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR part 71) modifies the Class D airspace areas at
Adak, Anchorage Merrill Field, Bethel, Juneau, Kenai, King Salmon, and Kodiak, AK, by amending the areas' effective
hours to coincide with the associated control tower's hours of operation. This action also establishes Class E airspace
at these areas when the associated control tower is closed. Prior to Airspace Reclassification, an airport traffic
area (ATA) and a control zone (CZ) existed at these airports. However, Airspace Reclassification, effective September
16, 1993, discontinued the use of the term ``airport traffic area'' and ``control zone,'' replacing them with the
designation ``Class D airspace.'' The former CZ was continuous, while the former ATA was contingent upon the operation
of the air traffic control tower. The consolidation of the ATA and CZ into a single Class D airspace designation makes
it necessary to modify the effective hours of the Class D airspace to coincide with the control tower's hours of operation.
The action also establishes Class E airspace during the hours the control tower is closed. The intended effect of this
action is to clarify when two-way radio communication with these air traffic control towers is required and to provide
adequate Class E airspace for instrument approach procedures when these control towers are closed.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The coordinates for this airspace docket are based on North American Datum 83. Class D and E airspace designations
are published in Paragraphs 5000 and 6002, respectively, of FAA Order 7400.9A dated June 17, 1993, and effective September
16, 1993, which is incorporated by reference in 14 CFR 71.1 (58 FR 36298; July 6, 1993). The Class D and E airspace designations
listed in this document will be published subsequently in the Order. Under the circumstances presented, the FAA concludes
that there is an immediate need to modify these Class D and establish these Class E airspace areas in order to promote
the safe and efficient handling of air traffic in these areas. Therefore, I find that notice and public procedures
under 5 U.S.C. 553(b) are impracticable and contrary to the public interest.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

The FAA has determined that this regulation only involves an established body of technical regulations for which

SUMMARY: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
The Federal Trade Commission announces that the present ranges of comparability for clothes washers will remain
in effect until new ranges are published. Under the Appliance Labeling Rule, each required label on a covered appliance
must show a range, or scale, indicating the range of energy costs or efficiencies for all models of a size or capacity
comparable to the labeled model. The Commission publishes the ranges annually in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
if the upper or lower limits of the range change by 15% or more from the previously published range. If the Commission
does not publish a revised range, it must publish a notice that the prior range will be applicable until new ranges are
published. The Commission is today announcing that the ranges published on April 16, 1991, will remain in effect until
new ranges are published.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
On November 19, 1979, the Commission issued a final rule,
<FOOTCITE>1</FOOTCITE>
 pursuant to section 324 of the Energy Policy an Conservation Act of 1975,
<FOOTCITE>2</FOOTCITE>
 covering certain appliance categories, including clothes washers. The rule requires that energy costs and related
information be disclosed on labels and in retail sales catalogs for all clothes washers presently manufactured.
Certain point-of-sale promotional materials must disclose the availability of energy usage information. If a clothes
washer is advertised in a catalog from which it may be purchased by cash, charge account or credit terms, then the range
of estimated annual energy costs for the product must be included on each page of the catalog that lists the product.
The required disclosures and all claims concerning energy consumption made in writing or in broadcast advertisements
must be based on the results of test procedures developed by the Department of Energy, which are referenced in the rule.

Section 305.8(b) of the rule requires manufacturers to report the energy usage of their models annually by specified
dates for each product type.
<FOOTCITE>3</FOOTCITE>
 Because the costs for the various types of energy change yearly, and because manufacturers regularly add new models
to their lines, improve existing models and drop others, the data base from which the ranges of comparability are calculated
is constantly changing.

Reports for clothes washers are due by March 1.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
</FOOTNOTE>

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
To keep the required information in line with these changes, under &sect;305.10 of the rule, the Commission publishes
new ranges (but not more often than annually) if an analysis of the new data indicates that the upper or lower limits
of the ranges have changed by more than 15% Otherwise, the Commission publishes a statement that the prior range or
ranges remain in effect for the next year.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The annual reports for clothes washers have been received and analyzed and it has been determined to retain the ranges
that were published on April 16, 1991.
<FOOTCITE>4</FOOTCITE>
 In consideration of the foregoing, the present ranges for clothes washers, which were based on a national average
electric rate of 8.24 cents per kilowatt hour and a national average natural gas rate of 60.54 cents per therm, will
remain in effect until the Commission publishes new ranges for these products.

In Order No. 563,
<FOOTCITE>1</FOOTCITE>
 the Commission adopted a final rule requiring the standardization of information relating to transportation of
natural gas across the interstate pipeline grid. The standards adopted by the Commission reflected the consensus
agreements reached by the natural gas industry through a series of informal conferences established by the Commission.
Under these standards, pipelines will have to provide access to the required information both on their Electronic
Bulletin Boards (EBBS) and through files which users can download from the pipelines' computers to their own computers.
Pipelines are required to implement the requirements of this rule by June 1, 1994, except for the requirements regarding
a common code for gas transaction points which are to be implemented by November 1, 1994.

 The Commission grants rehearing on one issue, downloads in a standardized ASCII flat file format. The Commission
had required pipelines to provide for file downloads in two formats: The first complied with established communication
standards and protocols for Electronic Data Interchange (EDI) and the second would have required that downloads
be made available in a standardized ASCII flat file specified by the Commission. The Commission agrees with those
seeking rehearing that the future of communications in the industry will be enhanced by the development of one industry
standard based on established communication standards and protocols, rather than by promulgation of a second non-standardized
methodology that has significant disadvantages compared with EDI. The Commission also clarifies the requirements
of the rule and the protocols as discussed below.

Working Groups 1 and 2 were responsible for developing data sets setting forth the information concerning available
capacity. Working Group 3 was responsible for developing standards relating to business transactions between pipelines
and their customers unrelated to the sale or release of capacity. Working Group 4 was responsible for developing a
set of communication protocols governing the dissemination of the information. Working Group 5 was responsible
for developing codes to identify companies and common transaction points.

The final rule adopted the consensus agreements reached by the industry in the Working Groups, with only slight modifications.
Sections 284.8(b)(5) and 284.9(b)(4) require pipelines to provide standardized information relating to firm and
interruptible service on their EBBs and to provide users with the ability to download the standardized information
in compliance with standardized procedures and protocols. The rule provides that the details of the required information,
procedures, and protocols will be made available in a document entitled ``Standardized Data Sets and Communication
Protocols,'' which will be available at the Commission's Public Reference and Files Maintenance Branch.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The standardized data sets specify the information concerning capacity availability that pipelines must provide
both on their on-line EBBs and through downloadable files.

 This information includes offers to sell firm capacity (either by the pipeline or releasing shippers), bids for capacity,
awards of capacity, withdrawals of capacity offers and bids, operationally available (

a mechanism for creating a common code data base for identifying pipeline transaction points, such as receipt and
delivery points.

On-line EBB refers to a continuous computer connection between a pipeline EBB and a user's computer in which the information
from the pipeline's computer is displayed visually on the user's computer and the user can enter data directly to the
pipeline's computer. File downloading refers to the transfer, in computerized format, of a file from the pipeline's
computer to the user's computer. The user then can use other computer programs to manipulate the data off-line when
it is not connected to the pipeline's computer.

</FOOTNOTE>

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The communication protocols establish principles and procedures relating to the operation of pipeline EBBs and
the provision of downloadable files to users. The most important of these protocols is the requirement that the pipelines
provide downloadable files that conform to the standards for Electronic Data Interchange (EDI) promulgated by the
American National Standards Institute (ANSI) Accredited Standards Committee (ASC) X12.

ASC X12 standards provide an electronic data submission capability that allows computers to exchange information
over communication lines using standardized formats. Since the ASC X12 transaction sets provide generic data groups
applicable to a range of potential applications, the transaction sets must be customized to individual applications
by correlating or ``mapping'' the specific information to an ASC X12 transaction set through an implementation guide.

In the rule, the Commission recognized that as pipelines began the process of implementing the data sets, they could
discover problems requiring modifications. The Commission stated that pipelines should communicate any problems
to the Working Groups, which should make the necessary modifications to the data set and submit them to the Commission
in sufficient time to permit implementation of the requirements by June 1, 1994.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

On March 4, 1994, Working Groups 1 &amp; 2 filed revised capacity release data sets and an implementation guide for

The initial Working Group reports included a number of issues on which the Working Groups had not yet reached agreement.
In the Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NOPR), the Commission concluded that the Working Groups should take more time
to consider these issues and try to reach consensus. The Commission provided that the Working Groups submit reports
on these matters to the Commission by February 1, 1994. In Order No. 563, the Commission found that resolution of these
issues should await the February 1, 1994 reports. Nevertheless, many of the requests for rehearing and clarification
address the same issues.

Working Groups 1 &amp; 2 could not reach consensus on several issues, and submitted reports from participants on the
following issues: proposals for electronic index of purchasers which would provide information about the capacity
rights of firm shippers, position papers on whether to require disclosure of aggregate firm and interruptible nominations
at pipeline points, and position papers on the methods for recovering electronic communication costs. Working Group
5 submitted reports on a consensus agreement for implementing a common code for company names. Working Group 4 submitted
a final report on communication protocols and operational logistics. Working Group 3 submitted a report containing
a proposal for implementing standards for nominations and confirmations and a schedule for developing standards
for other business transactions. Several participants also submitted position papers on the issue of ASCII flat

The Commission will address the issues raised by the rehearing requests in the following areas: data set implementation
and maintenance; specific information included, or proposed to be included, in the data sets (operationally available
capacity, unsubscribed firm capacity, and firm and interruptible flowing volume); electronic communication issues
(ASCII flat file downloads, file uploads, and subset downloads); common codes for companies and gas transaction
points; additional standards for an Index of Purchasers and non-capacity business transactions; and proposals
relating to the method for recovering the costs for implementing standards.

III. Issues Relating to Data Set Implementation And Maintenance 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
A. Implementation Date 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
AER/MRT contend that the June 1, 1994 implementation date places too great a burden on the pipelines, because they
are still in the midst of refining their restructured services and the compliance burden falls during the critical
shoulder months between January and March. They suggest a December 1, 1994 date. In particular, they contend that
they require the implementation guide for the ASC X12 data sets by February 1, 1994, and suggest that, if that date is
not met, the June 1, 1994 date should be relaxed. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Commission will not change the implementation date. In Order No. 563, the Commission agreed to extend the implementation
date from the April 1, 1994 date proposed in the NOPR until June 1, 1994. But, with this extension, the Commission expected
a fully operational set of standards to be in place by June 1. Working Groups 1 and 2 stated in their comments that the
June 1 date can be met if the ASC X12 implementation guide is available by March 1, 1994, and the Working Groups substantially
met this deadline, filing the data sets and implementation guide with the Commission on March 4, 1994, with public
notice given on March 7, 1994. AER/MRT is the only party alleging that the June 1 date cannot be met, and they have not
provided sufficient justification for extending the date further. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
B. Periodic Reports 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In Order No. 563, the Commission found no need for requiring pipelines to file tariffs specifying how they would comply
with the rule or to file periodic reports of their implementation progress. UDC/AGD renew their request that pipelines
be required to file periodic reports. Without such reports, they maintain no formal procedure would exist to provide
information on implementation progress or problems. They further claim such reports would provide useful information
about the development of the secondary market and the interplay between interruptible and released capacity. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Commission denies the request for rehearing. As stated in Order No. 563, the Commission will monitor implementation
of the rule by accessing the pipelines' EBBs, continuing to hold industry conferences, and by examining complaints.
These mechanisms provide a far more flexible method of oversight than attempting to specify particular items of information
for inclusion in periodic reports. As stated earlier, the Commission is committed to monitoring the EBBs and the implementation
of the standards, and to making revisions when needed.

C. Mechanism for Making Revisions to the Data Sets 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In Order No. 563, the Commission recognized that the standardization process was an ongoing one, which would require
revisions and modifications to the data sets and protocols as the industry obtains experience with operations under
the standards. The Commission stated it would continue the informal conferences and the Working Groups as the best
means for monitoring the standards, but did not adopt a specific mechanism for implementing proposed changes. The
Commission found that its determination of the proper method for making revisions may depend on the type of change
contemplated. The Commission stated, however, that in considering proposed changes, it would comply with the Administrative
Procedure Act (APA) and ensure parties have notice and an opportunity to comment on proposed changes. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Tenneco Gas asserts that providing a mechanism for addressing changes to the standards is critical and requests the
Commission to adopt a specific mechanism for making changes, which is both flexible and responsive. KGPC contends
many participants are unable to commit the resources to remain actively involved in the Working Group process and
urges the Commission to ensure adequate communication to the industry of proposed changes with an opportunity for
comment. AER/MRT similarly request clarification that the Commission will comply with the APA and provide notice
and an opportunity for comment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Commission recognizes that the standards and protocols will have to be revised and that a flexible mechanism is
needed for effectuating such changes. To provide the needed flexibility, the Commission adopted only a general regulation
referencing the separate standards and protocols and did not include those standards and protocols in the Code of
Federal Regulations. However, as explained in Order No. 563, the Commission cannot commit to one method for making
revisions because different circumstances may demand different procedural mechanisms; for example, maintenance
of the existing data sets may be treated differently than implementation of new requirements. As stated in Order No.
563, in making changes, the Commission will adhere to the APA and provide notice and an opportunity for public comment
before implementing changes.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Commission will clarify that the process for maintenance of the data sets promulgated in the rule will be generally
the same as the process used previously to adopt the revised data sets and implementation guide. The Working Groups
will file their suggested changes, which will be noticed with an opportunity provided for comment. To facilitate
discussion or improve understanding of proposed changes, Commission staff may convene a technical conference to
review the changes with the industry. The Commission will then issue an order adopting the data sets. This process
will enable the Commission to make changes in a timely fashion while still preserving the industry's ability to comment
on the changes. The Commission also encourages the Working Groups to consider other methods of informing non-participants
of impending changes prior to filing with the Commission so that the Working Groups themselves will be able to avail
themselves of a broad spectrum of input. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
While the Commission recognizes the need to revise the data sets, it also recognizes that making revisions and changes
on a piecemeal basis may be cumbersome and create added programming costs for both the pipelines and those obtaining
information either from the EBBs or through downloadable files. The Commission encourages the Working Groups to
consider an appropriate schedule for accumulating and submitting revisions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Tenneco Gas states it did not understand that the Working Groups would continue indefinitely. AER/MRT contend that
the Working Groups provide only a temporary solution and urge the Commission to recognize the contemplated Gas Industry
Standards Board (GISB) as the appropriate group to handle standards development. Although GISB is still in its formative
stage, AER/MRT recommend the Commission endorse GISB and charge it with the mission of further standards development.
Columbia Distribution suggests that one Working Group would be more efficient than the current five, because the
participants in the five Working Groups are essentially the same and one Working Group would streamline the process.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Commission finds that some mechanism for consideration and modification of the standards, whether GISB or the
Working Groups, must continue into the future. At this point, reliance on the GISB concept is premature, and the Commission
will continue the Working Group process which has worked very well in developing standards. As stated in Order No.
563, the Commission will consider the GISB concept when a final proposal has been developed and the Commission can
consider its impact on all facets of the gas industry. Meanwhile, the Working Groups should not delay or defer development
of standards in anticipation of the implementation of GISB. The Commission will leave the structure of the Working
Groups to be resolved by the industry at the informal conferences.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In the consensus data sets adopted by Order No. 563, data fields were denominated as mandatory, optional, and conditional.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Commission found that the rule required all pipelines to support the mandatory data fields. Pipelines would choose
whether to support the optional fields, unless they were required to support these fields by their tariff. The Commission
also stated that pipelines were required to display all information, whether mandatory or optional, on their on-line
EBBs.

AER/MRT seek clarification that the Commission was standardizing only the information to be provided on the on-line
EBBs, not the format in which the information is to be displayed. Others seek clarification about the display of all
the mandatory data fields on the on-line EBBs.

 They contend certain mandatory fields in the downloadable data sets are required only for file transfers, but not
for interactive, on-line transactions. They assert users of on-line EBBs will know some of the information in the
mandatory fields without having it displayed, so that required posting of the information is unnecessary and will
only clutter the EBB screens.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

Working Groups 1 &amp; 2 point to the fields for rate schedule, stand-alone offer indicator (whether the offer is tied
to another offer), and offer type (indicating the type of capacity being offered) as examples of information that
would be implicitly known to users of on-line EBBs and so need not be included on the EBB display.

KGPC, PEC Pipeline Group, and AER/MRT also request clarification that pipelines are not required to display optional

NGC requests clarification that pipelines must support the conditional fields. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Commission will clarify its requirements. The Commission required all pipelines to support the mandatory fields
because Order No. 563 included certain substantive requirements that pipelines may not previously have been required
by their restructuring orders to disclose on their EBBs. For example, not all pipelines may be providing the information
found in the operationally available capacity and critical notice data sets on their EBBs. The intent of the requirement
was only to ensure that the downloadable data sets and the on-line EBBs conveyed comparable information. Accordingly,
the Commission agrees that fields not required for on-line EBB use need not be displayed, so long as the on-line EBB
and the downloadable data set convey comparable information.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Display of optional fields on the on-line EBB must take place when such fields are included in the downloadable data
sets (unless, as stated above, they are not necessary for on-line use). Conditional fields must be supported by the
pipelines when the conditional field is dependent on information in a mandatory field.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
16
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 If the conditional field is predicated on the response to an optional field, the conditional field will have to be supported

2. Pipeline Modification of the Data Sets 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In Order No. 563, the Commission stated that pipelines could not add fields to, or delete fields from, the data sets,
finding that standardization required that all pipelines use the same structure for downloading. ASC X12 software
is keyed to specific fields on the implementation guide, and the Commission was concerned that if pipelines could
add or delete fields, shippers' software could not interpret the information. The Commission pointed out that the
data sets were designed flexibly to accommodate special release offers or unique circumstances by including fields
for special terms and miscellaneous notes. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
KGPC contends EDI permits the addition of fields without inhibiting communication with parties not using the additional
fields. It asserts the Commission should not unnecessarily inhibit the ability of the pipelines to customize their
EDI transactions with trading partners. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Although KGPC is correct that fields can be added to the ASC X12 data sets without affecting the ability of others to
use the original version, the Commission is concerned that if pipelines routinely add fields, the result would be
a plethora of non-standard data bases, and users of multiple pipeline data bases could have difficulty accessing
information that others could obtain.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
17
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Commission, therefore, will not permit pipelines to add additional fields. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<FOOTNOTE>
<FOOTNAME>
<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->

</FOOTNAME>
<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->
A simple example would be a standardized data set with 30 items. If pipeline 1 added data item 31 and pipeline 2 added
data item 31 to provide different information, a user of both pipelines would be unable to use the 31st data item because
its meaning would not be standardized. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
</FOOTNOTE>

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Working Groups 1 &amp; 2 are concerned about situations in which the circumstances facing a particular pipeline do
not fit the standardized format. They cite, as an example, a mandatory data field denominated a yes/no (Y/N) field
and a pipeline needing a third category (U) for unknown. They suggest the following working principle for dealing
with these problems: the pipeline will make a good faith effort to comply with the data sets, but if it cannot, it must
explain any discrepancies and seek a correction through the Working Group process. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Commission is concerned about pipelines changing the meaning of data set items. While the addition of an unknown
element for a field, as Working Group 1 &amp; 2 suggest, would seem unlikely to cause major communication difficulties,
the Commission cannot determine whether other changes in meaning might adversely affect those seeking to obtain
information from multiple pipelines.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
18
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Thus, pipelines should make every effort to use the data sets as promulgated, for instance, using a ``no'' indicator
or the miscellaneous note field even if these are not optimum solutions. When pipelines encounter difficulties in
using the standardized data sets, they should inform the Working Groups so that revisions can be considered. Once
changes are received from the Working Groups, the Commission is committed to reviewing them as quickly as possible,
but the Working Group changes may not be implemented unilaterally without Commission approval.

For example, those using multiple pipelines may have difficulty learning of such changes, and their computer software
may not be able to effectively process data sets from multiple pipelines if the meanings of elements are different.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Commission adopted the Working Groups' consensus agreement to require the pipelines to provide information
on the amount of unscheduled capacity available at specific locations, such as receipt and delivery points, mainline,
or mainline segments. The Commission found that this information satisfied the pipelines' obligation to post the
capacity available for interruptible service.

1. Objection To Posting the Amount of Operationally Available Capacity 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
TGPL requests rehearing of the requirement to post the actual quantity of unscheduled capacity. It contends the posting
of detailed information on unscheduled capacity will serve only to reduce the value of interruptible and firm service,
because potential shippers can use the unscheduled capacity information to demand the lowest price for the capacity.
It asserts the regulatory obligation to post interruptible capacity could be satisfied by the pipelines simply indicating
that interruptible capacity is available. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Commission denies TGPL's rehearing request. The Working Groups reached a consensus agreement to provide unscheduled
capacity, and TGPL is the only party raising an objection. Moreover, a marker indicating that interruptible capacity
is available is not sufficient to comport with the regulatory requirement to post available capacity. Under the Commission's
open access regulations, pipelines cannot withhold available capacity, and shippers, therefore, have the right
to know the amount of capacity available. Moreover, shippers need to know the amount of interruptible capacity available
in order to make a reasonable determination of whether interruptible service is sufficient for their needs or whether
they need to seek released firm service. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
2. Derivation of the Estimates of Operationally Available Capacity 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In Order No. 563, the Commission stated that the data for operationally available capacity could be estimates, and
left to the Working Groups the issue of whether an additional field would be needed to describe how the estimates were
derived. Working Groups 1 &amp; 2 reached agreement that a new field was not needed. They suggest a good faith effort
by each pipeline to provide a commercially reasonable estimate using internally consistent methods is sufficient.
The Commission, therefore, will not require the additional field at this time. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
B. Unsubscribed Firm Capacity 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
KGPC requests clarification that the Commission's reference in Order No. 563 to pipelines' posting their available
firm capacity in the offer data set does not require any change in its current practices for posting its available firm
capacity. KGPC states that, because it is a grid system with thousands of receipt and delivery points, it cannot post
in the offer data set the myriad configurations of firm capacity paths that might be available.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
20
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Instead, it states that it posts on its EBB the capacity available at each point and the subscribed capacity at each
point. Potential shippers then request possible combinations of capacity paths, and if KGPC determines firm capacity
is available along these paths, the resulting firm service will be posted in the capacity offer section of the EBB.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The revised data sets submitted by Working Groups 1 &amp; 2, and adopted by the Commission have accommodated KGPC's
concern. The operationally available capacity data set includes fields permitting pipelines to post unsubscribed
capacity available at receipt and delivery points, as KGPC states it does now. Once a potential shipper submits a request
for a capacity path that is available, the pipeline would then post the offer for that path in the offer data set.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
NGSA and NGC contend the Commission needs to require additional information to satisfy the pipelines' obligations

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
21
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 NGSA asserts the firm capacity available through capacity release is only a piece of the total picture of firm capacity
needed by potential shippers. NGSA contends the Commission also should require pipelines to post the total amount
of unscheduled (potentially available) firm capacity. NGC contends potential shippers cannot make reasonable
pricing decisions unless they know flowing primary firm volumes, flowing secondary firm volumes, flowing interruptible
volumes, and unscheduled volumes. KGPC, on the other hand, maintains that the Commission should not require the posting
of any information in addition to the unscheduled capacity already required.

 opposes providing any additional data. They contend the information is not readily available, the costs of providing
it would be high, and the information is not related to capacity release. They also assert the information would tilt
the capacity release market to favor capacity seekers at the expense of capacity holders. Whenever the information
showed that significant interruptible volumes are scheduled to flow, they maintain the value of released firm capacity
would be devalued. They further contend the now devalued released capacity will displace interruptible pipeline
capacity, thereby reducing the interruptible revenue credits provided to firm shippers.

 submitted a compromise seeking to balance the need for information about flowing volumes with the costs of providing
that information. Under their proposal, the pipelines would provide a ``flag'' indicating that interruptible volumes
are flowing at a point which would otherwise have no operationally available capacity. They assert that this flag
would alert both buyers and sellers that firm capacity at the point is available and could be valuable: if interruptible
volumes are flowing at a point that is operationally full, a purchaser of firm capacity could bump the interruptible
shippers.

Public notice of these filings was given on March 3, 1994, and the PEC Pipeline Group submitted a comment supporting
the interruptible flag proposal. It contends the flag provides a reliable indicator of the availability of firm capacity
(by showing that interruptible gas is flowing), but at a fraction of the cost of the proposal to post flowing volumes.

The Commission finds that the flag proposal identifying when interruptible capacity is flowing at constraint points
provides a reasonable compromise between informing users that firm capacity may be available at certain locations
and the costs of providing that information. With the addition of information on interruptible capacity provided
by the ``flag,'' shippers will have a sufficiently broad range of information about capacity availability. They
will know the amount of capacity available at points (operationally available capacity), whether firm capacity
is available at constraint points (interruptible flag), the firm capacity available through posted release transactions,
and the unsubscribed firm capacity available from the pipeline. This information should be sufficient for shippers
to make reasonable decisions about the transportation option to select. The Working Groups must include the interruptible
flag in the next iteration of the data sets.

In addition to adopting the consensus agreement to require EBB operators to provide for electronic file downloading
using EDI, the Commission also required pipelines to make the data sets available in a standardized ASCII flat file
format in an effort to ease the transition to EDI for those not familiar with this technology. The Gas*Flow group, which
was to develop the EDI implementation guide, also was to provide the ASCII flat file formats.

 They contend the requirement for ASCII flat file downloads goes beyond the consensus agreement of Working Group 4,
which left the provision of ASCII flat file downloads up to the pipeline. They assert that imposing a redundant download
capability is costly and provides little benefit. Natural and INGAA contend the requirement is unjustified since
only two comments on the NOPR requested ASCII flat file downloads and the Commission failed to make an effort to estimate
the number of customers wanting to use ASCII flat files. Tenneco Gas maintains ASCII flat file downloads pose a risk
to the receiver of information, because they do not contain the safeguards inherent in the ASC X12 process. AER/MRT
assert the Commission should limit the requirement to provide ASCII flat file downloads to seven months, which will
provide a sufficient transition period while reducing the burden on the pipeline to maintain two formats indefinitely.
A number of parties also argue that Gas*Flow will not be supporting ASCII flat file standards because such an effort
goes beyond its charter.

Working Groups 1 &amp; 2, PEC Pipeline Group, TGPL, and Tenneco Gas suggest that, if the ASCII flat file requirement

Working Groups 1 &amp; 2 assert each pipeline should be responsible for defining its ASCII flat file in either a fixed

The Commission also has received filings from Working Group 3 and other parties arguing that while ASCII flat file

disadvantages when compared with ASC X12 communication.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The cited disadvantages of ASCII flat file downloads are: the ASCII flat file format itself is inefficient and inflexible,
because it relies on sequential data display; ASCII flat files are less reliable because validation programs are
available for ASC X12, but not for ASCII flat files; the lack of validation also makes using ASCII flat files more labor
intensive and expensive; and ASCII flat files do not provide a foundation for further standardization in the industry
as does ASC X12.

Although Enron Gas Services Corporation created an ASCII flat file format should the Commission wish to use it, neither
Enron nor Gas*Flow supports the use of ASCII downloads. Enron further states that requiring pipelines to provide
ASCII flat file downloads is not necessary even for users wanting to use a flat file format. It maintains that these
users can obtain commercially available software at low cost which will translate the ASC X12 information into an
ASCII flat file format.

</FOOTNOTE>

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
On reconsideration, the Commission agrees with those requesting rehearing that the future of electronic communications
in this industry will be better served by establishing one industry standard based on already established communication
protocols, such as ASC X12 EDI, rather than by developing a second system which is not based on recognized communication
standards and which would provide a less reliable method of communication. The provision of a transition period to
EDI does not warrant the expense of establishing a standardized ASCII download capability. Users that are not currently
EDI capable will still be able to use the EBBs to conduct capacity release transactions while they are learning EDI.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 In addition, ASCII flat files may be designed in different configurations depending on the customer's use for that
data. The Commission's specification of a particular format, therefore, would not necessarily have met customers'
needs.

Those pipelines that currently provide ASCII downloads in the pipeline's proprietary format must provide a grace

</FOOTNOTE>

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Moreover, the Commission's adoption of ASC X12 EDI standards for communication has created the foundation for software
vendors to develop specific software or other services which will convert the standardized ASC X12 EDI data into the
file structures needed by users, whether large or small. For example, in other industries, software vendors have
developed low-cost desktop EDI translators for personal computers that convert from EDI to a flat ASCII file structure
(a ``canned'' file structure) without the user having to understand EDI or learn how to program or operate the translator.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
33
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Commission is confident that all customers will be able to acquire software or other services that meet their individual
data communication needs at reasonable prices. Relying on the market to develop such services is preferable to the
Commission mandating a second file download structure that may not even provide a good fit with customers' needs.

B. Uploading and Subset Downloading 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In Order No. 563, the Commission stated that the ability of users to transmit (upload) capacity release files to the
pipelines' computers and to download subsets of files would enhance communication efficiency for capacity release
transactions. File upload capability would permit users to submit offers to release and bids without using the pipelines'
EBBs, while subset downloads would permit users to obtain only the capacity release files they need. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
KGPC contends the development of file uploads and subset downloads should be driven by market demand, so the pipeline
has some assurance its customers want the service before being compelled to provide it. Tenneco Gas suggests the development
of file uploads for capacity be delayed until after the upload capability being developed by the Working Groups for
nominations and confirmations is underway. It contends most industry participants at the Commission's conference
gave first priority to the development of upload capability for nominations and that upload capability for capacity
release, particularly for bids, is more difficult to develop. It also states upload capability should be market driven,
because the parties supplying the upload information are not pipelines. NGSA supports the development of file upload
and subset download capability and suggests this task is within the purview of Working Group 1, not Working Group 4
(as stated by the Commission). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In their March 4, 1994, filing, Working Groups 1 &amp; 2 provided data sets that would enable users to download subsets
of capacity release information and these have been adopted by the Commission. Working Groups 1 &amp; 2 have agreed
to report by June 1, 1994 on capacity release uploading and ask the Commission not to prejudge the issue. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Commission still is interested in the use of file uploads to facilitate capacity release by eliminating the need
for shippers and bidders to go through the process of signing-on to EBBs to submit offers and bids. But the Commission
will not require the Working Groups to go forward with this approach until Working Groups 1 &amp; 2 have the opportunity
to make their June 1, 1994 filing on this issue.

A. Common Company Codes 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In the NOPR, the Commission stated that it expected Working Group 5 to finalize its proposal for identifying companies
by use of a common code by February 1, 1994. In its March 24, 1994 report, the Working Group stated it has reached consensus
on a procedure for assigning company codes. The Working Group states that use of company names alone is unreliable
because different abbreviations and aliases would render electronic posting ineffective. The Working Group, therefore,
selected the D-U-N-S Number assigned to companies by the Dun &amp; Bradstreet Corporation as the common code number.
The Working Group states that Dun &amp; Bradstreet will assign a D-U-N-S number free of charge to any company that can
establish that it is a business entity located at a specific address and engaged in a legitimate business. Dun &amp;
Bradstreet also allows trading partners to exchange D-U-N-S numbers without charge and will provide the company
name and address corresponding to a D-U-N-S number to any other party requesting the information for internal use.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Working Group proposes that pipelines provide a means by which capacity release participants can provide common
code numbers to be used in EDI transactions involving the capacity release data sets. The participants would be solely
responsible for obtaining the common code numbers from Dun &amp; Bradstreet and providing them to the pipeline. Those
participants that do not have a D-U-N-S number would so inform the pipeline and only their company name would be included
in the data sets. The Working Group asserts this process would be self-implementing by the participants and would
not require any new institutional arrangements to implement.

The National Registry submitted comments stating that its understanding of the Working Group 5 agreement was that
any company having one or more D-U-N-S numbers would supply at least one valid D-U-N-S number to the pipeline. According
to the National Registry, the only exception to the requirement is when a company does not have a D-U-N-S number. The
National Registry further contends that D-U-N-S numbers should be included in any of the data sets when releaser or
bidder company name information is supplied. Great Lakes Gas Transmission Limited Partnership (Great Lakes) supports
the Working Group 5 proposal because parties can acquire D-U-N-S numbers at no charge and the use of D-U-N-S numbers
is self-implementing by capacity release participants. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Commission already has adopted the revised data sets submitted by Working Groups 1 &amp; 2 which contain fields
for display of D-U-N-S numbers. No further Commission action on this proposal seems required at this time. Those using
the EBB should provide the pipelines with their D-U-N-S numbers (if they have them) and the pipelines will display
those numbers on their EBBs and the downloadable data sets.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In Order No. 563, the Commission accepted the consensus approach proposed by Working Group 5 for identifying common
pipeline transaction points. Under this approach, a third-party code assignor, the Petroleum Information Corporation
(PI-GRID), will prepare a computerized cross-reference table correlating pipelines' proprietary codes (as verified
and updated by the pipelines) to a common code. Those wanting to use the common code will maintain the cross-reference
table on their computers and can convert proprietary pipeline codes to the common code, and 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
vice versa.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 All transactions with the pipeline will take place using the pipelines' proprietary codes. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In the communication protocols, the Commission required the pipelines to provide the validated computerized data
base by November 1, 1994. Pipelines were required to verify the required information about their transaction points
to the code assignor. The Commission also required each pipeline to provide the code assignor with sufficient information
to enable users to locate the position of each common code point on that pipeline in relation to other points, such as
by using geographic coordinates, line numbers, or line markers. In line with the Working Group proposal, the Commission
required the pipelines to ensure that users can obtain the common code data base from PI-GRID, and any updates, without
charge, except for reasonable distribution and handling fees.

1. Pipeline Responsibility To Provide the Data Base and Ensure Reasonable Fees 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Columbia Distribution contends the use of the common code translation table is an inefficient method of communicating
common codes. Instead, it maintains the Commission should require the pipelines to adopt the common code. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Several parties object to the Commission's requirement that the pipelines be responsible for ensuring that a validated
computerized base is available by November 1, 1994, and that the fees charged by PI-GRID are reasonable.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
34
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 They contend the Commission's requirements are at odds with the Working Group 5 process in which an industry consortium
would be negotiating and signing the contract with PI-GRID. TGPL argues that placing the compliance burden on the
pipelines gives PI-GRID unreasonable leverage in negotiating its duties as code assignor. TGPL asserts the Commission
should do nothing more than accept the Working Group 5 proposal and require the pipelines to validate their proprietary
point information to PI-GRID. KGPC suggests that the Commission set up a process to monitor the provision of services
by PI-GRID, rather than placing that burden on the pipelines. AER/MRT argues that instead of placing the burden on
the pipelines to ensure a November 1, 1994 implementation date, the Commission should set a compliance date for PI-GRID
and, if this deadline is not met, should give the pipelines additional time to comply with the common code requirements.

TGPL, Tenneco Gas, Natural, and KGPC contend that pipelines should not be responsible for ensuring the reasonableness
of fees because they will not be signatories to the contract with PI-GRID and, therefore, can have only an indirect
influence on the contracts. Natural further contends the requirement to ensure reasonable fees is unduly vague and
establishes no basis for determining when such costs are reasonable. INGAA maintains the industry consortium approach
of Working Group 5 provides a competitive market mechanism for controlling fees that is superior to imposing a requirement
on only one segment of the industry. INGAA points out that the contract with PI-GRID requires that PI-GRID make the
codes available at a cost covering only shipping and handling. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On the other hand, NGSA contends the Commission did not place sufficient requirements on the pipelines to ensure that
the November 1, 1994 implementation date is met. It suggests the Commission require the pipelines to cooperate with
the code assignor by designating, prior to a specified date, a pipeline liaison who will work with the code assignor
to establish and validate the transaction points. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Commission denies the request by Columbia Distribution to require the pipelines to adopt the common code. Such
a requirement goes beyond the consensus reached by the Working Group. The translation table provides users with the
benefits of common codes within a reasonable time frame, while, at the same time, pipelines need not incur the burden
and expense of making an immediate conversion of their computer systems and operations to accommodate the common
codes. However, as pipelines review and update their financial systems to accommodate the new business conditions
created by Order No. 636, the Commission fully expects them to incorporate the use of common codes.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Commission will clarify its position on pipeline responsibility. The Commission is accepting the code assignor
approach put forward by the Working Group. While the Commission recognizes that other parties have been involved
in developing the concept and will be signing the contract with PI-GRID, the pipelines are the only jurisdictional
entity involved in the transaction. The pipelines can fulfill their obligation by either individually, or through
their trade association INGAA, entering into the contract with PI-GRID as developed and presented by the Working
Groups. The Commission understands that this contract will specify that the charges for obtaining the common code
data base cannot exceed reasonable shipping and handling costs. The Commission, at this point, will leave the monitoring
of these costs to the signatories to the contract. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Commission has required the pipelines to confirm their proprietary point information to PI-GRID, and the Commission
expects no problems in pipeline cooperation with PI-GRID. However, to facilitate PI-GRID's development of the common
code data base, each pipeline must designate a liaison to work with PI-GRID and must cooperate with the schedule set
up by PI-GRID so that the data base will be available by the November 1, 1994 date.

2. Point Locator Information 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
TGPL and INGAA seek rehearing of the Commission's requirement that pipelines provide PI-GRID with information sufficient
to locate pipeline points in relation to other points. They argue the two comments to the NOPR requesting such information
do not provide a sufficient basis for the Commission to reject the consensus agreement of Working Group 5 under which
pipelines would provide this information only if they have it readily available. They maintain Working Group 5 treated
this information as optional to avoid imposing additional burdens on pipelines that do not maintain this information
in electronic form, while providing useful data when the information is readily available and accessible. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Commission denies the request to make point locator information optional. Shippers considering capacity release
offers need information about point location to determine whether a particular offer fits their needs. Point locator
information provides shippers with the ability to determine electronically whether the transportation path they
desire is encapsuled within the transportation path of the posted release. For instance, without such information,
the shipper cannot determine whether the delivery point it wants to use is upstream or downstream of the delivery point
on the capacity release offer. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Nevertheless, the Commission recognizes that some pipelines may have a large number of receipt points and may not
maintain the geographic location of these points in an easily accessible form. The Commission also considers the
geographic location of delivery points to be more important to evaluating capacity release offers than receipt point
information, because the potential bidder generally needs only to determine whether the path of the capacity release
offer extends to its desired delivery point. To ease the burden on those pipelines without easily accessible information,
the Commission will require that they confirm to PI-GRID the geographic location of their delivery points and most
important receipt points in time to meet the November 1, 1994 deadline. Those pipelines would then be responsible
for completing the confirmation process for all their receipt points as soon as possible, but no later than May 1, 1995.
Pipelines desiring to take advantage of this exception should file a request for an extension of time, explaining
their system for maintaining geographic information and justifying their inability to make full compliance by November
1, 1994. Such extensions will be granted only upon good cause shown.

KGPC requests clarification that the Commission's reference to geographic coordinates referred to latitude and
longitude. The Commission agrees. Natural states that its paper pooling and storage points used for nominations
have no identifiable location on the pipeline and it presumes that for such points, it need only include an identifier
showing the points have no geographical location. Pipelines should consult with PI-GRID to determine how to report
points without identifiable geographic locations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The National Registry states that most pipelines appear to be cooperating with the requirement to provide point locator
information in a form that will enable users to locate points in relation to each other. It requests clarification
that the Commission's complaint process is the appropriate means of dealing with possible situations in which pipelines
do not provide the point locator information in usable form. The Commission does not anticipate that any problems
will develop, but, if they do, an attempt should be made to resolve the problem through the Working Group, and, if that
fails, the Commission's complaint procedure or enforcement hotline would be appropriate vehicles for pursuing
a problem.

3. Establishment of New Receipt and Delivery Points 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In the final rule, the Commission adopted the agreement reached by Working Group 5 that information concerning new
receipt and delivery points, or modifications to existing points, must be provided to the code assignor 10 days before
any business will be transacted using the new or modified point. Natural requests clarification that shippers may
utilize a new receipt or delivery point prior to the expiration of the 10-day period. It contends situations arise
in which a shipper has an immediate need for a new receipt or delivery point and a 10-day delay would pose an unnecessary
hardship. It also argues pipelines sometimes need to add a point immediately, for example, to identify a second proprietary
code for an existing point or create a paper point for accounting purposes. It suggests that no more than a one day delay
in implementing points should be mandated. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The requirement for a delay in implementing points was intended to ensure that parties using the common code data base
would not be at a disadvantage to those using the pipelines' proprietary points as listed on the EBB. Except in emergency
situations, pipelines should give 
<!-- PJG 0034 unknown -->
PI-GRID at least 10 days advance notice of new points or modifications to point information so that those using the
common code data base will not be disadvantaged relative to those using the pipeline's EBB.

VII. Additional Standards 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Parties had requested that the Commission require an electronic Index of Purchasers, which would disclose information
about capacity rights, and require the development of standards for non-capacity release business transactions.
The Working Groups were continuing their deliberations in these areas, and, in Order No. 563, the Commission stated
that it would await the Working Group reports before making decisions on these issues. The Working Groups have submitted
reports on these issues. Several rehearing petitions address these issues as do comments received on the Working
Group reports, and the Commission will address these issues below. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
A. Index Of Purchasers 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The National Registry and Gaslantic support the so-called Tennessee compromise being developed by the Working Groups,
but, in the event the compromise falls through, the National Registry requests the Commission to grant rehearing
and require the pipelines to implement the limited Index the National Registry proposes. KGPC suggests that, if an
electronic Index of Purchasers is required, the Commission should eliminate or modify its current regulations that
require pipelines to file similar information with the Commission. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Working Groups 1 &amp; 2 failed to reach consensus on an Index. One group, consisting of 44 participants drawn from
a cross-section of the industry (Group 1),
<FOOTCITE>36</FOOTCITE>
 support a compromise proposal under which the Commission would eliminate the paper reporting requirements relating
to firm and interruptible transportation, including the initial and subsequent reports (but not the annual reports
or the reports on bypasses) and the requirement to include an Index of Purchasers in a pipeline's tariff. These reports
would be replaced by an electronic Index provided in downloadable form consisting of the following nine data elements
for each firm transportation and storage shipper: shipper's name, contract identifier, rate schedule, contract
start date, contract end date, contract quantity, receipt points (and associated maximum daily quantities (MDQs)),
delivery points (and associated MDQs), and conjunctive restrictions, if any.
<FOOTCITE>37</FOOTCITE>
 The information would be updated whenever a new contract for firm capacity was written or a pipeline filed a section
4(e) rate case.

Conjunctive restrictions were undefined in the proposal. According to the comment by the National Registry, one
of the signatories to the agreement, conjunctive restrictions are provisions that operate across multiple points
or contracts and may limit a shipper's rights at a particular receipt or delivery point. It gives as an example a shipper
with stated rights 2,000 MDQs at three points, but a restriction that it cannot ship more than a total of 2,500 MDQ's
from all three points on a single day.

They assert that those seeking the Index claim that it will help users locate available firm capacity. But the group
argues that an Index is not needed for this purpose because firm capacity holders have every incentive to post their
available firm capacity and shippers seeking capacity can post ``want ads'' advertising their need for capacity.

The Arkla Companies
<FOOTCITE>40</FOOTCITE>
 oppose any Index. They assert the justification given for the Index (that it is needed so capacity buyers can locate
available capacity) is unsupported. They argue that this function is satisfied by the firm shipper's incentive to
release capacity and potential buyers' ability to place ``want ads'' advertising their interest in acquiring capacity.
If firm shippers, not already posting firm capacity, fail to respond to a ``want ad,'' the Arkla Companies maintain
the capacity holder is unlikely to be interested in releasing capacity. Further, they assert that small users (who
are alleged to be at an information disadvantage to large users) would not likely be sophisticated enough to manipulate
the data on the thousands of contracts electronically available through the Index. If the Commission does require
an Index, they maintain the Commission should eliminate its Part 284 reporting requirements and permit the pipelines
to charge a fee for the use of the Index.

Public notice of these filings was given on March 3, 1994, and the National Registry and PEC Pipeline Group filed comments
supporting Group 1's proposal containing the nine data elements. The National Registry contends the information
on receipt and delivery point MDQs is needed so the market can be aware of receipt and delivery point capacity that can
be acquired through capacity release. It points out that many pipelines allocate greater firm receipt and delivery
point capacity than they do mainline capacity and shippers may want to acquire the receipt or delivery point capacity
independently of mainline capacity.
<FOOTCITE>41</FOOTCITE>
 In response to those opposing disclosure of receipt and delivery point information, the National Registry contends
that capacity information should not be considered proprietary. It also argues that disclosure of receipt points
is unlikely to reveal a purchaser's gas purchase strategy, since it does not disclose pricing, duration, or delivery
conditions and, in most cases, even the supplier could not be divined from the information.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The PEC Pipeline Group supports the Group 1 proposal because this option actually will reduce costs by eliminating
the duplicate reporting requirements for firm transportation contracts. It points out that the information required
by the Index is essentially the same as is now required to be filed in the initial and subsequent reports under Part 284,
so no additional costs for gathering the information are created by the proposal. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Commission finds that the Group 1, more inclusive, proposal has significant merit, and the Commission is very
interested in pursuing this proposal further. The proposal provides useful information to the market about capacity,
while also setting the stage for reducing filing burdens on pipelines and streamlining the Commission's reporting
requirements. The Group 2, more limited, proposal is not as attractive because, without receipt and delivery point
information, it would not reduce filing burdens. Moreover, information on receipt and delivery points would be of
value to those seeking releasable capacity and disclosure of such capacity information is not confidential, since
it presently is disclosed publicly through the initial and subsequent reports. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Commission, however, is unsure about some details of the proposal. For example, as framed, it would eliminate
the initial and subsequent reports for firm and interruptible transportation, but would provide only information
about firm transportation in the electronic Index. The proposed Index would be updated only when a new contract was
written or upon the filing of a section 4 rate case, whereas the subsequent reports now must be filed whenever a material
change in the contract occurs. The proposal states that the Index would be available in downloadable form, but does
not specify the format for the download (EDI or another format) nor whether shippers will have access to the information
in other forms. In addition, the proposal does not discuss how the information will be archived in the event access
to historical data is needed. The Commission staff and the Working Group, therefore, should work to develop a final
proposal to be provided to the Commission by September 30, 1994.

B. Business Practice Standards 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In Order No. 563, the Commission concluded that standardization of business transactions unrelated to capacity
release should be the next step in the standardization process. Working Group 3 had been considering such standards
and had identified 33 high priority items, of which ten were considered most critical.
<FOOTCITE>42</FOOTCITE>
 The Commission found that standardization of these ten, or most of them, provided a good departure point for this effort.
The Commission stated that the Working Group should propose an appropriate implementation schedule for the ten identified
data elements. The Working Group also was to continue its efforts to identify which of the remaining 23 high priority
data elements, as well as any others, require standardization and propose a schedule for implementation of standards
for these elements as well.

PEC Pipeline Group contends the Commission should not be issuing mandatory standards for non-capacity release transactions.
It asserts mandatory standards for such transactions would be inconsistent with the Commission's position in restructuring
orders that Order No. 636 required only the posting of information related to available capacity and not information
on nominations, scheduling, and gas flow. PEC Pipeline Group and Tenneco Gas assert that implementation of non-capacity
release standards should be determined by the market, not regulation. Tenneco Gas also states that the industry is
working on standardization related to nominations and that these standards should be reviewed first before additional
standardization is attempted. Natural seeks clarification that the Commission is not prejudging or dictating the
items to be standardized, but is relying on Working Group 3 to make this determination. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On the other side, NGC and NGSA contend the Working Groups are deadlocked on whether pipelines should be required to
implement the high priority data elements. They contend the Commission should direct the pipelines, in conjunction
with Working Group 3, to develop an implementation schedule for all 33 high priority data elements. NGC suggests that
the schedule for the ten high priority items should be submitted by April 1, 1994 and for the remaining 23 by June 1, 1994.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On March 25, 1994, Working Group 3 filed a consensus agreement regarding the development of standards for non-capacity
release business transactions. They anticipate completion of 12 upload and download data sets relating to confirmations
and nominations by June 1, 1994.

 At the time of the filing, 55 trading partners, including a number of pipelines, have committed to begin implementation
of these data sets in June 1994, with pilot testing by December 31, 1994. Several pipelines and their trading partners
are expected to be in full implementation by January 1995. The Working Group encourages other industry participants
that are EDI capable to support these data sets by September 1995.

Working Group 3 anticipates it will complete its consideration of the other high priority data sets by January 1, 1995,
with development of data sets by January 1, 1996 and implementation within the 6 month period from January to June,
1996. The Group states this schedule may be affected by the Group's analysis of the transactions involved and its evaluation
of the use of EDI for capacity release and for nominations and confirmations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The consensus of Working Group 3 was that significant and sufficient progress can be made in developing and implementing
these standards without the Commission mandating implementation. It, therefore, recommends that the Commission
accept the consensus agreement without mandating compliance with the data sets by the pipelines.

Although the Commission began the standardization process with capacity release, the Commission recognizes that
the process now needs to be expanded to include other business practices in order to facilitate the movement of gas
across multiple pipelines. In addition to standards governing electronic communication, such standards could
include other business practices, such as standardization of gas days and nomination times to help shippers schedule
deliveries across multiple pipelines. The Working Group's use of a pilot program, implemented as quickly as possible,
appears to be a worthwhile approach for assessing the value of proposed standards and approaches, so that lessons
learned can be applied to other areas and the process can move forward quickly. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
At this point, the Commission will honor the consensus agreement of Working Group 3 and allow the industry to proceed
in developing such standards, without Commission mandate. The Commission applauds the progress of the industry
to date and hopes that a consensus can be achieved on implementing the nomination/confirmation standards on schedule
as well as implementing the additional proposed standards by the targeted dates if not earlier. The Commission also
recognizes that other efforts are underway in the industry to standardize business practices. The Working Group
should keep abreast of these developments and coordinate these efforts. The Commission staff will continue to actively
monitor the Working Group's progress in developing these standards. Depending on the progress made by the industry
in this endeavor, the Commission will evaluate the need for mandating compliance with such standards either in this
docket or in another appropriate forum.

VIII. Recovery Of EBB Costs 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In Order No. 563, the Commission responded to comments addressing the mechanism for recovering the costs of standardization.
As a general matter, the Commission stated that its policy of permitting recovery of fixed costs through a reservation
charge and variable costs through a usage charge was appropriate for the basic EBB service, which would include the
downloadable data sets and communication protocols of this rule. The Commission stated that these services should
be included in the basic EBB package because they were needed to provide a viable capacity release market and would
provide system-wide benefits to all users. For enhancements to the basic EBB package, the Commission stated it was
open to cost recovery approaches that would recover fixed costs from the limited number of users deriving benefit
from the service.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
KGPC states that EBB implementation and development costs should be recovered as fixed costs. Columbia Distribution
and UDC/AGD, on the other hand, object to the Commission's statement that the fixed costs of the basic EBB package should
be recovered through reservation charges. They assert the Commission's statement is at odds with its statement in
the NOPR that it would be open to cost recovery methods that would spread costs across all those benefitting from the
standards. Edison similarly contends that ``data aggregators'' (companies which are not shippers on pipelines,
but which will be downloading data from multiple EBBs to provide electronic services) should pay their share of the
costs for additional services provided at their request. All three contend the Commission should adopt a policy on
cost recovery under which the costs would be equitably shared among all users of EBBs with the precise method of cost
allocation determined in section 4 rate proceedings. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
UDC/AGD also request clarification of the criteria the Commission will use to determine which enhancements are not
to be included in the basic EBB package. They state, for example, that some of the non-capacity release standards which
the Working Groups are developing may not be of general benefit. KGPC suggests that any standards imposed by the Commission
should be treated as part of the standard EBB service. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Columbia Distribution and UDC/AGD further assert the Commission's statement on cost recovery could interfere with
the development of alternative cost recovery approaches by the Working Groups, and UDC/AGD contend that if the Commission
does not revisit this issue, it should, at least, refer the issue to the Working Groups for further consideration.
In contrast, NGSA contends that the method of cost recovery is a policy issue outside the scope of this proceeding and
that the Working Groups should not be asked to resolve this issue since they are set up to deal with technical issues.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
NGC requests clarification that all cost recovery related to EBBs will take place in full section 4 rate cases so that
savings as well as costs can be taken into account. NGC further argues that variable costs should not be recovered through
usage charges because a usage charge ignores the system-wide benefits of EBBs and other forms of electronic nominations.
If the Commission does permit a separate charge for EBB use, NGC contends the Commission should not permit EDI users
to be singled out for separate charges. NGC maintains that some in the industry have argued for a separate charge for
EDI users because not all users find EDI suitable. NGC responds that some users find on-line EBBs equally unsuitable.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As part of the Working Groups 1 &amp; 2 report, position papers were filed reiterating the points made above. One group

47
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 supports an equitable sharing of costs by all EBB users. They assert that if firm capacity holders are required to pay
all EBB costs through a reservation charge, the firm holders will be subsidizing other users of the system. They further
assert that having to absorb all EBB costs will place firm users at a competitive disadvantage compared with brokers
and marketers that can obtain the EBB services at no cost. This group asserts the Commission state that its policy is
to equitably share costs, with the mechanics of the cost sharing approach to be developed in section 4 cases, in which
the parties could consider a number of options, such as annual user fees or on-line usage charges.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Commission recognizes that those supporting cost sharing raise a legitimate concern that users should be responsible
for paying the costs that their use imposes on the system. On the other hand, in Order No. 636&hyph;A, the Commission
rejected a user fee approach to EBB cost recovery in favor of a reservation charge approach out of concern about potential
consequences of user fees. The Commission intended EBBs to provide for wide dispersion of information about capacity
availability as well as information concerning market and system operational information. In fact, to further the
secondary capacity market, the Commission has sought to remove impediments to the development of services by third
parties that would aggregate information from multiple pipeline EBBs, thereby improving access to information.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
50
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Commission, therefore, rejected user fees for EBBs because high user fees can work to the disadvantage of firm
shippers by discouraging the use of EBBs for capacity release transactions and by providing advantages to the pipelines'
sale of interruptible transportation at the expense of capacity release.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
51
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Without more detail about how cost sharing would work, the Commission cannot endorse a policy of equitable cost sharing
at this point. The Commission, however, is not ruling out adoption of a fully supported and justified proposal of this
nature. At this point, these issues are best examined in the context of an individual rate case.

Similarly, the Commission does not have sufficient basis to establish a generic standard for cost recovery for enhancements
to the basic EBB package. All the standards the Commission has adopted are of sufficient system-wide benefit to be
included in the basic EBB package. Also, as discussed above, the Commission will not be mandating implementation
of the non-capacity release standards proposed by Working Group 3 at this time. The Working Group is proposing a pilot
program to evaluate its efforts, so an attempt to develop a generic cost recovery approach for these standards is premature.
At this point, cost recovery for implementation of the standards is best addressed in individual rate cases. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Commission agrees with NGSA that cost recovery is a policy issue that need not be resolved by the Working Groups,
and the Working Groups should not permit debates over cost recovery to side-track them from their work on developing
standards. If parties have developed concrete proposals for alternate methods of cost recovery for particular standards,
they can submit the proposals in comments on the Working Group reports or address the issue in individual section 4
cases in which EBB cost recovery is an issue.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
FDA is correcting certain errors that have been incorporated into the biologics regulations in parts 606 and 660 (21
CFR parts 606 and 660). The errors in the regulations are as follows:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
1. In the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 of April 19, 1988 (53 FR 12760), FDA changed the name of ``Blood Grouping Serum'' to ``Blood Grouping Reagent'' to more
accurately describe the product's derivation and intended use. However, in &sect;&sect; 606.65(c) and 606.121(c)(12)(i),
(c)(12)(ii), and (c)(12)(iii), the name change was inadvertently omitted. The agency is correcting these errors.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. In the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 of February 11, 1985 (50 FR 5574), FDA changed the name of ``Anti-Human Serum'' to ``Anti-Human Globulin'' to reflect
that this product may be produced from immunoglobulin-secreting cell lines as well as from serum. However, in  606.65(c),
the name change was inadvertently omitted. The agency is correcting this error. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. Further, in &sect;660.28(a), the agency is revising the blood group antibody designations ``Anti-c,'' and ``Anti-k,''
as ``Anti-,'' and ``Anti-,''respectively.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Publication of this document constitutes final action on these changes under the Administrative Procedure Act (5
U.S.C. 553). Notice and public procedure and delayed effective date on this final rule are unnecessary because the
changes are editorial in nature and nonsubstantive (5 U.S.C. 553(b) and (d)).

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
The Controlled Substances Act (CSA) (21 U.S.C. 801 set seq.) establishes a detailed regulatory scheme governing
the manufacture and distribution of controlled substances and listed chemicals. The CSA requires that every person
who manufactures, distributes, or dispenses a controlled substance or who manufactures, distributes, exports
or imports certain listed chemicals must obtain a registration from DEA. An application for such registration may
be denied or a registration revoked pursuant to specific provisions of the CSA.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Attorney General has delegated her functions under the CSA to the Administrator of the Drug Enforcement Administration.
See 21 U.S.C. 871(a) and 28 CFR 0.100(b). Regulations implementing the CSA empower the Administrator, for example,
to issue final orders to deny applications for registration or revoke registrations, to schedule controlled substances,
to designate chemicals as listed chemicals and to establish quotas.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Attorney General has also authorized the Administrator to redelegate any of his functions under the CSA to any
of his subordinates. See 28 CFR 0.104. To further enhance the administration of the CSA and its attendant regulations,
the Administrator is redelegating to the Deputy Administrator the authority to exercise all necessary functions
under 21 CFR part 1300 which have not already been redelegated in subpart R of 28 CFR 0.104. This redelegation will empower
the Deputy Administrator, among other things, to issue final orders relating to the suspension, denial or revocation
of registration, scheduling actions, designation of chemicals as listed chemicals, establishment of production
quotas for certain controlled substances, and to grant or deny waivers of CSA regulations relating to registrants.
This redelegation will include the authority to exercise all regulatory functions which may be delegated to the Administrator
in the future pursuant to subsequent amendments to 21 CFR part 1300 and not otherwise specifically assigned or reserved
by the Administrator.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Administrator certifies that this action will have no impact upon entities whose interests must be considered
under the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601). Pursuant to Executive Order 12866, this is not a significant
regulatory action since it relates only to the organization of functions within DEA. Accordingly, it has not been
reviewed by the Office of Management and Budget and does not require certification under Executive Order 12778. This
action has been analyzed in accordance with Executive Order 12616. It has been determined that this matter has no federalism
implications which would warrant the preparation of a federalism assessment.

The effective date of the interim final rule was March 16, 1994. No comments were received during the 60-day comment

 NMFS announces a change in the trip limit for rockfish taken with set nets in the open access fishery for groundfish
in the U.S. exclusive economic zone off the coast of California as authorized by the Pacific Coast Groundfish Fishery
Management Plan (FMP). This action is intended to keep landings as close as possible to the open access allocation
without causing excessive discards. Clarifications to the management measures for 1994 also are announced. The
clarifications do not result in changes to Federal management of the fishery.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 At its April 4&hyph;8, 1994, meeting in Burlingame, CA, the Council recommended changes to the 1994 groundfish fishery
specifications and management measures published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 at 59 FR 685, on January 6, 1994. NMFS concurs with the Council's recommendations, and herein announces the following
changes and clarifications for the reasons stated below. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
A. Change the Open Access Trip Limit for Rockfish Caught With Set Nets
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The current trip limit for all open access gear except exempted trawl gear is 10,000 pounds (4,536 kg) per trip for all
rockfish combined, not to exceed 40,000 pounds (18,144 kg) cumulative in a month. Representatives of the California
set net fleet testified that they frequently catch more than 10,000 pounds (4,536 kg) per trip, resulting in significant
discards. The Council agreed that the 10,000-pound (4,536 kg) trip limit could be removed for the set net fishery to
minimize discards and disruption of traditional fishing patterns, but the 40,000 pound (18,144 kg) cumulative limit
per month must remain in effect. No change was recommended for any other open access gear because these gears have different
fishing patterns and the per trip limit is not as likely to cause discards. Data are inadequate at this time to determine
landings by the set net fishery or to project whether the open access allocation for rockfish will be reached before
the end of the year. The set net fishery is expected to take about 20 percent of the open access allocation of rockfish.
The Council agreed that the 10,000-pound (4,536 kg) trip limit may be inappropriate for this sector of the industry
if large levels of discards are occurring, but warned that more severe restrictions will be implemented later in the
year if necessary to avoid exceeding the open access allocation. Set nets are legal gear only south of 38

The revised trip limit modifies the document published on January 6, 1994 (59 FR 697), at paragraph IV.G.(1)(a), as
follows:

G. Vessel Limits in the Open-Access Fishery
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(1) Set net, hook-and-line, pot, and other exempt gear except exempted trawl gear:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(a) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Rockfish.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 No more than 40,000 pounds (18,144 kg) cumulative of rockfish may be taken and retained, possessed, or landed per vessel
per month. No more than 10,000 pounds (4,536 kg) of rockfish may be taken and retained, possessed, or landed per vessel
per fishing trip, unless caught with a set net, in which case the 10,000-pound (4,536 kg) trip limit does not apply.
Rockfish means the Sebastes complex (including yellowtail rockfish), shortbelly rockfish, widow rockfish, Pacific
ocean perch, and thornyheads, as listed at 50 CFR 663.2. Within these limits, a vessel may not take and retain, possess
or land more widow rockfish, Pacific ocean perch, thornyheads, DTS complex, Sebastes complex, yellowtail rockfish,
or bocaccio than authorized for the limited-entry fishery. (See paragraphs B.(1), C.(2), D.(1), and E.(3).)
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
B. Clarify the Provision for ``Fishing Ahead'' on the Next Limit
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Some confusion has arisen regarding the provision at 59 FR 695, paragraph IV.A.(4), that allows a vessel that already
has landed its cumulative or daily limit for a species to ``fish ahead'' on its limit for the next cumulative or daily
period. Some vessels would off-load part of their catch, keeping trip limit species on board for offloading after
the next legal period begins. This is not permitted because, if a vessel off-loads any fish, all fish on board count
toward the limit for the current period. The definition of ``landing'' at 50 CFR 663.2 states that ``once transfer
begins, all fish aboard the vessel are counted as part of the landing.'' Therefore, if a vessel off-loads any species
of fish (including groundfish with no trip limits, shrimp, prawns or other nongroundfish species) while having on
board a species or species group whose cumulative (or daily) limit has been reached, the fish on board will be counted
toward the current period's cumulative or daily limit, which then is exceeded. Paragraph IV.A.(4) is clarified as
follows:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) Unless the fishery is closed, a vessel which has landed its cumulative or daily limit may continue to fish on the
limit for the next legal period so long as no fish (including but not limited to groundfish with no trip limits, shrimp,
prawns or other nongroundfish species or shellfish) are landed (offloaded) until the next legal period. As stated
in the regulations at 50 CFR 663.2, once offloading of any species begins, all fish aboard the vessel are counted as
part of the landing.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
C. Clarify the Calculation of the Sablefish Trawl Trip Limit
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Council originally recommended a sablefish trip limit of 25 percent of the DTS complex (Dover sole, thornyheads,
and trawl-caught sablefish). This has caused some confusion. The legal limit for sablefish is difficult to determine
because it is based on the total amount of legal DTS complex, including sablefish. To simplify this trip limit, NMFS
is restating it in equivalent terms that are easier to calculate_25 percent of the DTS complex (including sablefish)
is equivalent to 33.333 percent (approximately one third) of the legal thornyheads and Dover sole (i.e. the DTS complex
excluding sablefish). Paragraph IV.E.(3)(b)(ii), at 59 FR 696, is restated below:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Trip and Size Limits
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
_(ii) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Trip limits.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Coastwide, no more than 50,000 pounds (22,680 kg) cumulative of the DTS complex may be taken and retained, possessed,
or landed per vessel per month. Within this 50,000 pounds (22,680 kg), no more than 30,000 pounds (13,608 kg) cumulative
may be thornyheads, and no more than 12,000 pounds (5,443 kg) cumulative may be trawl-caught sablefish. In any landing
of the DTS complex, the trip limit for trawl-caught sablefish is 1,000 pounds (454 kg), or 33.333 percent of the legal
thornyheads and Dover sole, whichever is greater. In any landing, no more than 5,000 pounds (2,268 kg) of sablefish
may be smaller than 22 inches (56 cm) (total length).

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=4 -->
Note:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
 33.333 percent of thornyheads and Dover sole (the DTS complex excluding sablefish) is equivalent to 25 percent of
the DTS complex (including sablefish). As stated in paragraph A.(6), at 59 FR 695, percentages are based on round weights,
and, unless otherwise specified, apply only to legal fish on board.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Federal trip limits for yellowtail rockfish are found at 59 FR 695, paragraph IV.C. The States of Oregon and Washington
have implemented declaration procedures that enable vessels that transit or operate north of Cape Lookout (where
the trip limit currently is 14,000 pounds (6,350 kg) cumulative of yellowtail rockfish per month) to fish south of
Cape Lookout and retain up to the southern limit (currently 30,000 pounds (13,608 kg) cumulative per month). Details
of the declaration procedure are set forth in the respective state regulations. Therefore, specific descriptions
of state requirements are being removed from the

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 notice at 59 FR 696 by deleting the following sentence from paragraph IV.C.(2)(c): ``For any vessel that takes and
retains or lands yellowtail rockfish during the month, a declaration must be filed for each fishing trip that crosses
the line at Cape Lookout during that month, must be made before leaving port on the fishing trip, and may not be changed
once the vessel has left port.'' In the same paragraph, the reference to the ``Washington Department of Fisheries''
is changed to the ``Washington Department of Fish and Wildlife''.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The other provisions at 59 FR 695, paragraph IV.C., that apply to vessels landing yellowtail rockfish are not changed.
Vessel operators are cautioned that the States of Oregon and Washington are in the process of revising their requirements,
and therefore the state where the fish will be landed should be contacted to ensure compliance with state law (Oregon
Department of Fish and Wildlife, Newport, OR at 503&hyph;867&hyph;4741 or 503&hyph;867&hyph;0300; or Washington
Department of Fish and Wildlife, Montesano WA, 206&hyph;249&hyph;4628).

E. Clarification of Yellowtail Rockfish Areas
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Two errors occurred in the 1994 groundfish fishery specifications and management measures in the description of
the stock assessment and harvest guideline areas for yellowtail rockfish. The clarifications, explained below,
cause no change in management of the fishery. (1) Footnote ``p'' to Table 1 at 59 FR 689 incorrectly states that the stock
assessment for yellowtail rockfish divides the Columbia area at Cape Lookout, OR. The geographic scope of the yellowtail
rockfish acceptable biological catch (ABC) is correctly described at 59 FR 690 in the third column_ABCs were determined
for the areas north and south of Cape Falcon, OR. Therefore, the first sentence of footnote ``p'' should read: ``The
yellowtail rockfish assessment addresses three separate areas: Vancouver, Columbia north of Cape Falcon, and Columbia
south of Cape Falcon plus Eureka.'' (2) The text in the first column at 59 FR 691 incorrectly states that the harvest
guidelines for yellowtail rockfish apply to the areas north and south of Cape Falcon. Cape Falcon divides a major fishing
ground, making differential trip limits on either side of the line impractical. Instead, Cape Lookout, OR, which
is 26 nautical miles south of Cape Falcon, was used for purposes of establishing the yellowtail rockfish harvest guidelines.
Therefore, the harvest guidelines and trip limits for yellowtail rockfish apply north and south of Cape Lookout,
as previously announced at 59 FR 687, Table 1, and at 59 FR 695, paragraph IV.C.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Background 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Commission's regulations currently require that independent reviews and audits of each licensee's safeguards
contingency plan and security program be conducted every 12 months by personnel who have no direct responsibility
for the subject areas. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The NRC is considering rulemaking in several program areas that would modify audit requirements so that the frequency,
scope, and depth of auditing activities would be based on review of program performance indicators but would not exceed
a 36-month interval to accomplish an audit of all program elements. Final NRC action on this petition would be consistent
with actions taken on modifications to other program audit requirements. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
Petitioner's Request 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Virginia Power requests that the NRC amend its regulations in 10 CFR parts 50 and 73 to change the requirements that
each licensee provide for a review at least every 12 months (annually) of its safeguards contingency plan and security
programs to nominally every 24 months (biennially). The petitioner also requests that appendix C to 10 CFR part 73
be amended to change the requirement that each licensee provide for a review and audit of its safeguards contingency
plan at intervals not to exceed 12 months to a frequency of 24 months. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The petitioner states that the proposed amendments would require each licensee to conduct independent reviews and
audits of its safeguards contingency plan and security program at least biennially. The petitioner states that the
resources presently used for audits in each area could be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reallocated if justified by performance to address more safety-significant concerns that might be identified.
The petitioner also states that the proposed audit frequency provides a greater degree of flexibility in applying
resources, thereby permitting a licensee to implement a more performance-based audit program. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
Grounds for Request 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The petitioner states that the changes requested are identified as present requirements that are resource intensive
but of marginal importance to safety. The petitioner offers the following reasons for the request.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
1. The underlying purpose of the requirements is to overview and ensure effective implementation of security programs.
Given the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
available objective criteria that industry performance is commendable in this area, aggressive overview activities
do not seem to be warranted. Resources, which previously would have been 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
strictly dedicated to the conduct of mandatory audits, could now be more effectively used to address performance
issues having safety significance. Biennial audits are sufficient to provide an acceptable, formal confirmation
of security program implementation. The underlying purpose of the existing requirement will continue to be met by
the proposed rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. The current industry Systematic Assessment of Licensee Performance (SALP) average for the security category
is 1.27 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
as of October 15, 1993. Clearly, this represents a commendable overall performance in this area and supports the move
to biennial 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
audits which can be supplemented as performance warrants. Based on the overall industry SALP ratings concerning
safeguards contingency plan and security program effectiveness, Virginia Power concludes that changing the audit
frequency to two years will have no adverse impact on implementation of the plan and program. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. A two-year audit schedule would permit the licensee an increased degree of flexibility to concentrate available
audit resources in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
areas of observed weakness based on performance rather than conducting a mandatory annual audit of marginal safety
significance. Thus, personnel resources would be allowed to address and resolve issues having greater safety significance.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. Regulatory Guide 1.33, Quality Assurance Program Requirements (Operation), prescribes a two-year audit frequency
for most operational phase activities commensurate with the activity's operational safety significance. The proposed
rule would be consistent with this previously defined regulatory position and the present safety significance as
evidenced by industry performance. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
5. The requirements to conduct annual audits are not of themselves necessary to achieve the underlying purpose of
10 CFR 50.54(p) and 10 CFR part 73. Biennial audits are sufficient to provide an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
acceptable formal confirmation of program effectiveness.

Supporting Information 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The petitioner states that the regulations that require licensees to implement safeguards contingency plans and
security programs are essential to ensure operation of the facilities in an environment free from external threats.
The petitioner notes that independent audits of these programs are required to overview their effectiveness. Furthermore,
the petitioner believes that the frequency or extent of overview of these plans and programs by mandatory audits is
not providing a commensurate performance in security programs. According to the petitioner, safeguards contingency
plans and security programs have been in place in the industry for an extended period and that despite recent reconsideration
of the design basis threat, nuclear security is otherwise being adequately addressed and implemented by the plans
and programs as they are presently configured. The petitioner believes that a biennial audit frequency would more
than adequately provide the requisite feedback and assurance regarding the effectiveness of each licensee's safeguards
contingency plan and security program. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The petitioner further states that technological advancements and applications have resulted in and will continue
to generate improvements to security equipment and facilities. The petitioner asserts that industry-wide programmatic
enhancements continue to be made available to improve the effective utilization of security staff as well as equipment
and that the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
results of the improvements to equipment and facilities and programmatic enhancements within nuclear safeguards
and security programs over the past decade have elevated plan effectiveness throughout the industry. The petitioner
notes that the improvement is evidenced, in part, through the SALP program which is used to assess security indicators.

(3) The licensee shall provide for the development, revision, implementation, and maintenance of its safeguards
contingency plan. To this end, the licensee shall provide for a review nominally every 24 months of the safeguards
contingency plan by individuals independent of both security program management and personnel who have direct responsibility
for implementation of the security program. The review must include a review and audit of safeguards contingency
procedures and practices, an audit of the security system testing and maintenance program, and a test of the safeguards
systems, along with commitments established for response by local law enforcement authorities. The results of the
review and audit, along with recommendations for improvements, must be documented, reported to the licensee's corporate
and plant management, and kept available at the plant for inspection for a period of three years.

program review must include an audit of security procedures and practices, an evaluation of the effectiveness of
the physical protection system, an audit of the physical protection system testing and maintenance program, and
an audit of commitments established for response by 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
local law enforcement authorities. The results and recommendations of the security program review, management's
findings on whether the security program is currently effective, and any actions taken as a result of recommendations
from prior program reviews must be documented in a report to the licensee's plant manager and to corporate management
at least one level higher than that having responsibility for the day-to-day plant operation. These reports must
be maintained in an auditable form, available for inspection, for a period of three years.

The petitioner states that this petition for rulemaking merely allows successful, existing functions to continue
without formal review at a frequency of nominally every two years rather than once per 12 months. The petitioner states
that the annual audit frequency is not necessary to ensure an adequate safeguards contingency plan and security program,
nor is it 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
commensurate with present industry performance in this area. Further, the petitioner states that it is not required
to support NRC evaluation of program adequacy.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 -->
SUMMARY: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
This action would modify the official description of the Class D airspace associated with the Cherry Capital Airport,
Traverse City, Michigan, by adding the phrase: ``This Class D airspace area is effective during the specific dates
and times established in advance by a Notice to Airmen. The effective date and time will thereafter be continuously
published in the Airport Facility Director.'' On September 18, 1993, Airspace Reclassification discontinued the
use of the terms ``control zone'' and ``airport traffic area.'' Airspace designated from the surface for an airport
where there is an operating control tower is now Class D airspace. The intended effect of this action is to allow a variation
of Class D airspace effective times to coincide with the operating hours of the Traverse City, Michigan, Airport Traffic
Control Tower at Cherry Capital Airport.

The Proposal
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
The FAA is considering an amendment to part 71 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR part 71) to modify the official
description of the Class D airspace associated with the Cherry Capital Airport, Traverse City, Michigan. The purpose
of this proposed amendment is to allow a variation to the Class D airspace effective times to coincide with the operating
hours of the Traverse City ATCT.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The coordinates for this airspace docket are based on North American Datum 83. Class D airspace designations are published
in Paragraph 5000 of FAA Order 7400.9A dated June 17, 1993, and effective September 16, 1993, which is incorporated
by reference in 14 CFR 71.1 (58 FR 36298; July 6, 1993). The Class D airspace designation listed in the document would
be published subsequently in the Order.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FAA has determined that this proposed regulation only involves an established body of technical regulations
for which frequent and routine amendments are necessary to keep them operationally current. It, therefore_(1) is
not a ``significant regulatory action'' under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under DOT
Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034; February 26, 1979); and (3) does not warrant preparation of a regulatory
evaluation as the anticipated impact is so minimal. Since this is a routine matter that will only affect air traffic
procedures and air navigation, it is certified that this rule, when promulgated, will not have a significant economic
impact on a substantial number of small entities under criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act.

The Proposal

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The FAA is considering an amendment to part 73 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR part 73) to establish Restricted
Area, R&hyph;6302E, Fort Hood, TX, above the existing Restricted Areas R&hyph;6302A, B, C, and D, to accommodate
the firing of heatseeker missiles at the Fort Hood AAF weapons complex. The maximum altitude of the existing Fort Hood
restricted area is 30,000 feet mean sea level (MSL). The proposed Restricted Area R&hyph;6302E would coincide with
the existing lateral boundaries of Restricted Areas R&hyph;6302A, B, C, and D, and would extend from 30,000 feet MSL
to 45,000 feet MSL. This action is a result of a Special Use Airspace Review conducted at the Fort Hood AAF in May 1993.
The proposed Restricted Area R&hyph;6302E would be a joint-use restricted area, activated by NOTAM 48 hours in advance,
not to exceed 90 days per year, weather makeup days included. The airspace would be returned to the controlling agency
when not required for military activities. The U.S. Army does not expect any increase in the total annual usage of the
area as a result of this proposal. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FAA has determined that this proposed regulation only involves an established body of technical regulations
for which frequent and routine amendments are necessary to keep them operationally current. It, therefore (1) is
not a ``significant regulatory action'' under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under DOT
Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034; February 26, 1979); and (3) does not warrant preparation of a regulatory
evaluation as the anticipated impact is so minimal. Since this is a routine matter that will only affect air traffic
procedures and air navigation, it is certified that this rule, when promulgated, will not have a significant economic
impact on a substantial number of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
The Commission has determined, as part of its oversight responsibilities, to review rules and guides periodically.
These reviews will seek information about the costs and benefits of the Commission's rules and guides and their regulatory
and economic impact. The information obtained will assist the Commission in identifying rules and guides that warrant
modification or recision.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
At this time, the Commission solicits written public comments concerning the Commission's Rules and Regulations
under the Wool Act.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Wool Act (15 U.S.C. 68) requires marketers of covered wool products to mark each product with (1) the generic names
and percentages by weight of the constituent fibers present in the wool product; (2) the name under which the manufacturer
or other responsible company does business, or in lieu thereof, the registered identification number (RN) of such
company; and (3) the name of the country where the wool product was processed or manufactured. Furthermore, the Wool
Act contains advertising and recordkeeping provisions. Pursuant to Section 6(a) of the Wool Act, ``[t]he Commission
is authorized and directed to make rules and regulations for the manner and form of disclosing information required
by this Act *&blank;*&blank;* and to make such further rules and regulations under and in pursuance of the terms of
this Act as may be necessary and proper for administration and enforcement.'' (15 U.S.C. 68d(a).) These implementing
rules and regulations are set forth at 16 CFR part 300. The Commission solicits public comments on the following questions:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. Is there a continuing need for the Rules and Regulations issued under the Wool Act?
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a. What benefits have the Rules provided to purchasers of the products or services affected by the Rules?
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
b. Have the Rules imposed costs on purchasers?
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. What changes, if any, should be made to the Rules to increase the benefits of the Rules to purchasers?
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a. How would these changes affect the costs the Rules impose on firms subject to their requirements?
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. What significant burdens or costs, including costs of compliance, have the Rules imposed on firms subject to their
requirements?
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a. Have the Rules provided benefits to such firms?
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. What changes, if any, should be made to the Rules to reduce the burdens or costs imposed on firms subject to their requirements?
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a. How would these changes affect the benefits provided by the Rules?
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
5. Do the Rules overlap or conflict with other federal, state, or local laws or regulations?
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
6. Since the Rules were issued, what effects, if any, have changes in relevant technology or economic conditions had
on the Rules?

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
The Commission has determined, as part of its oversight responsibilities, to review rules and guides periodically.
These reviews will seek information about the costs and benefits of the Commission's rules and guides and their regulatory
and economic impact. The information obtained will assist the Commission in identifying rules and guides that warrant
modification or recision. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
At this time, the Commission solicits written public comments concerning the Commission's Rules and Regulations
under the Fur Products Labeling Act. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Fur Act (15 U.S.C. 69) requires covered furs and fur products to be labeled, invoiced, and advertised to show (1)
the name(s) of the animal that produced the fur(s); (2) that the fur is used fur or that the fur product contains used
fur, when such is the fact; (3) that the fur product or fur is bleached, dyed, or otherwise artificially colored, when
such is the fact; and (4) the name of the country of origin of any imported furs used in the fur product. Furthermore,
the Fur Act contains invoicing, advertisting, and recordkeeping provisions. Pursuant to Section 8(b) of the Fur
Act, ``[t]he Commmision is authorized and directed to prescribe rules and regulations *&blank;*&blank;* as may
be necessary and proper for purposes of administration and enforcement of this Act.'' (15 U.S.C. 69f(b).) These implementing
rules and regulations are set forth at 16 CFR part 301. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Currently, Rules 19 and 27 (16 CFR 301.19 and 301.27) include provisions where measurements are expressed exclusively
in inches or fractions of inches. Under Executive Order 12770 of July 25, 1991 (56 FR 35801, July 29, 1991), and the Metric
Conversion Act, as amended by the Omnibus Trade and Competitiveness Act (15 U.S.C. 205b), all federal agencies are
required to use the SI metric system of measurement in all procurements, grants, and other business-related actvities
(which includes rulemakings), except to the extent that such use is impractical or is likely to cause significant
inefficiencies or loss of markets to United States firms. To comply with these requirements, should the Commission
elect to retain Rules 19 and 27 after conducting this review, the wording of these provisions will be altered to include
the metric equivalents in parentheses beside the measurements in inches. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Rule 19(i)(1) (16 CFR 301.19(i)(1)) would be revised to read: ``Any person dressing, processing, or treating a fur
pelt in such a manner that it is required under paragraph (e) or (h) of this section to be dsecribed as `color altered'
or `color added' shall place a black stripe at least one half inch (1.27 cm) in width across the leather side of the skin
immediately above the rump or place a stamp with a solid black center in the form of either a two inch (5.08 cm) square
or a circle at least two inches (5.08 cm) in diameter on the leather side of the pelt and shall use black ink for all other
stamps or markings on the leather side of the pelt.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Rule 19(i)(2) (16 CFR 301.19(i)(2)) would be revised to read: ``Any person dressing, processing or treating a fur
pelt which after processing is considered natural under paragraph (g) of this section shall place a white stripe at
least one-half inch (1.27 cm) in width across the leather side of the skin immediately above the rump or place a stamp
with a solid white center in the form of either a 2-inch (5.08 cm) square or a circle at least 2 inches (5.08 cm) in diameter
on the leather side of the pelt and shall use white ink for all other stamps or markings on the leather side of the pelt.''

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Rule 19(i)(3) (16 CFR 301.19(i)(3)) would be revised to read: ``Any person dressing, processing or treating a fur
pelt in such a manner that it is considered dyed under paragraph (d) of this section shall place a yellow stripe at least
one-half inch (1.27 cm) in width across the leather side immediately above the rump or place a stamp with a solid yellow
center in the form of either a 2-inch (5.08 cm) square or a circle at least 2 inches (5.08 cm) in diameter on the leather
side of the pelt and shall use yellow ink for all other stamps or markings on the leather side of the pelt.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Rule 19(1)(2) (16 CFR 301.19(1)(2)) would be revised to read: ``A recommended method for preparation of samples would
be: Carefully pluck hair samples from 10 to 15 different representative sites on the pelt or garment. This can best
be accomplished by using a long nose stainless steel pliers with a tip diameter of 1/16 inch (1.59 mm). The pliers should
be inserted at the same angle as the guard hairs with the tip opened to 1/4 inch (6.35 mm). After contact with the hide,
the tip should be raised about 1/4 inch (6.35 mm), closed tightly and pulled quickly and firmly to remove the hair.''

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The first sentence of Rule 27 (16 CFR 301.27) would be revised to read: ``At all times during the marketing of a fur product
the required label shall have a minimum dimension of one and three-fourths (13/4) inches by two and three-fourths
(23/4) inches (4.5 cm &times; 7 cm).'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
These are technical, non-substantive amendments to Rules 19 and 27 which merely provide metric equivalents to the
measurements expressed in inches; they do not create any new requirements. Thus, under the Administrative Procedure
Act (5 U.S.C. 553 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et seq.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
), no formal rulemaking proceeding is necessary to implement these revisions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If the Commission elects to retain Rule 43 (16 CFR 301.43), ``Use of deceptive trade or corporate names, trademarks
or graphic representations prohibited,'' after conducting this review, it intends to update certain terms to reflect
statutory and policy changes that have occurred since Rule 43 was originally promulgated. The phrase ``capacity
or tendency to mislead or deceive'' would be changed to conform with the language regarding deception that is set forth
in Cliffdale Associates, Inc., 103 F.T.C. 110, 164&hyph;65 (1984) and subsequent cases. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Accordingly, the Commission solicits public comments on the following questions: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. Is there a continuing need for the Rules and Regulations issued under the Fur Act?

At this time, the Commission solicits written public comments concerning the Commission's Rules and Regulations
under the Textile Act.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Textile Act (15 U.S.C. 70) requires marketers of covered textile products to mark each product with (1) the generic
names and percentages by weight of the constituent fibers present in the textile product; (2) the name under which
the manufacturer or other responsible company does business, or in lieu thereof, the registered identification
number (RN) of such company; and (3) the name of the country where the textile product was processed or manufactured.
Furthermore, the Textile Act contains advertising and recordkeeping provisions. Pursuant to section 7(c) of the
Textile Act, ``[t]he Commission is authorized and directed to make such rules and regulations, including the establishment
of generic names of manufactured fibers, under and in pursuance of the terms of this Act as may be necessary and proper
for administration and enforcement.'' (15 U.S.C. 70e(c).) These implementing rules and regulations are set forth
at 16 CFR part 303.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Currently, Rules 10, 21, 32, and 45 (16 CFR 303.10, 303.21, 303.32, and 303.45) include provisions where measurements
are expressed exclusively in inch/pound units. Under Executive Order 12770 of July 25, 1991 (56 FR 35801, July 29,
1991), and the Metric Conversion Act, as amended by the Omnibus Trade and Competitiveness Act (15 U.S.C. 205b), all
federal agencies are required to use the SI metric system of measurement in all procurements, grants, and other business-related
activities (which includes rulemakings), except to the extent that such use is impractical or is likely to cause significant
inefficiencies or loss of markets to United States firms. To comply with these requirements, should the Commission
elect to retain Rules 10, 21, 32, and 45 after conducting this review, the wording of these provisions will be altered
to include the metric equivalents in parentheses beside the measurements in inch/pound units.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Rule 10(b) (16 CFR 303.10(b)) would be revised to read: ``Where drapery or upholstery fabrics are manufactured on
hand-operated looms for a particular customer after the sale of such fabric has been consummated, and the amount of
the order does not exceed 100 yards (91.44 m) of fabric, the required fiber content disclosure may be made by listing
the fibers present in order of predominance by weight with any fiber or fibers required to be designated as ``other
fiber'' or ``other fibers'' appearing last, as for example:

Rule 21(a)(1) (16 CFR 303.21(a)(1)) would be revised to read: ``If the samples, swatches, or specimens are less than
two square inches (12.9 cm
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
2
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
) in area and the information otherwise required to appear on the label is clearly, conspicuously, and non-deceptively
disclosed on accompanying promotional matter in accordance with the Act and regulations;''
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Rule 32 (16 CFR 303.32) would be revised to read: ``Any upholstered product, mattress, or cushion which contains stuffing
which has been previously used as stuffing in any other upholstered product, mattress, or cushion shall have securely
attached thereto a substantial tag or label, at least 2 inches (5.08 cm) by 3 inches (7.62 cm) in size, and statements
thereon conspicuously stamped or printed in the English language and in plain type not less than 1/3 inch (8.38 mm)
high, indicating that the stuffing therein is composed in whole or in part of ``reused stuffing,'' ``secondhand stuffing,''
``previously used stuffing,'' or ``used stuffing.''
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Rule 45(a)(xv) (16 CFR 303.45(a)(xv)) would be revised to read: ``Flags with heading or more than 216 square inches
(13.9 dm
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
2
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
) in size;''
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
These are technical, non-substantive amendments to Rules 10, 21, 32, and 45 which merely provide metric equivalents
to the measurements expressed in inch/pound units; they do not create any new requirements. Thus, under the Administrative
Procedure Act (5 U.S.C. 553 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
), no formal rulemaking proceeding is necessary to implement these revisions.

SUMMARY: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
The Federal Trade Commission (the ``Commission'') is soliciting comments on the Used Motor Vehicle Trade Regulation
Rule (the ``Used Car Rule'' or ``Rule''). Specifically, the Commission is requesting comments about the overall
costs and benefits of the Rule and its overall regulatory and economic impact as a part of its systematic review of all
current Commission regulations and guides. Additionally, in accordance with the Regulatory Flexibility Act, the
Commission is soliciting comments and data on whether the Used Car rule has had a significant economic impact on small
entities, and if it has, whether the Rule should be amended to minimize any such economic impact on small entities.
The Commission also is soliciting comments on two nonsubstantive amendments the Commission proposes to make to the
Spanish language version of the Buyers Guide.

I. Background
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
The Commission promulgated the Used Car Rule, 16 CFR part 455, under the authority of the Federal Trade Commission
Act, 15 U.S.C. 41 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et seq. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(``FTC Act''), and the Magnuson Moss Warranty Act, 15 U.S.C. 2309, on November 19, 1984. 49 FR 45692 (1984). The Rule
became effective on May 9, 1985. Any violation of the Rule constitutes an unfair or deceptive act or practice under
the FTC Act, and is subject to civil penalties of up to $10,000 per violation.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Used Car Rule is primarily intended to prevent oral misrepresentations and unfair omissions of material facts
by used car dealers concerning warranty coverage. The Rule provides a uniform method for written disclosure of warranty
information on a window sticker called the ``Buyers Guide.'' The Rule requires clear disclosure on the Buyers Guide
of the basic terms and conditions of any warranty offered in connection with the sale of a used car, including the duration
of coverage, the percentage of total repair costs to be paid by the dealer, and the exact systems covered by the warranty.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Rule also requires other disclosures that must be printed directly on the Buyers Guide, including:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) A suggestion that consumers ask the dealer if a pre-purchase inspection is permitted; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) A warning against reliance on spoken promises that are not confirmed in writing; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) A list of fourteen major systems of an automobile and the major problems that may occur in these systems. The Rule
also provides that the Buyers Guide disclosures are to be incorporated by reference into the sales contract, and are
to govern in the event of an inconsistency between the Buyers Guide and the sales contract. When used car dealers conduct
sales in the Spanish language, Spanish language Buyers Guides are required.

II. Rule Reviews
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 601 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et seq. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(the ``RFA''), requires that the FTC conduct a periodic review of rules that have or may have a significant economic
impact on a substantial number of small entities. In addition, as part of its oversight responsibilities, the Commission
has determined to review rules and guides periodically. See 59 FR 2955 (Jan. 20, 1994). Both reviews will seek information
about the costs and benefits of the Commission's rules and guides and their regulatory impact. The information obtained
will assist the Commission in identifying rules and guides that warrant modification or rescission.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The purpose of the RFA review is limited to determining whether the Rule should be continued without change, or should
be amended or rescinded, consistent with the state objectives of applicable statutes, to minimize any significant
economic impact of the Rule upon a substantial number of small entities. For the purpose of the RFA review, a ``small
entity'' is a used motor vehicle dealer with less than $11.5 million in annual sales, as defined by the Small Business
Size Standards, 13 CFR 121.601. The purpose of the Commission's periodic review is to solicit comment on issues relating
to the operation of the Rule. This review is not limited to the Rule's impact on small entities, but encompass all affected
entities.

IV. Non-Substantive Amendments to the Rule
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Commission also solicits comment on two non-substantive amendments the Commission proposes to the Rule involving
the Spanish language version of the Buyers Guide, &sect;455.5 of the Rule. The first proposed change is grammatical:
The ``As Is'' (``Como Esta-Sin Garantia'') section of the Buyers Guide reads ``El vendedor no asume ninguna responsabilidad
por cualquier 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
las reparaciones
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 *&blank;*&blank;*'' (emphasis added). This language will be amended to read: ``El vendedor no asume ninguna responsabilidad
por cualquier reparacione *&blank;*&blank;*'' The second suggested modification appears in the ``Warranty''
(``Garantia'') section of the Buyers Guide. The word ``vendedo'' in the second full sentence will be amended to read
``Pida al 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->

Background
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
By letter dated November 17, 1993 (Administrative Record No. KY&hyph;1260), Kentucky submitted a proposed program
amendment that would add a new section (405 KAR 7:200) to Kentucky's Administrative Regulations. The proposed new
regulation offers surface coal mining permittees the option to dispose of coal combustion waste on the permit area
under the special waste permit-by-rule established at 401 KAR 45:060 Section 1(6).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
OSM announced receipt of the proposed amendment in the January 13, 1994, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(59 FR 1921) and, in the same document, opened the public comment period and provided an opportunity for a public hearing
on the adequacy of the proposed amendment. The public comment period closed on February 14, 1994.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
By letter dated April 18, 1994, Kentucky gave OSM notice that it was withdrawing the program amendment, submitted
on November 17, 1993, from further consideration. The regulation, which was the subject of the amendment, completed
the promulgation process and took effect on March 13, 1994. During promulgation, a letter of objection was attached
to the regulation by the Administrative Regulation Review Subcommittee, with the result that the regulation expired
April 15, 1994, upon adjournment of the regular session of the 1994 Kentucky General Assembly. During the same legislative
session, Senate bill 266 which addresses the same issues, was enacted into law and has been submitted to OSM as a proposed
amendment to the Kentucky regulatory program and will be the subject of a separate rulemaking by OSM.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Therefore, the proposed program amendment published in the

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
It has been certified that this proposed rule does not exert a significant economic impact on a substantial number
of small entities. This determination is made based upon the fact that the rule merely recodifies the procedural aspects
of the Defense Investigative Service Freedom of Information Act Program, which includes guidance on how and from
whom to request information pertaining to the Defense Investigative Service; it imposes no new requirements, rights,
or benefits on small entities; and will have neither a beneficial nor adverse affect on small entities. Prior publication
of this rule may be found at 53 FR 36968, September 23, 1988. Redesignated and amended at 56 FR 58180, November 16, 1991.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(a) The DIS organization includes a Headquarters located in Alexandria, Virginia; four Regions and one investigative
area with subordinate operating locations throughout the Continental United States (CONUS), Alaska, Hawaii, and
Puerto Rico; the Defense Industrial Security Clearance Office (DISCO), Columbus, Ohio; the Personnel Investigations
Center (PIC) and National Computer Center (NCC) in Baltimore, Maryland; Office of Industrial Security International
Europe (OISI&hyph;E), located in Brussels, Belgium with a subordinate office in Mannheim, Germany; Office of Industrial
Security International Far East (OISI&hyph;FE) located at Camp Drake, Japan; and the Department of Defense Security
Institute, located in Richmond, Virginia.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) A copy of the DIS Directory showing the addresses of all offices, is available to the public upon request and may
be obtained by following the procedures outlined in &sect;298.4. The names and duty addresses of DIS personnel serving
overseas are not released.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
It is the policy of DIS to make publicly available all information which may be released under the Freedom of Information
Act (FOIA), consistent with its other responsibilities. In implementing this policy, DIS follows the procedures
set forth in 32 CFR part 286. DIS maintains the following records which may be of interest to the public:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(a) The Defense Clearance and Investigations Index (DCII), which contains references to investigative records
created and held by DoD Components. The records indexed are primarily those prepared by the investigative agencies
of the DoD, covering criminal, fraud, counterintelligence, and personnel security information. This index also
includes security clearance determinations made by the various components of the Department of Defense. Information
in the DCII is not usually available to the general public, since general release would violate the privacy of individuals
whose names are indexed therein.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) Records created as required by DoD Directive 5105.42,

Procedures for release of DIS records.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(a) All requests will be submitted in writing to: Defense Investigative Service, Office of Information and Public
Affairs (V0020), 1340 Braddock Place, Alexandria, Virginia 22314&hyph;1651.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Requests directed to any agency activity (headquarters or field elements) will be forwarded to the Office of Information
and Public Affairs.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) All requests shall contain the following information:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) As complete an identification as possible of the desired material including to the extent known, the title, description,
and date. 32 CFR part 286 does not authorize ``fishing expeditions.'' In the event a request is not reasonably described
as defined in 32 CFR part 286, the requester will be notified by DIS of the defect.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) The request must contain the first name, middle name or initial, surname, date and place of birth, social security
number, and, if applicable, military service number of the individual concerned, with respect to material concerning
investigations of an individual.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) A statement as to whether the requester wishes to inspect the record or obtain a copy of it.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) A statement that all costs for search (in the case of ``other'' and ``commercial'' requesters), duplication (in
the case of all categories of requesters), and review (in the case of ``commercial requesters'') will be borne by the
requester even if no records, or no releasable records, are found, if appropriate. See 32 CFR part 286 for information
on fees and fee waivers.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5) The full address (including ZIP code) of the requester.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) A notarized request by an individual requesting investigative or other personnel records may be required to avoid
the risk of invasion of privacy. Requesters will be notified and furnished appropriate forms if this requirement
is deemed necessary. In lieu of a notarized statement, an unsworn declaration in accordance with 28 U.S.C. 1746 may
be required.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(d) When a request is incomplete or fails to include all of the information required, the requester will be contacted
for additional information prior to beginning release procedures.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(e) DIS shall normally respond to requests within 10 working days after receipt by the Office of Information and Public
Affairs, unless an extension is required and the requester is notified in writing. If a significant number of requests
prevents responding in 10 working days, requests will be processed on a first-come, first-served basis to ensure
equitable treatment to all requesters.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(f) When the release of information has been approved, a statement of costs computed in accordance with the DoD Fee
Schedule (32 CFR part 286), or a statement waiving the fee, will be included in the notification of approval. Records
approved for release will generally be mailed immediately following the receipt of fees. Fees may be waived or reduced
in accordance with 32 CFR part 286. Remittances must be in the form of a personal check, bank draft, or postal money order.
Remittances are to be made payable to the Treasurer of the United States. Certified documents may be requested for
an official government or legal function, and will be provided at a rate established by 32 CFR part 286 for each authentication.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(g) When requests are denied in whole or in part in accordance with 32 CFR part 286, the requester will be advised of the
identity of the official making the denial, the reason for the denial, the right of appeal of the decision, and the identity
of the person to whom an appeal may be addressed.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(h) Facilities for the review or reproduction of records following approval of the request or appeal are available
at the Defense Investigative Service, Office of Information and Public Affairs, 1340 Braddock Place, Alexandria,
Virginia 22314&hyph;1651. All other transactions will be conducted by mail.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) Appeal of Denial of DIS Records and Information:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) All appeals will be submitted in writing and reach the following appellate authority no later than 60 days after
the date of the initial denial letter: Director, Defense Investigative Service (V0000), 1340 Braddock Place, Alexandria,
Virginia 22314&hyph;1651.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) All appeals will contain at least the same identification of the records requested as the original request, and
a copy of the letter denying the request, if available. Requesters will be given appeal rights when a search has been
conducted and no records are located.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) All appeals will be reviewed by the Director, DIS, or the Special Assistant to the Director, DIS. Responses to appeals
normally shall be made within 20 working days after receipt, unless an extension is required and the appellant is notified.
When a request is approved on appeal, the procedures set forth in &sect;298.4(f) will be followed.

SUMMARY: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
The Coast Guard proposes amending the regulations concerning vessel Hull Identification Numbers (HIN) and establishing
new regulations requiring Certificates of Origin for new vessels offered for sale in the United States. The Coast
Guard is proposing the regulations in order to provide additional information identifying vessels and establishing
evidence of vessel ownership to aid in marine investigations, deter theft, and provide a more useful vessel identifier
for the purposes of developing the vessel identification system, as required by legislation. The Coast Guard also
proposes to make several editorial corrections to its HIN regulations.

Background and Purpose
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Secretary of Transportation is required to establish the Vessel Identification System (VIS) (46 U.S.C. chapters
125, 131 &amp; 313) for use by the public and law enforcement officials. The Secretary has delegated to the Commandant,
U.S. Coast Guard, the authority to implement VIS. VIS will provide a nationwide pool of vessel and vessel owner information
that will help in identification and recovery of stolen vessels and deter vessel theft. This rulemaking would aid
in the development of VIS by expanding the existing 12 character HIN to include certain vessel-specific information
and thereby create a more useful vessel identification number. Further, requiring vessel manufacturers and importers
to provide a Certificate of Origin with each vessel produced or imported for the purposes of sale would ensure the availability
of documentation certifying this information and establishing a chain of ownership.

Discussion of Proposed Amendments
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Investigations of lost and stolen vessels depend in large part on the proper authorities' ability to identify a vessel
and establish a chain of ownership. The proposed regulations would aid in this pursuit by expanding the current 12
character HIN to include detailed information about each vessel. In addition, a check digit in the expanded HIN would
make alteration of an HIN more difficult thereby helping to prevent fraud in the sale of vessels. The proposed regulations
would also require that vessel manufacturers provide a Certificate of Origin certifying the truth about certain
information in the HIN and for use as the first document in the paper trail establishing proof of vessel ownership.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Removal of the definition for ``model year'' would clear up a drafting error which has existed since the last time the
HIN regulations were amended in 1984. Finally, removal of the references to ``State Boating Law Administrator''
in 33 CFR 181.31(c) would allow States which use their Department of Motor Vehicles as vessel numbering and titling
authorities to issue HINs to individuals building their own vessels.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The following discusses the proposed changes to 33 CFR part 181:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
(a) ``Model Year'' Definition
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The definition of ``model year'' would be removed from &sect;181.3. Up until 1984 the regulations allowed for two
methods of indicating the date of manufacture in the last four characters of the 12 character HIN. When those two formats
were devised, it was the Coast Guard's understanding that the new model year would not commence prior to August. Some
manufacturers complained that they wanted to vary the introduction date of the new model year from year to year, but
that they were prevented from doing so by the HIN regulations which defines model year as the period beginning August
1 of any year and ending on July 31 of the following year. The Coast Guard amended the HIN regulations in 1984 to give vessel
manufacturers the freedom to designate model year in the HIN as they requested. The Coast Guard amended &sect;181.25(a)
to require characters 11 and 12 to indicate the model year using the last two characters of the model year such as ``84''
for 1984. However, due to a drafting error, the Coast Guard failed to delete the outdated and superfluous definition
of ``model year.'' The proposed amendments would remove the definition of ``model year'' from part 181.

(b) Incorporation by Reference
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The following material would be incorporated by reference in &sect;181.4:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
International Organization for Standardization (ISO) Standard 3166 ``Codes for the representation of names of
countries.'' International Organization for Standardization (ISO) Standard 1073/I&hyph;1976 ``Alphanumeric
character sets for optical recognition_Part I: Character Set OCR&hyph;A_Shapes and dimensions of the printed image.''
Copies of the material are available for inspection where indicated under 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
ADDRESSES.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Copies of the material are available at the addresses in &sect;181.4. Before publishing a final rule, the Coast Guard
will submit this material to the Director of the Federal Register for approval of the incorporations by reference.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ISO Standard 3166 contains two character alphabetic codes which would be used to indicate the ``country code'' in
the expanded HIN. ISO Standard 1073/I&hyph;1976 prescribes shapes and sizes of alphanumeric characters for optical
character recognition (OCR) systems, which means that the characters are both human and machine readable.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
(c) Nineteen Character Hull Identification Number
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The existing Hull Identification Number (HIN) is a unique 12 character serial number required on each recreational
vessel manufactured in or imported into the United States for the purposes of sale. The Coast Guard assigns the first
three characters, a Manufacturer Identification Code (MIC) which identifies the manufacturer or importer; characters
four through eight are a manufacturer serial number; characters nine and ten indicate date of certification for vessels
subject to safety standards or the date of manufacture for vessels not subject to standards; and characters eleven
and twelve indicate the model year.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
There are two serious problems involving the current 12 character HIN format. Thieves can alter an HIN and ``launder''
a stolen vessel in States with ineffective titling and registration programs. Similarly, the last four characters
in many HINs are fraudulently altered as a means of misrepresenting vessels as ``newer.''
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As early as May 1987, the National Auto Theft Bureau (NATB), which is supported by more than 600 casualty insurance
companies, recommended that the Coast Guard adopt a 17 character HIN format (similar to the format required for the
Vehicle Identification Number [VIN] on an automobile) as a means of detecting and deterring vessel theft. Each VIN
contains certain characters which describe features such as body style and engine type which are specific to the automobile
to which the VIN is assigned. A VIN also contains a check digit which assures the integrity of the other characters in
a VIN. According to the NATB and officials of the National Association of State Boating Law Administrators (NASBLA),
the additional HIN characters would lead to increased recovery of stolen vessels and more successful enforcement
efforts, thereby deterring would-be thieves.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
During meetings with the International Standards Organization (ISO) some ISO member countries expressed a desire
for the Coast Guard to include a two character country of MIC registration code as part of the expanded HIN format to
distinguish between MICs issued by different foreign countries. The Coast Guard agrees that including the two character
country of MIC registration code in the proposed HIN would be appropriate.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed expanded HIN would consists of 19 characters. The additional seven characters would indicate country
of MIC registration, length, hull material, principal means of propulsion, vessel type and a check digit. The expanded
HIN with its check digit would reflect additional information useful to law enforcement authorities investigating
vessel thefts and provide a useful means of identifying vessels in VIS.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 181.25 would be revised to require that each of the Hull Identification Numbers prescribed by &sect;181.23
must consist of 19 characters uninterrupted by slashes, hyphens or spaces:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Characters one and two would be the two character alphabetic ``country code'' from ISO Standard 3166. The country
code for Manufacturer ID Codes the Coast Guard assigns in the United States, for example, would be ``US.''
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Characters three through five would be the existing manufacturer identification code the Coast Guard assigns
to the vessel manufacturer in accordance with &sect;181.31(a).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Characters six through ten would be the serial number the manufacturer currently assigns in accordance with &sect;181.25(b).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) Characters eleven and twelve would indicate date of certification for vessels subject to safety standards or
the date of manufacture for vessels not subject to standards in accordance with the existing format specified in &sect;181.25(c).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5) Characters thirteen and fourteen would indicate the model year in accordance with the existing format specified
in &sect;181.25(d).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(6) The fifteenth character would indicate overall length of the vessel using a corresponding letter of the English
alphabet. The character, ``A,'' would indicate a vessel with a hull length of less than six feet; ``B'' would indicate
a vessel with a hull length of six feet to 10 feet, 11 inches; ``C'' would indicate 11 feet; ``D'' would indicate 12 feed,
and so on. The character, ``Z'', would indicate a vessel with a hull length of more than 31 feet. Inches would not be included
in the measurement of length, therefore, 15 feet, 10 inches is 15 feet and 16 feet, 2 inches is 16 feet.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(7) The sixteen character would indicate hull material using a corresponding Arabic numeral. Arabic numerals one
through eight would indicate aluminum, ferrocement, fiber reinforced plastic (FRP), flexible fabric, foam, plastic,
steel and wood, respectively.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(8) The seventeenth character would indicate the principal means of propulsion of the vessel using a corresponding
Arabic numeral. Arabic numerals one through nine would indicate air propeller, bracket mounted outboard, inboard,
inboard jet, inboard/outdrive, nonpowered, outboard, sail and sail with inboard auxiliary, respectively. Footnotes
to a table in this section would distinguish between which Arabic numerals to use to indicate nonpowered vessels,
sailboats and sailboats with auxiliary power.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(9) The eighteenth character would indicate the type of vessel using a corresponding Arabic numeral. Arabic numerals
one through nine would indicate air cushion vehicle; canoe, kayak, sailboard or surfboard; inflatable; monohull/cabin
configuration; monohull/closed bow; monohull/open bow; multihull/cabin or closed bow; multihull/open deck;
and personal watercraft, respectively. Footnotes to a table in this section would distinguish between which Arabic
numerals to use to indicate the vessel types described above.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(10) The nineteenth character would be a check digit determined by performing certain arithmetic calculations involving
the previous 18 characters. Characters consisting of letters of the English alphabet would be converted to corresponding
numerical values. A diagram in the section would show how the calculations should be performed. The Coast Guard has
developed a computer program which calculates the check digit and is available to any vessel manufacturer with a computer.
The Coast Guard has also developed several work sheets to help determine the HIN for a vessel which are also available.

(d) Reference to State Boating Law Administrator
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 181.31 prescribes the regulations on the assignment of a Manufacturer Identification Code (MIC) to each
recreational vessel manufacturer and importer. According to &sect;181.31(c), persons who are building vessels
for their own use and not for the purposes of sale, must obtain an entire Hull Identification Number from the State Boating
Law Administrator of the State where the vessel will be principally used, in lieu of applying for a MIC. A number of the
States use their Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV) for numbering and titling of vessels and the DMV would issue a State
HIN. Under the proposed amendments, references to ``State Boating Law Administrator'' would be removed from the
section and the words ``the issuing authority of the State'' would be added in their place.

(e) Certificate of Origin
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Secretary is required to include information assisting law enforcement officials in VIS (46 U.S.C. 12501(b)(6)).
A Certificate of Origin (COO) is a document issued by a product's manufacturer certifying to the truth of certain facts.
Many States require vessel owners to provide a COO before they will issue a title or register and number a vessel. Thus,
a COO is usually the first document in the paper trail identifying a vessel and establishing proof of ownership. Unfortunately,
many vessel manufacturers do not issue COOs for vessels they manufacture or they issue COOs which many States consider
unacceptable.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A purchaser's possession of a standardized COO for a vessel would ensure that documentation of the vessel's chain
of ownership is established. This would aid law enforcement investigations by providing a means to demonstrate vessel
ownership as well as providing a means to certify vessel information that could be used in the development of VIS.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under the proposed amendments the Coast Guard would add a new Subpart D_``Certificates of Origin for Boats.'' The
proposed amendments would require manufactures and U.S. importers of foreign-built vessels to provide a completed
COO with each vessel manufactured or imported. The issuing authorities in the States would be given the option of issuing
COOs to individuals building their own vessels or exempting them from the requirement altogether.

The Coast Guard is considering the development of a standardized COO form. For the reader's convenience, a prototype
of a proposed form is reproduced in appendix A. This form should be considered in conjunction with the proposed regulations.
Comments or suggestions pertaining to the format or content will be welcomed. Also, the Coast Guard specifically
seeks comments on the most cost efficient manner to create and distribute the forms. Any proposed form will be submitted
to the Office of Management and Budget for approval prior to publication of the final rule.

A COO furnished with a recreational vessel in accordance with &sect;181.43 would:

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(a) Be signed by or on behalf of the vessel manufacturer; and
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) Recite the following:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) The vessel's 19 character hull identification number assigned in accordance with &sect;181.25;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

Solicitation of Views
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Coast Guard is particularly interested in receiving comments on the following issues:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(a) The majority of the recreational vessel manufacturers are small volume builders who lack computers and cannot
use a computer program developed by the Coast Guard. These manufacturers may have a difficult time determining the
check digit in the proposed 19 character Hull Identification Number. When using simple arithmetic, those calculations
may take as long as 15 minutes per vessel. Is 15 minutes a reasonable estimate for performing the calculation?
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) Should the Coast Guard consider expecting certain classes of low cost vessels from the 19 character HIN, or do States
which number all watercraft insist on universal application of this requirement?
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) Are there other methods for calculation of the check digit which are not as time consuming and will still assure
the integrity of the other characters in an HIN?
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(d) The proposed regulations will require a COO for each new vessel manufactured or imported. Since a COO is unique
to the vessel to which it is assigned, there may be some additional requirements associated with ensuring that the
proper COO accompanies each vessel, particularly for importers of inflatables and similar, high volume, low cost
vessels which are shipped in bulk containers. As a result, the COO requirement in the proposed regulations may require
change in the manner in which small, high volume vessels are packaged for shipment. Should the Coast Guard consider
excepting from the COO requirement certain classes of low cost vessels, or vessels involving special problems associated
with the manner in which they are shipped?
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(e) Do the States which number all watercraft insist on universal application of the COO requirement?

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(f) A prototype of a proposed COO form is reproduced in appendix A. The Coast Guard proposes issuing a COO template to
all boat manufactures and importers which they could copy to make COO forms for each boat. The Coast Guard would partially
complete the COO templates with each manufacturer (or importer) name and address and the first five characters of
the HIN as a means for minimizing information collection burdens.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
However, the Coast Guard is seeking comments on whether the proposed COO contains sufficient security features and
information to make it an effective document. The NASBLA Numbering and Titling Committee has recommended, through
a mailing to the Coast Guard, that the COO form be machine readable utilizing the OCR&hyph;A font which provides the
criteria for character set and print quality for optical character recognition; be uniform in all jurisdictions;
and conform to the following format, standards, security, and specifications:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Have an engraved border produced from banknote engraved artwork;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Feature a prismatic, i.e., rainbow printing which is used as a deterrent to color copying, and/or a copy void pantograph,
i.e., the word ``void'' appears when the document is copied;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Be printed using erasable fluorescent background inks which fluoresce under ultraviolet light and react to any
attempt to erase information;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) Include a background security design consisting of a repetitious pattern which hinders counterfeiting efforts;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5) Be printed on sensitized security paper that is reactive to chemicals commonly used to alter documents;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(6) Be printed on non optical brightener paper without added optical brighteners which will not fluoresce under ultraviolet
light;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(7) Include a microline_a line of small alpha characters in capital letters which requires a magnifying glass to read;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(8) Bear a pre-printed consecutive number for control purposes;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(9) Consist of complex colors which are developed by using a mixture of two or more of the primary colors (red, yellow
and blue) and black if required; and
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(10) Contain a security thread with or without a watermark, and/or an intaglio print with or without a latent image,
and/or a security laminate.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Coast Guard's preliminary investigations indicate that due to the high cost of creating forms meeting the NASBLA
suggested requirements, the Coast Guard could not absorb the cost of printing COO forms meeting the NASBLA security
features. The Coast Guard does not have the authority to charge manufacturers to reimburse the Coast Guard for its
expenditures on COO forms. Therefore, if the Coast Guard were to adopt the NASBLA recommended security features,
manufacturers would be responsible for creating or purchasing the forms on their own.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Are there interested parties who believe the NASBLA recommended security features would be appropriate for a State
issued certificate of title, but are excessive for a manufacturer issued certificate of origin?
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Some manufacturers build thousands of vessels annually, while others may build as few as a single vessel annually.
What do printers estimate would be the costs to various volume boat manufacturers for creating and printing forms
meeting the NASBLA recommended security features?
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If the Coast Guard were able to obtain authorized funding, what would be the cost to the Coast Guard for creating, printing,
partially completing, and distributing forms meeting the NASBLA recommended security features to various volume
boat manufacturers?
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Once the contents and security features of a finalized COO form are developed, based upon comments received, what
are the most equitable and cost-efficient methods for creating, printing, and distributing COO forms to boat manufacturers?
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(g) The proposed &sect;181.47 addresses the subject of duplicate COO forms.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Who should be able to apply for a duplicate COO form from a boat manufacturer?
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) What information should a duplicate COO contain?
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Should an affidavit or other type of proof be required as a condition to obtaining a duplicate COO form?
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) If a duplicate COO must contain the same information as an original, should the regulations require the manufacturer
to retain a copy of each original COO form? For how long?

Regulatory Assessment
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This proposal is not a significant regulatory action under Executive Order 12866, and has not been reviewed by the
Office of Management and Budget. It is also not significant under the ``Department of Transportation Regulatory
Policies and Procedures'' (44 FR 11040; February 26, 1979). The Coast Guard expects the economic impact of this proposal
to be so minimal that a Regulatory Assessment is unnecessary.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This project would benefit law enforcement officers by aiding in deterrence and detection of vessel fraud and theft.
An estimated 2,000,000 recreational vessels are manufactured or imported annual. Issuing authorities in the States
issue an estimated 17,000 HINs to individuals building their own vessels annually. This means an estimated 2,017,000
HINs are affixed annually. The estimated average cost for the affixing the existing 12 character HIN is $.50 per vessel.
The estimated cost of expansion to a 19 character format is an additional $.25 per vessel, for a total cost of approximately
$.75 per vessel.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Coast Guard is soliciting specific comments on the estimated costs for COOs.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(a) Take no action. If the Coast Guard fails to take any action, the numbers of vessels stolen and the incidence of vessel
fraud involving altered HINs will continue to increase. In addition, the development of VIS requires a means for identification
of each vessel and proof of vessel ownership. Use of the 19 character HIN and a COO requirement appear to be the best way
to accomplish those requirements. Many of the States and many law enforcement agencies support the proposal for a
19 character HIN and NASBLA, the National Boating Safety Advisory Council (NBSAC) and the National Association of
Marine Investigators (NAMI), all support Coast Guard adoption of the 19 character HIN. The Coast Guard has also received
numerous complaints from owners who are unable to register their vessels because they do not have a COO.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) Initiate a rulemaking to:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Amend the HIN regulations in 33 CFR part 181 to require additional information about the vessel to be reflected
in the HIN and add a requirement for a check digit to aid in the prevention of fraud, thereby expanding the current HIN
format from 12 to 19 characters; and
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Require manufacturers and importers to complete a Builder's Certification.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Expanding the HIN to 19 characters would provide the best means of developing a vessel identifier for VIS and help to
discourage and detect alterations of HINs through inclusion of the check digit. While requiring all vessel manufacturers
to provide a completed Builder's Certification would have the advantage of utilizing one form for all vessels whether
documented, numbered or titled, it would prove overly burdensome to many manufacturers and importers.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Builder's Certification is designed for use by those documenting a vessel under 46 CFR part 67. Obtaining endorsements
for documented vessels requires detailed information about the vessel, including the country in which the vessel
and its major components were manufactured. Since a COO does not satisfy these documentation information requirements,
it is not accepted as evidence of ownership for the purposes of documentation. The Builder's Certification satisfies
documentation requirements, but would require information well beyond what is needed for VIS purposes and it would
be overly burdensome to require manufacturers and importers to complete a Builder's Certification for every recreational
vessel. The estimated reporting burden for the Builder's Certification is 30 minutes, while the estimated burden
to complete the COO is five minutes. Therefore, requiring a Builder's Certification is not the preferred alternative
for establishing the chain of ownership for the purposes of VIS.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) Initiate a rulemaking to:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Amend the HIN regulations in 33 CFR part 181 to require additional information about the vessel to be reflected
in the HIN and add a requirement for a check digit to aid in the prevention of fraud, thereby expanding the current HIN
format from 12 to 19 characters; and
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Require manufacturers and importers to provide a completed COO for each recreational vessel they manufacture
or import. This is the preferred alternative.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This alternative would provide VIS with the preferred 19 character HIN as well as the best method of establishing the
chain of ownership for VIS purposes through the COO requirement. The COO requirement would provide all the information
necessary for VIS and would take just five minutes to complete.

Small Entities
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Under the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et seq.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
), the Coast Guard must consider whether this proposal will have a significant economic impact on a substantial number
of small entities. ``Small entities'' include independently owned and operated small business that are not dominant
in their field and that otherwise qualify as ``small business concerns'' under section 3 of the Small Business Act
(15 U.S.C. 632).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed regulations will apply to the following small entities: Small manufacturers building vessels, small
importers importing vessels and State issuing authorities.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
There are reporting requirements associated with an expanded HIN that could be more burdensome to small entities
than to the larger volume manufacturers, especially in the calculation of the check digit. Eighty percent of the new
recreational vessels manufactured annually are build by 20 percent of the industry. These are large companies with
engineering departments that are equipped with computers and the expertise to understand and properly encode the
additional characters and the check digit. The majority of the recreational vessel manufacturers, however, are
small volume builders who may have a more difficult time implementing the regulations and making the necessary calculations
to determine the check digit. When using simple arithmetic, those calculations may take as long as 15 minutes per vessel.
The Coast Guard has developed a computer program which calculates the check digit which is available to any vessel
manufacturer with a computer. The Coast Guard has also developed several work sheets to help determine the HIN for
a vessel and the worksheets are also available. Therefore, preliminary analysis indicates that a 19 character HIN
will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The requirement for a COO may also result in additional requirements for small entities. Since a COO is unique to the
vessel to which it is assigned, there may be some additional requirements associated with assuring that the proper
COO accompanies each vessel, particularly for importers of inflatables and similar, high volume, low cost vessels
which are shipped in bulk containers. As a result, the COO requirement in the proposed regulations may require changes
in the manner in which small, high volume vessels are packaged for shipment. However, a preliminary analysis indicates
that the COO requirement will not result in a significant impact on a substantial number of small entities.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Therefore, the Coast Guard certifies under 5 U.S.C. 605(b) that this proposal, if adopted, will not have a significant
economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. If, however, you think that your business or organization
qualifies as a small entity and that this proposal will have a significant economic impact on your business or organization,

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
There are approximately 4,000 U.S. manufacturers and importers of recreational vessels. They manufacture or import
an estimated 2,000,000 recreational vessels annually.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Eighty percent are built by major manufacturers. For those manufacturers the Coast Guard estimates five minutes
per vessel to determine the HIN and affix it to the vessel:

Twenty percent of the vessels are built by small and often non-sophisticated manufacturers. For those manufacturers
the Coast Guard estimates 15 minutes per vessel to determine the HIN and affix it to the vessel:

An estimated 17,000 individuals build their own vessels annually. Individuals building their own vessels are assigned
an entire Hull Identification Number by the State in which they reside. The Coast Guard estimates that it takes an individual
approximately 15 minutes to affix the HIN to a vessel:

<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

This total annual burden estimate would vary from year to year depending upon the state of the national economy which
impacts upon annual production figures.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
There is also no practical way to estimate the burden per respondent for the proposed COO requirement. The respondents
are vessel manufacturers and importers and State vessel registration and numbering authorities and members of the
public who build their own vessels. Most manufacturers with a computer will not suffer from significant burdens,
because the computer can be programmed to generate completed COOs. For those manufacturers the Coast Guard estimates
3 minutes per vessel to complete a COO:

Twenty percent of the vessels are built by small and often non-sophisticated manufacturers. For those manufacturers
the Coast Guard estimates 5 minutes per vessel to type the required information (security standards would require
that the COO be machine prepared):

Approximately 17,000 individuals build their own vessels annually. The States assign Hull Identification Numbers
to individuals building their own vessels. For individuals the Coast Guard estimates 30 minutes per vessel to obtain
a COO from the State.

States and territories participating in VIS and assigning Hull Identification Numbers would have computers to generate
the COO and HIN on the basis of information supplied by an individual. The Coast Guard estimates 5 minutes for States
or territories to enter information about a vessel into a computer and generate a COO:

Federalism
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Coast Guard has analyzed this proposal in accordance with the principles and criteria contained in Executive
Order 12612 and has determined that this proposal does not have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the
preparation of a Federalism Assessment. These regulations will benefit State boating authorities enforcing State
titling and registration regulations.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Title 46 U.S.C. 4302 authorizes the Coast Guard to establish HIN regulations. Unless the Secretary provides an exemption,
a State may not establish, continue in effect, or enforce a law or regulation that is not identical to a regulation prescribed
under 46 U.S.C. 4302. Therefore, the Coast Guard intends to preempt State and local laws and regulations which are
not identical to the Coast Guard's HIN or COO requirements. Title 46 U.S.C. chapter 125 requires the Coast Guard to
establish VIS requirements. The States' participation in VIS is entirely voluntary; however, once a State elects
to participate, it must comply with the requirements of VIS in order to ensure the integrity and uniformity of the system.
Therefore, only those States meeting all of the VIS requirements will be allowed to participate in the VIS system,
and the Coast Guard would preempt State and local laws prescribing requirements for VIS which are not identical to
those the Coast Guard prescribes.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) anticipates a significant increase in the number of
alternatively fueled motor vehicles in the United States. This expectation stems from initiatives by the President,
Congress, State and local governments, and private interest, since these vehicles will help reduce air pollution
and conserve petroleum fuel. NHTSA has undertaken a comprehensive program to address the safe performance of these
vehicles on the road and in crashes. Further, because the Clean Air Act specifies that vehicle fleets in non-attainment
areas (mostly large cities) must be converted to clean burning fuels, many city transit bus fleets are being converted
to run on fuels such as compressed natural gas (CNG). As NHTSA has become more aware of these fleets of heavy vehicles
powered by CNG, the agency believes that their safe performance merits examination.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
On January 21, 1993, NHTSA published a notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM) which proposed requirements for CNG fuel
system and fuel container integrity (58 FR 5323). The vehicle fuel system requirements were proposed to apply to vehicles
with a GVWR of 4536 kilograms or less, and all school buses. The container requirements were proposed to apply to CNG
fuel containers for any vehicle.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On April 25, 1994, the agency published a final rule (59 FR 19648), which addresses the fuel system integrity of CNG
vehicles. The new regulation, Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standard (FMVSS) No. 303, applies to all passenger cars,
trucks, buses, and multipurpose passenger vehicles with a GVWR of 4536 kilograms of less, and all school buses regardless
of weight. FMVSS No. 303 sets allowable leakage limits for the vehicle fuel system after a barrier crash test. With
regard to the fuel container requirements, NHTSA anticipates issuing another final rule that will specify performance
requirements addressing the strength, durability, and pressure relief of CNG fuel containers. In addition, as a
result of public comments on the January 1993 NPRM, the agency anticipates issuing a supplemental notice of proposed
rulemaking for CNG fuel containers addressing internal corrosion, brittle fracture under low temperatures, environmental
degradation, external damage, and fragmentation.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The January 1993 NPRM briefly discussed the issue of whether vehicles with a GVWR of over 4536 kilograms, other than
school buses, should be included in the vehicle requirements. The agency believes that an opportunity should be provided
for a more focused view on this issue. This request for comment will serve that purpose.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A total of 58 comments were received on the NPRM, of which six addressed CNG safety for vehicles over 4536 kilograms
GVWR other than school buses. Four of the six commenters, Navistar, Chrysler, Flexible, and Amoco, believed that
federal safety requirements should not apply to CNG-powered heavy vehicles. The main reason given by the commenters
was that the vehicle applicability of the CNG fuel system integrity standard should be the same as that for NHTSA's
liquid fuel system integrity standard, FMVSS No. 301, ``Fuel System Integrity.'' The latter only applies to vehicles
with a GVWR of 4536 kilograms or less, and school buses. However, two commenters believed that the requirements should
apply to heavier vehicles. The Transportation Manufacturing Company, a bus manufacturer, believed that heavy vehicles
should have requirements that are comparable to those for smaller vehicles. No rationale was provided. The Washington
Superintendent for Public Instruction (WSPI), also believed that these vehicles should be regulated. WSPI stated
that the agency should consider including these vehicles in the proposed rule, but did not offer a rationale.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Because of the lack of accident data indicating a fuel system integrity problem for CNG-powered heavy vehicles, and
the lack of rationale from the two supporters, the agency concluded that FMVSS No. 303 should not apply to heavy vehicles.
However, because of the increasing number of CNG-powered transit buses, the agency seeks information by which to
consider whether federal safety action is desirable, for both transit buses and or other heavy vehicles. It may be
that action is merited with regard to buses, which carry many occupants and can have high traffic exposure, but not
other heavy vehicles with only one or two occupants.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As part of NHTSA's inquiry in this notice, the agency seeks comments on the desirability of actions which would be harmonized
with those of Canada.

United States Requirements
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
FMVSS No. 303 requires that school buses, regardless of weight, must comply with a moving contoured barrier crash
test. In this test, a barrier traveling longitudinally at 48 kilometers per hour impacts the bus at any point and angle.
During and after the impact, the fuel pressure drop must not exceed a specified limit. The final rule contains no requirements
for heavy vehicles other than school buses with a GVWR of over 4536 kilograms.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

Canada's Existing and Proposed Requirements
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Currently, Canadian motor vehicle safety standard No. 301.2, ``CNG Fuel System Integrity,'' requires that all vehicles
with a GVWR of more than 4536 kilograms be subjected to a 48 kilometers per hour contoured barrier crash test. This is
similar to the test NHTSA requires for school buses in FMVSS No. 303. On December 11, 1993, Canada proposed an amendment
to its standard. Under the amendment, the current requirement would apply to vehicles with containers mounted lower
than 183 centimeters from the ground. If the fuel containers are mounted 183 centimeters or more above the ground,
the vehicle would need to meet the requirements of the National Standard of Canada CAN/CGA&hyph;B149.4&hyph;M91
Natural Gas for Vehicles Installation Code, dated January 1991 (copy available in the docket). This is a design standard
which specifies in great detail the method for building a CNG vehicle.

Request for Comments
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
NHTSA seeks two types of information in this notice. First, the agency seeks information regarding the current and
projected population size and vehicle type (transit bus, intercity bus, heavy truck, or other heavy vehicle) for
CNG vehicles with a GVWR of over 4536 kilograms. Second, NHTSA seeks information about the potential safety problems
of these vehicles. When appropriate, please comment by vehicle type, i.e., transit bus, intercity bus, heavy truck,
or other type of heavy vehicle.

CNG Heavy Vehicle Population: Current and Projected
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
1. The agency requests information on how many CNG transit buses, intercity buses, heavy trucks, and other heavy vehicles
of over 4536 kilograms GVWR are in service or are planned to be placed in service in the United States. How many of these
vehicles are made by an original equipment manufacturer (OEM) and how many are aftermarket vehicles that are converted
from a vehicle powered by gasoline, diesel, or other fuel?
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. How many entities manufacture heavy CNG vehicles by type, i.e., transit bus, intercity bus, heavy truck, or other
type of heavy vehicle? How many convert them from other fuels, by type, if appropriate? What specifications are used
for converting these vehicles? Do voluntary industry guidelines exist? Please describe and provide the guidelines
or citations.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. How long have heavy CNG vehicles (by type) been used in this country? What are the projections for their future use,
in terms of numbers and in type of usage?
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. What are the various locations for mounting CNG containers on heavy vehicles? Which are more common; less common?
Why? At what height are the CNG containers mounted? Are they typically protected by shielding or cages? What factors
go into deciding where to mount the container on the vehicle? How many CNG containers are typically placed on a heavy
vehicle, and how much do the containers weigh? Does the number of containers vary, depending upon the type of vehicle,
i.e., transit bus, intercity bus, heavy truck, or other type of heavy vehicle?

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
Performance in Crashes
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The agency is interested in obtaining specific information about crashes involving these heavy vehicles. General
information about the number of accidents as well as information regarding specific issues such as container detachment
would be helpful.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
5. Have there been any CNG fuel container or fuel system failures in these types of vehicles? If so, describe the failure,
e.g., sequence of events, what failed, and how it failed. If the failure occurred as the result of a crash, was another
vehicle involved? Please describe the other vehicle.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
6. Was the vehicle a transit bus, intercity bus, heavy truck, or some other type of heavy vehicle? Was it an OEM vehicle
or a conversion? Who was the manufacturer of the vehicle? If it was a conversion, who did the conversion? Was the conversion
done before or after the vehicle's first consumer purchase?
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
7. Please identify and describe any situations where a container became detached in a crash situation? Did the container
leak? If crashes occurred, were they reported to a policy agency, hazardous materials agency, or other State/local
agency?
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
8. Should the agency specify how the fuel containers should be attached to the vehicles? Should a requirements apply
to all vehicles or just for those with containers mounted greater than 183 centimeters above the ground (such as referenced
in the Canadian proposal)? Are CNG tanks rigidly mounted or are they mounted so as to be isolated from shock in a crash,
permitting some allowable design movement? What is the typical orientation of the CNG tank with respect to the longitudinal
axis of the vehicle? Does a CNG tank's mounting orientation and method affect its useful life?

9. Were there any injuries to the vehicle occupants, pedestrians, emergency personnel, or other individuals? What
was the type and seriousness of the injury?
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
10. What type (steel, aluminum, fiberglass wrap, carbon fiber wrap, hoop wrap, full wrap, all composite, or other)
was the fuel container? What were the dimensions of the container? What was the service pressure of the container?
Who manufactured the container? How long had it been in service? To which design specification or standard were the
tanks built?
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
11. Should any Federal standard include a labeling requirement to address the periodic reinspection of fuel systems
on alternatively fueled vehicles? Should States establish guidelines to address the periodic reinspection or recertification
of such fuel systems? Should these schedules be set at specified time or mileage intervals? After a vehicle is involved
in an accident?
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
12. Should CNG heavy vehicles, which are not school buses, be crash tested for fuel system integrity in the same way
as heavy school buses under FMVSS No. 303, i.e., a contoured barrier traveling at 48 kilometers per hour striking the
test vehicle at any point and angle? If so, which types of CNG heavy vehicle should be included, i.e., transit bus, intercity
bus, heavy truck, or other type? Are there other tests or guidelines which would be more appropriate to assure the fuel
system integrity of such vehicles? If so, what are they?

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
Venting
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Because of the size of these vehicles, there may be large enclosed areas in which natural gas could accumulate if there
is a slow leak in the CNG fuel system.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
13. Are there instances where gas accumulated? Did any of them result in explosions?
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
14. Should venting of the container away from possible areas of accumulation and potential ignition sources be required
to address leakage accumulation?
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
15. What experimental or observed data are available regarding the dispersion behavior that results from a CNG fuel
system leak? Will the gas rise or remain near the ground? If the gas remains near the ground, how long will it remain there?
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
Leakage Detection and Warning
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
If there is a leak in the fuel system, there would be little or no visible evidence of the gas accumulation. If persons
nearby could not smell the gas, it could accumulate in an area near them without notice, which would increase the potential

Background 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The domestic groundfish fisheries of the BSAI and GOA in the exclusive economic zone (EEZ) are managed under the Fishery
Management Plan (FMP) for the Groundfish Fishery of the Bering Sea and Aleutian Islands Area and the FMP for Groundfish
of the GOA. The FMPs were prepared by the North Pacific Fishery Management Council (Council) under the Magnuson Fishery
Conservation and Management Act (16 U.S.C. 1801 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et seq.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
) (Magnuson Act) and are implemented for the U.S. fishery by regulations at 50 CFR parts 620, 672, and 675. The domestic
fishery for Pacific halibut off Alaska is managed by the International Pacific Halibut Commission (IPHC), as provided
by the Northern Pacific Halibut Act of 1982 (16 U.S.C. 773&hyph;773k), with implementing regulations at 50 CFR part
301. Regulations implementing individual fishing quotas (IFQs) for the domestic groundfish and halibut fisheries
off Alaska are at 50 CFR part 676. The king and Tanner crab fisheries of the Bering Sea and Aleutian Islands area are managed
under the FMP for the Commercial King and Tanner Crab Fisheries in the Bering Sea and Aleutian Islands. This FMP delegates
management of the crab resources in the Bering Sea and Aleutian Islands area to the State of Alaska (State) with Federal
oversight. Regulations necessary to carry out the crab FMP appear at 50 CFR part 671.

Section 313 of the Magnuson Act, as amended by section 404 of the High Seas Driftnet Fisheries Enforcement Act, Pub.
L. 102&hyph;582, authorizes the Council to prepare, in consultation with the Secretary of Commerce (Secretary),
a Research Plan for all fisheries under the Council's jurisdiction except salmon fisheries. The proposed Research
Plan would require that observers be stationed on certain fishing vessels and U.S. fish processors participating
in the BSAI groundfish, GOA groundfish, and Bering Sea and Aleutian Islands area king and Tanner crab fisheries, and
it would allow these requirements to be extended to the halibut fishery off Alaska. Observers would be deployed for
the purpose of collecting data necessary for the conservation, management, and scientific understanding of fisheries
under the Council's authority. The Research Plan also would establish a system of fees to pay for the costs of implementing
the Research Plan. The fees would be based on the exvessel value of retained catch in the BSAI and GOA groundfish fisheries,
the Bering Sea and Aleutian Islands area king and Tanner crab fisheries, and the Pacific halibut fishery off Alaska
(Research Plan fisheries). Future recommendations by the Council to include other fisheries under the Research
Plan would require an amendment or amendments to the Research Plan and to the regulations implementing it. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Regulations implementing Amendments 18 and 13 to the FMPs for Groundfish of the GOA and the Groundfish Fishery of the
Bering Sea and Aleutian Islands Area, respectively (54 FR 50386, December 6, 1989), authorized a data collection
program to obtain information necessary for conservation and management of the groundfish fisheries. One of the
measures in Amendments 18 and 13 authorized a comprehensive domestic fishery observer program. The Secretary, in
consultation with the Council, prepared and implemented an Observer Plan to implement provisions of that program
(55 FR 4839, February 12, 1990). The Alaska Board of Fisheries (Board) implemented a Shellfish Onboard Observer Program
for the king and Tanner crab fisheries off Alaska in April 1988 (5 AAC 39.645). Currently, no observer program is established
for the Pacific halibut fishery in convention waters off Alaska. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Two problems with the current Federal and State observer programs have been identified. First, the costs of observer
coverage are not borne by all fishery participants. Under the current Federal observer program, some groundfish
operations are required to pay for 100 percent observer coverage, others are required to pay for 30 percent coverage,
and still other operations that benefit from the observer program pay none of the cost. The last group includes some
groundfish and all halibut operations, because they have no observer coverage requirements. State king and Tanner
crab regulations require observer coverage for all vessels that process king or Tanner crab in waters off Alaska,
but mandate no observer coverage for crab catcher vessels or shoreside processors. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Second, the current method of paying for observers under the Federal and State observer programs limits NMFS and State
control over the observer programs and impedes the agencies' ability to manage the programs effectively. Observer
contractors are not solely responsible to NMFS or to the State for the quality of their work performance; sometimes
they have conflicting responsibilities to their clients, to whom they are providing observers, and to NMFS or to the
State. The owners and operators of vessels and processing facilities now are responsible for making arrangements
with an observer contractor of their choice to meet observer requirements and for paying the costs of observers directly
to that contractor. This direct business relationship, and the ability of an owner or operator to select among the
group of contractors, mean that the contractors and, indirectly, the observers, work for the operations they are
observing. This relationship could provide a means for an operation to reward or penalize contractors and their observers
and thus negatively influence the work performance of the observers and quality of the data collected. This appearance
of a conflict of interest could reduce the credibility of observer data. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
To resolve these problems, the Council initiated development of the Research Plan. A draft EA/RIR for the Research
Plan was initially reviewed and approved for public distribution and comment by the Council and its advisory bodies
at their January 15&hyph;17, 1991, meetings. After reviewing written comments and advice from its advisory bodies,
and hearing public testimony at its meetings of April 23&hyph;26, 1991, the Council further refined the Research
Plan. A revised EA/RIR was reviewed and approved for public distribution and comment by the Council and its advisory
bodies at their April 20&hyph;26, 1992, meetings. After reviewing written comments, obtaining further advice from
its advisory bodies, and hearing public testimony at its June 23&hyph;28, 1992, meeting, the Council adopted the
Research Plan and recommended that it be submitted to the Secretary for review. The EA/RIR was updated in December
1993 to reflect newly available information. The Council approved the Research Plan as described in this proposed
rule at its December 1993 meeting.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
1. Provide a framework for an observer program for the Alaska groundfish fisheries and the Pacific halibut fishery
to accommodate inseason management and stock assessment needs, and to provide accurate, real-time data of sufficient
quality to implement an individual vessel incentive program developed to meet specified management objectives
of the Council; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. Provide a framework for an observer program for Bering Sea and Aleutian Islands area king and Tanner crab fisheries
to accommodate inseason management needs, monitor industry compliance with Federal and State regulations, and
collect biological and management data necessary to achieve the sustained yield of the crab resource without overfishing;

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
3. Ensure that the groundfish and crab observer programs are efficient and cost effective, that any increased costs
are commensurate with the quality and usefulness of the data to be derived from any revisions to the programs, and that
such changes are necessary to meet fishery management needs; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. Provide for cooperation and coordination between the groundfish observer program administered by NMFS and the
crab observer program administered by the Alaska Department of Fish and Game (ADF&amp;G). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
Determination of Research Plan Fees 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
NMFS would annually establish a Research Plan fee percentage for the upcoming calendar year. As described in this
preamble, the fee percentage would be based on standard exvessel prices by species and projections of the following:
(1) Retained catches by species (i.e., catch retained by either at-sea or shoreside processors) in all Research Plan
fisheries; (2) observer program costs; and (3) the surplus in the North Pacific Fishery Observer Fund (Fund), other
sources of funding for the Research Plan, and nonpayments. After consulting with the Council and State, NMFS would
publish the fee percentage and the values of the variables on which it is based in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 and invite comments. After considering comments received and again consulting with the Council and the State, NMFS
would publish final values in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Standard Exvessel Prices.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 NMFS would annually establish standard exvessel prices for species harvested in Research Plan fisheries. These
prices would be used in estimating the total exvessel value of the Research Plan fisheries for the coming year and in
assessing fees. The standard exvessel prices would be based on: (1) Exvessel price information for the most recent
12-month period for which data are available, (2) factors that are expected to change exvessel prices in the upcoming
calendar year, and (3) any other relevant information that may affect expected exvessel prices during the upcoming
calendar year. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Retained Catch.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 NMFS would project retained catch, by species, for the Research Plan fisheries annually, using the best available
information concerning expected catches and discards. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Total Exvessel Value.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 NMFS would annually calculate the total exvessel value of retained catches for Research Plan fisheries as the sum
of the products of the standard exvessel prices and projected retained catches, for all Research Plan species. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Observer Program Costs.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 NMFS and ADF&amp;G would each prepare an annual budget that identifies expected recoverable Research Plan costs
for the upcoming calendar year. Recoverable costs identified in each budget would include: (1) Costs for observer
training, certification, briefing, and debriefing; (2) costs for stationing observers, including travel, salaries,
benefits, and insurance; (3) costs for data collection, transmission, input, processing, and management; and (4)
contract services and general program operational costs, excluding overhead. The estimated budget would be based
on anticipated observer coverage and the anticipated costs directly incurred in carrying out the Research Plan.
The observer program costs also would include the costs associated with a risk-sharing pool to provide comprehensive
insurance coverage for vessels and owners if such an insurance program is established under section 313 of the Magnuson
Act (see Risk-sharing Pool, in this preamble.) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Surplus Funds, Other Sources of Funding, and Fee Nonpayment.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Annually, NMFS would project each of the following: (1) The surplus that would be in the Fund at the end of the current
calendar year, (2) the funds that would be available from other sources for use in funding the Research Plan during
the upcoming calendar year, and (3) the nonpayment rate on fees assessed under the Research Plan during the upcoming
calendar year. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Calculation of the Fee Percentage.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Under the Magnuson Act, the fee percentage established to pay for the costs of implementing the Research Plan may not
exceed 2 percent of the exvessel value of fish harvested under the authority of the Council (except salmon), including
shellfish and the Northern Pacific halibut fishery. Annually, the fee percentage for the upcoming calendar year
will be set equal to the lesser of 2 percent of the exvessel value of retained catch in the Research Plan fisheries or
the fee percentage calculated using the equation described above and set out at &sect;677.11(a)(3). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If the fee percentage calculated using this formula is greater than 2 percent, there would be a funding shortfall due
to the 2 percent limit in the Magnuson Act. This would require a reevaluation of the levels of coverage that would be
required and funded. Available funds would be utilized to address the Research Plan objectives in the following priority:
(1) Status of stock assessments (i.e., collection of data on total catch, species composition, size, sex, and age);
(2) inseason management; (3) bycatch monitoring; and (4) vessel incentive programs and regulatory compliance.

Fee Assessments 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Processors would be responsible for collecting all fee assessments and for paying them bimonthly (i.e., every 2 months).
Section 313 of the Magnuson Act stipulates that fees shall be assessed against all fishing vessels and U.S. fish processors
participating in Research Plan fisheries under the jurisdiction of the Council, including those not required to
have observers. Fee assessments would not apply to fish, except halibut, caught in the territorial sea (0&hyph;3
miles), or to any fish caught in internal waters of the State. Recordkeeping and reporting requirement changes that
would require processors to indicate if fish are caught in Federal or State waters will be developed prior to implementation
of the fee collection system. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Catcher vessels would be expected to pay half of the fee liabilities on their retained catches to the processor(s)
responsible for making the bimonthly fee assessment payments to NMFS. NMFS would calculate bimonthly fee assessments
by multiplying the fee percentage times the standard exvessel price times the round weight or round-weight equivalent
of all retained catches, by species, in Research Plan fisheries. For example, if the fee percentage for Research Plan
fisheries were 1.00 percent, and the standard exvessel price of pollock were $0.09/lb ($0.20/kg), a retained catch
of 500,000 lbs (227,727 kg) of pollock would result in a fee assessment due from the processor of:

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Retained catch is defined as the catch retained by either at-sea or shoreside processors. The round weight of fish
delivered to shoreside processors would be determined from scale weights. Standard product recovery rates would
be used to derive round-weight equivalents when other than whole fish is delivered to shoreside processors. Standard
product recovery rates also would be used to calculate round-weight equivalents of groundfish and halibut harvested
by or delivered to at-sea processors. For crab at-sea processors, scale weights of sample catches would be used to
calculate weight of retained catch. NMFS is developing a regulatory amendment to establish standard product recovery
rates that would be used throughout the industry to calculate round-weight equivalents of retained catch. Assuming
Secretarial approval, NMFS anticipates that standard product recovery rates will be effective by 1995. If a more
reliable system for determining total weights is implemented in the future, these regulations would be amended accordingly.
Public comment is specifically encouraged on this aspect of the proposed Research Plan. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
NMFS would obtain values for the weight of retained catch to be used in calculating fee assessments through existing
data reporting systems. Groundfish data would be obtained from Weekly Production Reports or from ADF&amp;G fish
tickets for those vessel operators who are not required to submit Weekly Production Reports under Federal regulations
but who sell catch directly to consumers. Crab data would be obtained from ADF&amp;G Weekly Processor Reports, fish
tickets, or other required reports. Halibut data would be obtained from the IPHC or from Individual Fishing Quota
(IFQ) reports, when available. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
NMFS would bill processors bimonthly for their fee assessments. The bimonthly periods would be determined on the
basis of weekly reporting periods. NMFS is preparing a rule to revise the definition of a weekly reporting period.
Assuming its approval, the 1995 bimonthly periods would be January 1 through February 25; February 26 through April
29; April 30 through July 1; July 2 through September 2; September 3 through October 28; and October 29 through December
31. The Director, Alaska Region, NMFS, (Regional Director) would need to receive payments within 30 days of the date
the bill is issued. Interest and administrative charges would be charged for late payments. Payments would be deposited
in the Fund within the U.S. Treasury. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A processor would be required to notify the Regional Director, in writing, within 30 days of issuance of the bill, if
any billed amount is disputed. The processor would be responsible for paying the undisputed amount of the bill within
30 days of its issuance, and for providing documentation supporting the disputed amount claimed to be under- or over-billed.
Within 60 days of the date of issuance of the disputed bill, the Regional Director would review the disputed bill and
the documentation provided by the processor, and would notify the processor of his determination. If the Regional
Director determines a billing error has occurred, the processor's account would be rectified by credit or subsequent
billing. If the Regional Director determines a billing error has not occurred, the balance of the disputed bill would
be due within 15 days of issuance of the determination. Interest and administrative charges would be assessed for
payments that are not received within 15 days. Processor permits would not be issued until all fee assessments are
paid. (See Permit and Recordkeeping Requirements in this preamble).

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Council recommended requiring guarantees equal to the maximum estimated quarterly fee assessment for the upcoming
calendar year to secure anticipated fee liabilities, in the form of prepayments, letter of credit, surety bond, or
lien on property. NMFS believes that the requirement of such guarantees is premature and could be burdensome to the
industry, particularly to smaller enterprises, and costly to administer. Small or marginally profitable enterprises
could have difficulty in securing such guarantees. There are irrecoverable costs associated with guarantees such
as letters of credit and surety bonds. Some guarantees may be of limited value in ensuring necessary cash flows and
achieving the objectives of the Research Plan. Collection could also be difficult to accomplish in a timely and cost-effective
manner.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Instead, NMFS is proposing a simplified system to encourage timely fee assessment payments by processors that would
consist of: (1) Bimonthly billing, (2) semi-annual processor permitting with a requirement that all Research Plan
fee assessments must be current before a permit would be issued, (3) a prohibition against processing landings from
Research Plan fisheries without a valid processing permit, and (4) a prohibition against delivery of catch from Research
Plan fisheries to a processor not possessing a valid processing permit. This system also has the advantage of greatly
simplified reporting and recordkeeping requirements for processors and reduced administrative costs for NMFS.
The extent of nonpayment of fee assessments, which is inherent in any fee collection system, would be taken into account
in determining the fee percentage rate for the following year. The proposed system is designed to minimize such nonpayment.

First Year of the Research Plan
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
During the first, or start-up, year of the Research Plan, NMFS would accumulate necessary start-up funds in the Fund.
Fees would be assessed against all fishing vessels and U.S. fish processors participating in Research Plan fisheries
under the authority of the Council. Processors would be responsible for collecting all fee assessments and for paying
them bimonthly. The observer coverage requirements in the Federal Observer Plan and existing State Bering Sea and
Aleutian Islands area king and Tanner crab regulations (5 AAC 39.645) would remain in effect during the start-up year.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
During the first year of the Research Plan (1995), all processors and vessels participating in Research Plan fisheries
would pay the full fee assessment. Vessel operators and processors that currently are required to carry observers
under the Federal Observer Plan and under State regulations would continue to do so during the first year of the Research
Plan. NMFS would issue rebates to those who paid directly for required observer coverage during the first year of the
Research Plan. The rebate per standard observer day would equal either the actual payment to an observer contractor
per standard observer day or the standardized cost of a standard observer day, whichever is less. A standard observer
day is defined as all or part of a 24-hour period that begins at 0001 hours Alaska local time (A.l.t.) and ends at 2400
A.l.t., during which an observer is stationed on a vessel or at a shoreside facility for purposes of complying with
observer coverage requirements set forth in the proposed rule at &sect;677.10(a). A standard observer day cannot
be attributed to more than one vessel or shoreside facility.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The standardized cost of a standard observer day would be based on the estimate(s) of the cost per observer day used
to calculate both the total cost of the Research Plan and the fee percentage during 1995. Proposed standardized cost(s)
will be published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 for public review and comment as part of the annual Research Plan specification process set forth at &sect;677.11
of the proposed rule. At this time, NMFS anticipates that standardized cost(s) could range between $170 and $265 per
day, depending on whether 100 percent or 30 percent observer coverage is obtained.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The rebates issued for vessel or processor observer coverage may exceed Research Plan fee payments. However, issuance
of a rebate to a processor would be dependent on the processor being current with respect to submitting its fee payments.
The rebates would be based on information provided to NMFS by observer contractors on an Observer Coverage Rebate
Application (Form FPP&hyph;2). This information would include the number of standard observer days paid for by each
vessel or processor and the amount paid for those observer days. The required information would be submitted by each
observer contractor within 15 days after the end of each calendar month in which it received payments for providing
observers. Initial rebates would not be issued before mid-year, to allow for the collection of sufficient funding
for the rebate program. Subsequent rebates for 1995 observer coverage would be issued on a more regular basis, e.g.
bimonthly.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
NMFS believes that a fund equal to approximately two-thirds of the estimated annual cost needed to operate the Research
Plan is the minimum amount needed to begin full operation of the Research Plan and to ensure that cash flow is adequate
to meet start-up costs. Assuming approval of regulations implementing the Research Plan, full implementation of
the observer and fee portions of the Research Plan is anticipated to begin January 1, 1996.

Permit and Recordkeeping Requirements
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
After the first year of the Research Plan, most of the burden of recordkeeping would rest with processors, who would
be responsible for collecting and paying the bimonthly Research Plan fee assessment when billed by NMFS. During the
first year of the Research Plan, additional reporting requirements would be implemented for observer contractors
to support the rebate program for direct observer costs. The rebate program and associated recordkeeping requirements
are described above.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
All processors of Research Plan fisheries would need a Federal Processing Permit. A Federal Processing Permit Application
(Form FPP&hyph;1) would be required to obtain a processing permit, and would serve to gather information about the
processor and its owner. Fishermen who sell their catch directly to the public at a dock, roadside, or elsewhere would
be considered processors under the Research Plan. Each processing vessel or shoreside facility would be required
to submit a separate permit application, even if several vessels or facilities are owned by the same company.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Permits would be issued for each of the two 6-month periods_January 1 through June 30, and July 1 through December 31.
No permit would be issued until the permit application is complete and all fee assessments paid. Processors that have
paid their accounts and submitted complete permit applications would be issued a permit within 30 days. Permits would
not be issued to those processors not submitting complete applications or to those whose accounts are past due, until
their applications are complete and their accounts are paid. Processing fish from Research Plan fisheries without
a valid permit, or delivering fish from Research Plan fisheries to a processor not possessing a valid permit, would
be prohibited. NMFS would make available to the public a list of those processors holding valid permits to process
fish from Research Plan fisheries.

Observer Coverage
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
During the first year of the Research Plan (1995), observer coverage levels in the groundfish fishery would be as currently
required by the Federal Observer Plan. All king and Tanner crab catcher/processors and mothership processors in
the Bering Sea and Aleutian Islands area would continue to carry observers under the State Shellfish Onboard Observer
Program. Observer coverage would not be required for the halibut fishery.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Starting with the second year of the Research Plan (1996), NMFS would annually determine the level of observer coverage
necessary to achieve the objectives of the Research Plan. NMFS would consider the amount of available funds, as well
as the objectives of the program, in determining the appropriate observer coverage levels. NMFS would annually present
an analysis of observer coverage, including criteria for selection of vessels to carry observers if coverage is less
than 100 percent, to the Council, and to the State in the case of the Bering Sea and Aleutian Islands area king and Tanner
crab fisheries. NMFS would then publish the proposed levels of coverage in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 and invite comments. State costs for observer coverage in the Bering Sea and Aleutian Islands area king and Tanner
crab fisheries allowable under the Magnuson Act would be paid from fees collected from all Research Plan fisheries.
After considering comments received and again consulting with the Council, and with the State in the case of the Bering
Sea and Aleutian Islands area king and Tanner crab fisheries, NMFS would publish the final levels of observer coverage
for the upcoming year in the

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Regional Director may increase or decrease the observer coverage requirements for the groundfish, halibut,
and crab observer programs at any time during the effective period of the Research Plan to improve the accuracy, reliability,
and availability of observer data, and to ensure solvency of the observer program, so long as the conditions set forth
in section 313 of the Magnuson Act are met, and based on one or more of the following findings:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. A significant change in fishing methods, times, or areas for a specific fishery or fleet component has occurred,
or is likely to occur.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. A significant change in catch or bycatch composition for a specific fishery or fleet component has occurred, or

4. An increase in observer coverage is necessary to ensure or improve data availability or quality in order to meet
specific fishery management objectives. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Any decrease in observer coverage due to unanticipated funding shortfalls must be consistent with the following
priorities: (a) Status of stock assessments (i.e., collection of data on total catch, species composition, size,
sex, and age); (b) inseason management; (c) bycatch monitoring; and (d) vessel incentive programs and regulatory
compliance. Any increased costs must be commensurate with the quality and usefulness of the data to be derived from
any revised program and necessary to meet fishery management needs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Regional Director would consult with the Commissioner of ADF&amp;G prior to making inseason changes in observer
coverage level for the crab observer program. NMFS would publish changes in observer coverage requirements in the

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->

Groundfish and Halibut Observers 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Groundfish and halibut observers would be either employees of NMFS or employees of NMFS observer contractors. Observer
contracts would be subject to a competitive bid process and would comply with Federal and agency procurement regulations.
A minimum of three contractors would be used in accordance with the procurement regulations, if cost effective, and
if three or more bidders are qualified. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Observers would possess the education and specific training as specified in the contracts issued by the Federal Government
to provide groundfish or halibut observers. The observers' duties are described in detail in the NMFS observer manual,
which is updated as necessary and is available from the NMFS Observer Program, Alaska Fisheries Science Center, 7600
Sand Point Way N.E., BIN C15700, Building 4, Seattle, WA 98115. Observer duties may include the collection of data
on catch, effort, bycatch, and discards of finfish and shellfish, including prohibited species catches, to facilitate
inseason management. Observers may collect information on gear, processing, or other fishing information; biological
samples to determine species, length, weight, age, sex composition of catch, and predator-prey interactions; or
any other information needed to manage the fisheries. They may collect data on marine mammals, seabirds, and other
species as appropriate. Information obtained from observers would also be used to monitor compliance with fishing
and related regulations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Regional Director would review fishery monitoring programs and report to the Council on methods to improve data
collection and sampling techniques and to provide for real-time data transmission from the groundfish and halibut
fleet, including daily reporting and other measures as appropriate to improve the accuracy and efficiency of fishery
monitoring programs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A final rule was published on April 29, 1994, (59 FR 22133) that authorizes NMFS to disclose specified observer data
on prohibited species bycatch or bycatch rates. This authority would continue under the Research Plan and is included
in this proposed rule (&sect;677.10(f)).

Crab observers would either be employees of ADF&amp;G, or employees of NMFS observer contractors. The observers
would be required to possess the education and specific training requirements as specified in the contracts issued
by the Federal Government to provide crab observers. The observers' duties are described in detail in the ADF&amp;G
observer manual, which will be updated as necessary. The ADF&amp;G observer manual is available from ADF&amp;G,
Box 308, Dutch Harbor, AK 99692&hyph;0308. Crab observer duties may include the collection of data on catch, effort,
bycatch, and discards of finfish and shellfish to facilitate inseason management. Observers may also collect biological
samples to determine information such as species, length, weight, age, sex composition of catch, predator-prey
interactions, or any other biological information needed to manage the fisheries. They may also collect data on marine
mammals, seabirds, and other species as appropriate. Crab observers also provide an effective means to ensure management
compliance. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The State would review its fishery monitoring and data transmission programs in conjunction with NMFS, to coordinate
methods to improve data collection and sampling techniques, provide for real-time data transmission from the fleet,
including daily reporting, improve the accuracy and efficiency of fishery monitoring programs, and improve coordination
between State and Federal agencies. Initially, data collection, transmission, and input programs would be the same
as specified under existing State regulations and guidelines to facilitate inseason management.

Notification of Observer Contractors by Processors and Operators of Vessels Required To Carry Observers 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Processors and operators of vessels required to carry observers under the Research Plan would be responsible for
meeting their observer coverage requirements. To ensure that an observer will be available, processors and vessel
operators would be required to notify the appropriate agency or observer contractor, as identified by NMFS, not less
than 60 days prior to their need for an observer. This notification must be in writing or facsimile copy. A second notification
to the appropriate observer contractor, in writing, facsimile copy, or by telephone, must be made not less than 10
days prior to the need for an observer, to make final arrangements for observer deployment. Proposed ports from which
observers may embark/disembark are Akutan, Atka, Beaver Inlet, Chignik, Cordova, Craig, Dutch Harbor, Homer, Juneau,
Ketchikan, Kenai, King Cove, Kodiak, Petersburg, Sand Point, Seward, Sitka, St. George, St. Paul, Valdez, Wrangell,
and Yakutat. Ports were selected using the following criteria: (1) Previous selection by observer contractors,
(2) accessibility and transportation costs, and (3) availability of overnight accommodations. Public comments
on this list of ports is specifically encouraged. This list would be reviewed annually by NMFS, in consultation with
the Council and the State, during the annual budget review process. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
During the first year of the Research Plan (1995), observer coverage requirements would be as described in &sect;677.10(a).
NMFS would publish subsequent observer coverage requirements, along with the names of the observer contractors,
information for contacting contractors, and a list of embarkment/disembarkment ports for observers, annually
in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->

Coordination Between the Federal Groundfish Observer Program and the State King and Tanner Crab Observer Program
Under the Research Plan 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Under authority of the FMP for the Commercial King and Tanner Crab Fisheries in the Bering Sea and Aleutian Islands,
the State king and Tanner crab observer program for the Bering Sea and Aleutian Islands area was designed by the Board
and is administered by ADF&amp;G. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
NMFS and ADF&amp;G would form a work group to maximize efficiency in administration and implementation of the groundfish,
halibut, and king and Tanner crab observer programs. The University of Alaska, as an observer training entity, would
be a member of this work group when required to help in the development of observer training and debriefing procedures.
The work group would review costs and identify possible cost-saving measures, including the use of contractors to
perform some or all of the duties under the Research Plan, other than briefing or debriefing. The work group also would
review the costs and benefits of training observers in Alaska or elsewhere. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The work group would address items including: (1) Development of consistent, cost-effective, and compatible observer
training and debriefing procedures; (2) development of a consistent data collection, transmission, and processing
system, including a single database available to both agencies on a real-time basis; and (3) identification of costs
that are appropriate for reimbursement to the State pursuant to the Magnuson Act. NMFS and ADF&amp;G would annually
provide to the Council a report detailing steps taken to improve overall coordination between the two observer programs
and to improve administrative efficiency.

portions of the Research Plan. NMFS, with the assistance of ADF&amp;G, would annually provide Research Plan reports
and budget documents to the Committee. The Committee would consist of industry representatives from the following
groups: Factory trawler, catcher trawler, shoreside processor, crab catcher vessel, freezer longliner, non-freezer
longliner, crab catcher-processor, vessels under 60 ft (18.3 m) in length overall, observers, observer contractors,
and an independent observer training representative. The Committee would meet with NMFS and ADF&amp;G staff within
the annual cycle of the Research Plan to review the reports and budgets and provide input to the Council on fee levels
and observer coverage needs. The Committee would not have oversight of the daily operations of the Federal and State
observer programs.

The General Counsel of the Department of Commerce certified to the Small Business Administration that this proposed
rule, if adopted, would not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. Although
it would affect all firms in the Research Plan fisheries, it would not decrease revenues by more than 2 percent. Since
costs are approximately equal to revenues in the Research Plan fisheries, costs are not expected to go up by more than
2 percent. Thus, while a substantial number of small entities would be affected, the effect is not expected to be economically
significant. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This proposed rule contains collection-of-information requirements subject to the Paperwork Reduction Act. These
collections of information have been submitted to the Office of Management and Budget for approval. Public reporting
burden for each year of this collection is estimated to average 0.5 hours per response for completing the semi-annual
Federal Processing Permit Application, 0.25 hours per response for notifying contractors of needs for observers,
and 1.0 hour per response to provide information to document claims of disputed bills. For the first year of the Research
Plan, completion of Observer Coverage Rebate Application forms is estimated to average 0.16 hours per response.
All reporting burden estimates include the time for reviewing instructions, searching existing data sources, gathering
and maintaining the data needed, and completing and reviewing the collection of information. Send comments regarding
these burden estimates, or any other aspect of the data requirements, including suggestions for reducing the burden,
to NMFS (see 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
ADDRESSES

) and to the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs, Office of Management and Budget, Washington, DC 20503 (ATTN:
NOAA Desk Officer). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This proposed rule has been determined to be not significant for purposes of E.O. 12866.

Disputed fee assessments. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A processor must notify the Regional Director, in writing, within 30 days of issuance of the bimonthly fee assessment
bill, if any portion of the bimonthly fee assessment bill is disputed. The processor must pay the undisputed amount
of the bimonthly fee assessment bill within 30 days of its issuance, and provide documentation supporting the disputed
portion claimed to be under- or over-billed. The Regional Director will review the disputed bimonthly fee assessment
bill and the documentation provided by the processor, and will notify the processor of his determination within 60
days of the date of issuance of the disputed bimonthly fee assessment bill. If the Regional Director determines a billing
error had occurred, the processor's account will be rectified by credit or issuance of a corrected bimonthly fee assessment
bill. If the Regional Director determines that a billing error had not occurred, the balance of the disputed bimonthly
fee assessment bill is due within 15 days of issuance of the determination. Late charges will be assessed for payments
not received within 15 days. If the processor does not dispute the amount of the bimonthly fee assessment bill within
30 days of its issuance, the bimonthly fee assessment will be final, and will be due to the United States.

The NOAA Office of the Comptroller shall assess late charges in the form of interest and administrative charges for
late payment of fee assessments. Interest will accrue on the unpaid amount at a percentage rate established by the
Federal Reserve Board and applied to funds held by the U.S. Treasury for each 30-day period, or portion thereof, that
the payment is overdue.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Magnuson Fishery Conservation and Management Act (Magnuson Act) requires that a council-prepared amendment
to a fishery management plan be submitted to the Secretary for review and approval, disapproval, or partial disapproval.
The Magnuson Act also requires that the Secretary, upon receiving an amendment, immediately publish a notice that
the document is available for public review and comment. The Secretary will consider public comment in determining
approvability of the amendment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Amendment 7 proposes the following actions. (1) The eastern zone commercial quota for the Gulf migratory group of
king mackerel would be divided into equal quotas for Florida east and west coast fisheries. The Florida east coast
sub-zone would encompass the waters off the east coast of Florida from a line extending directly east from the Volusia/Flagler
County, Florida boundary (29
<!-- PJG 0017 degreeslatlong -->
&cir;25
<!-- PJG 0020 minuteslatlong -->
&rsquo;N. lat.) to a line extending directly east from the Dade/Monroe County, Florida boundary (25
<!-- PJG 0017 degreeslatlong -->
&cir;20.4
<!-- PJG 0020 minuteslatlong -->
&rsquo;N. lat.). The east coast sub-zone would exist from November 1 through March 31, when the boundary separating
the Gulf and Atlantic migratory groups of king mackerel is a line extending directly east from the Volusia/Flagler
County, Florida boundary. From November 1 through March 31, the Florida west coast sub-zone would encompass the waters
off the southeast, south, and west coasts of Florida from the Dade/Monroe County, Florida boundary to a line extending
directly south from the Alabama/Florida boundary (87
<!-- PJG 0017 degreeslatlong -->
&cir;31
<!-- PJG 0020 minuteslatlong -->
&rsquo;06
<!-- PJG 0020 minuteslatlong -->
&rsquo;
<!-- PJG 0020 minuteslatlong -->
&rsquo;&hyph;W. long.). From April 1 through October 31, when the boundary separating the Gulf and Atlantic migratory
groups of king mackerel is a line extending directly west from the Monroe/Collier County, Florida boundary (25
<!-- PJG 0017 degreeslatlong -->
&cir;48
<!-- PJG 0020 minuteslatlong -->
&rsquo;N. lat.), the west coast sub-zone would extend from the Monroe/Collier County, Florida boundary to the Alabama/Florida
boundary. (2) The west coast sub-zone quota would be further subdivided into equal quotas for fishermen harvesting
with hook-and-line and those using run-around gillnet gear. (3) Persons would be allowed to fish under the gillnet
quota in the west coast sub-zone only aboard vessels that have endorsements on their Federal commercial mackerel
permits to fish with gillnets in that sub-zone. All harvest of Gulf group king mackerel in the west coast sub-zone by
vessels with such an endorsement would be counted against the gillnet quota.

Proposed regulations to implement Amendment 7 are scheduled for publication within 15 days.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
The Civilian Agency Acquisition Council and the Defense Acquisition Regulations Council are proposing changes
to the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) to amend FAR policies and clauses on Prompt Payment. This proposed rule,
in combination with changes made by Federal Acquisition Circular 84&hyph;45, dated March 31, 1989, will complete
the implementation of changes made in OMB Circular A&hyph;125 (Revised), dated December 12, 1989, to comply with
the Prompt Payment Act Amendments of 1988 (Public Law 100&hyph;496). Changes are also proposed to clarify, simplify,
and correct inconsistencies in the existing FAR text and clauses. This regulatory action was not subject to Office
of Management and Budget review pursuant to Executive Order No. 12866 dated September 30, 1993.

A. Background
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Federal Acquisition Circular (FAC) 84&hyph;45 published a final FAR rule in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 at 54 FR 13332, March 31, 1989, to implement changes required by the Prompt Payment Act Amendments of 1988 (Public Law
100&hyph;496). The Office of Management and Budget (OMB) implemented the statutory requirements by revising OMB
Circular A&hyph;125, Prompt Payment. The Circular was published as a final rule in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 on December 21, 1989, and became effective 30 days after publication. OMB's final guidance differed somewhat from
earlier proposed coverage which served as the basis for the FAR changes published in FAC 84&hyph;45. This proposed
FAR rule implements the guidance published in OMB Circular A&hyph;125 (Revised).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Major FAR changes proposed include: (1) Clarifying policy on partial payments for partial performance by establishing
coverage at FAR 32.102(d) and 32.903(f); (2) revising and adding definitions at FAR 32.902 to be in consonance with
definitions in OMB Circular A&hyph;125 and to make related editorial changes; (3) adding coverage at FAR 32.904 to
address an ongoing problem with contracts containing more than one set of payment terms; (4) clarifying policy at
FAR 32.905(a)(1)(ii) concerning use of extended acceptance periods; (5) adding coverage at FAR 32.905(c)(6) to
address construction prime contractor certification requirements under the clause at FAR 52.232&hyph;5; (6) adding
coverage at FAR 32.905(j) to address the use and payment of ``mixed'' invoices; (7) adding coverage at FAR 32.907&hyph;1(b)(3)
concerning interest penalties in relation to electronic funds transfers; (8) adding coverage at FAR 32.907&hyph;1(g)
concerning additional interest penalties and contractor demands for such penalties; (9) adding coverage at FAR
32.910 to address construction contractors' payment of interest on unearned amounts under the clauses at FAR 52.232&hyph;5
and 52.232&hyph;27; and (10) revising the clause at FAR 52.232&hyph;5 to include the specific criteria required
by A&hyph;125 for construction contractors' requests for progress payments. FAR clauses 52.232&hyph;5, 52.232&hyph;8,
and 52.232&hyph;25, 52.232&hyph;26, 52.232&hyph;27, and 52.232&hyph;28 are amended to reflect the proposed FAR
text changes. In addition, numerous changes are proposed to clarify, simplify, and correct inconsistencies in the
existing FAR text and clauses. (Note: The requirements that no late payment penalty payments be made to certain foreign
vendors were removed from the FAR by FAC 90&hyph;20, Item XIII, March 10, 1994, 59 FR 11368.)

B. Regulatory Flexibility Act
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposed changes to FAR 32.102, subpart 32.9, and related part 52 clauses at 52.232&hyph;5, 52.232&hyph;8, 52.232&hyph;25,
52.232&hyph;26, 52.232&hyph;27, and 52.232&hyph;28 may have a significant economic impact on a substantial number
of small entities within the meaning of the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 601, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et seq.,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 because the proposed rule will apply to all small businesses who contract with the Federal Government and to all small
businesses who enter into construction contracts with contractors holding prime Federal construction contracts.
An Initial Regulatory Flexibility Analysis (IRFA) has been prepared and will be provided to the Chief Counsel for
Advocacy for the Small Business Administration. A copy of the IRFA may be obtained from the FAR Secretariat. Comments
are invited. Comments from small entities concerning the affected FAR subparts will also be considered in accordance
with 5 U.S.C. 610. Such comments must be submitted separately and should cite 5 U.S.C. 601,

(d) Partial payments for accepted supplies and services that are only a part of the contract requirements are authorized
under section 305 of the Federal Property and Administrative Services Act (41 U.S.C. 255). OMB Circular A&hyph;125,
Prompt Payment, requires agencies to pay for partial delivery of supplies or partial performance of services unless
specifically prohibited by the contract. Although partial payments are generally treated as a method of payment
and not as a method of contract financing, using partial payments can assist contractors to participate in Government
contracts without, or with minimal, contract financing. When appropriate, contract statements of work and pricing
arrangements shall be designed to permit acceptance and payment for discrete portions of the work, as soon as accepted
(but see 32.903(f)(2)).

 as used in this subpart, means calendar day, including weekends and holidays, unless otherwise indicated. (However,
see 32.903(e)(3) concerning payments due on Saturdays, Sundays, and legal holidays.)
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Designated billing office,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 as used in this subpart, means the office or person (governmental or nongovernmental) designated in the contract
where the contractor first submits invoices and contract financing requests. This might be the Government disbursing
office, contract administration office, office accepting the supplies delivered or services performed by the contractor,
contract audit office, or a nongovernmental agent. In some cases, different offices might be designated to receive
invoices and contract financing requests.

Discount for prompt payment
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 means an invoice payment reduction voluntarily offered by the contractor, in conjunction with the clause at 52.232&hyph;8,
Discounts for Prompt Payment, if payment is made by the Government prior to the due date. The due date is calculated
from the date of the contractor's invoice. If the contractor has not placed a date on the invoice, the due date is calculated
from the date the designated billing office receives a proper invoice, provided the agency annotates such invoice
with the date of receipt at the time of receipt. When the discount date falls on a Saturday, Sunday, or legal holiday
when Federal Government offices are closed and Government business is not expected to be conducted, payment may be
made on the following business day and a discount may be taken.

Policy.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(a) All solicitations and contracts subject to this subpart shall specify payment procedures, payment due dates,
and interest penalties for late invoice payment.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) The Government shall not make invoice and contract financing payments earlier than 7 days prior to the due dates
specified in the contract unless the agency head, or designee, determines to make earlier payment on a case-by-case
basis (see 32.908 for required clauses).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) Payment will be based on receipt of a proper invoice or contract financing request and satisfactory contract performance.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(d) Agency procedures shall ensure that, when specifying due dates, full consideration is given to the time reasonably
required by Government officials to fulfill their administrative responsibilities under the contract.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(e)(1) Checks shall be mailed on the same day they are dated.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
specified payment date
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
) for settlement at a Federal Reserve Bank on or before the established due date.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) When the due date falls on a Saturday, Sunday, or legal holiday when Federal Government offices are closed and Government
business is not expected to be conducted, payment may be made on the following business day without incurring a late
payment interest penalty.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(f)(1) Contracting officers shall, where the nature of the work permits, write contract statements of work and pricing
arrangements that allow contractors to deliver, and receive invoice payments for, discrete portions of the work
as soon as completed and found acceptable by the Government (see 32.102(d)).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Unless specifically prohibited by the contract, the contractor is entitled to payment for accepted partial deliveries
of supplies or partial performance of services that comply with all applicable contract requirements and for which
prices can be calculated from the contract terms.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Under some types of contracts, such as many cost-reimbursement contracts, partial payments cannot be made because
the invoice price cannot be determined until after settlement of total contract costs and other contract-wide final
arrangements. However, interim payments or contract financing payments may be made in accordance with the terms
of the contract.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(g) Discounts for prompt payment offered by the contractor shall be taken only when payments are made within the discount
period specific by the contractor.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(h) Agencies shall pay an interest penalty, without request from the contractor, for late invoice payments or improperly
taken discounts for prompt payment. The interest penalty shall be absorbed within funds available for administration
or operation of the program for which the penalty was incurred. The temporary unavailability of funds to make a timely
payment does not relieve an agency from the obligation to pay interest penalties or the additional interest penalties
discussed in 32.903(i) and 32.907&hyph;1(g).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) For contracts awarded after October 1, 1989, if the interest penalty is not paid within 10 days after it is due and
the contractor makes a written demand for payment within 40 days after payment of the principal amount due, agencies
shall pay an additional penalty amount, which shall be calculated in accordance with 32.907&hyph;1(g).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(j) If the contractor has assigned a contractor identifier (such as an invoice number) to an invoice or financing request,
each payment shall use the contractor identifier (in addition to any Government or contract information) in describing
any payment made.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) May prescribe additional standards for establishing due dates on voice payments (32.905) and contract financing
payments (32.906) necessary to support agency programs and foster prompt payment to contractors;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) May adopt different payment procedures to accommodate unique circumstances, provided such procedures are consistent
with the policies in this subpart; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) Shall inform contractors of points of contact within their cognizant payment offices to enable contractors to
obtain status of invoices.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) Contracting officers, in drafting solicitations and contracts, shall identify for each contract line item number,
subline item number, or exhibit line item number_
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Which of the applicable Prompt Payment clauses applies to each item when the solicitation or contract contains
items which will be subject to different payment terms; and
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) The applicable Prompt Payment food category (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
i.e.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, which item numbers are meat or meat food products, which are perishable agricultural commodities, etc.), when using
the clause at 52.232&hyph;25 which contains multiple payment terms for various classes of foods and edible products.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(a) Except as prescribed in paragraphs (b), (c), and (d) of this section, the due date for making an invoice payment
by the designated payment office shall be as follows:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) The 30th day after the designated billing office has received a proper invoice from the contractor (except as provided
in paragraph (a)(2) of this section); or the 30th day after Government acceptance of supplies delivered or services
performed by the contractor, whichever is later.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(ii) For the sole purpose of computing an interest penalty that might be due the contractor, Government acceptance
shall be deemed to have occurred constructively on the 7th day after the contractor has delivered supplies or performed
services in accordance with the terms and conditions of the contract, unless there is a disagreement over quantity,
quality, or contractor compliance with a contract requirement. In the event that actual acceptance occurs within
the constructive acceptance period, the determination of an interest penalty shall be based on the actual date of
acceptance. The constructive acceptance requirement does not, however, compel Government officials to accept
supplies or services, perform contract administration functions, or make payment prior to fulfilling their responsibilities.
Except in the case of a contract for the purchase of a commercial item or service as defined in 15.804&hyph;3(c)(3),
including a brand name commercial item for authorized resale (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
e.g., 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
commissary items), the contracting officer may specify a longer period for constructive acceptance in the solicitation
and resulting contract, if required to afford the Government a reasonable opportunity to inspect and test the supplies
furnished or to evaluate the services performed. The contract file shall indicate the justification for extending
the constructive acceptance period beyond 7 days. Extended acceptance periods shall not be a routine agency practice
but shall be used only when necessary to permit proper Government inspection and testing of the supplies delivered
or services rendered.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) If the contract does not require submission of an invoice for payment (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
e.g., 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
periodic lease payments), the due date will be as specified in the contract.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) If the designated billing office fails to annotate the invoice with the actual date of receipt at the time of receipt,
the invoice payment due date shall be the 30th day after the date of the contractor's invoice, provided a proper invoice
is received and there is no disagreement over quantity, quality, or contractor compliance with contract requirements.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) The due date for making payments on contracts that contain the clause at 52.232&hyph;10, Payments under Fixed-Price
Architect-Engineer Contracts, shall be as follows:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) The due date for work or services completed by the contractor shall be the later of the following two events:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) The 30th day after the designated billing office has received a proper invoice from the contractor.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) The 30th day after Government acceptance of the work or services completed by the contractor. On a final invoice
where the payment amount is subject to contract settlement actions (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
e.g., 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
release of claims), acceptance shall be deemed to have occurred on the effective date of the settlement. For the sole
purpose of computing an interest penalty that might be due the contractor, Government acceptance shall be deemed
to have occurred constructively on the 7th day after the contractor has completed the work or services in accordance
with the terms and conditions of the contract (see also paragraph (b)(4) of this section). In the event that actual
acceptance occurs within the constructive acceptance period, the determination of an interest penalty shall be
based on the actual date of acceptance.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) The due date for progress payments shall be the 30th day after Government approval of contractor estimates of work
or services accomplished. For the sole purpose of computing an interest penalty that might be due the contractor,
Government approval shall be deemed to have occurred constructively on the 7th day after contractor estimates have
been received by the designated billing office (see also paragraph (b)(4) of this section). In the event that actual
approval occurs within the constructive approval period, the determination of an interest penalty shall be based
on the actual date of approval.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) If the designated billing office fails to annotate the invoice or payment request with the actual date of receipt
at the time of receipt, the payment due date shall be the 30th day after the date of the contractor's invoice or payment
request, provided a proper invoice or payment request is received and there is no disagreement over quantity, quality,
or contractor compliance with contract requirements.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) The constructive acceptance and constructive approval requirements described in paragraphs (b)(1) and (b)(2)
of this section are conditioned upon receipt of a proper payment request and no disagreement over quantity, quality,
contractor compliance with contract requirements, or the requested progress payment amount. These requirements
do not compel Government officials to accept work or services, approve contractor estimates, perform contract administration
functions, or make payment prior to fulfilling their responsibilities. The contracting officer may specify a longer
period for constructive acceptance or constructive approval, if required to afford the Government a reasonable
opportunity to inspect and test the supplies furnished or to evaluate the services performed.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) The due date for making payments on construction contracts shall be as follows:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) The due date for making progress payments based on contracting officer approval of the estimated amount and value
of work or services performed, including payments for reaching milestones in any project, shall be 14 days after receipt
of a proper payment request by the designated billing office. If the designated billing office fails to annotate the
payment request with the actual date of receipt at the time of receipt, the payment due date shall be the 14th day after
the date of the contractor's payment request, provided a proper payment request is received and there is no disagreement
over quantity, quality, or contractor compliance with contract requirements. The contracting officer may specify
a longer period in the solicitation and resulting contract if required to afford the Government a reasonable opportunity
to adequately inspect the work and to determine the adequacy of the contractor's performance under the contract.
The contract file shall indicate the justification for extending the due date beyond 14 days. The contracting officer
or his representative shall not approve progress payment requests unless the certification and substantiation
of amounts requested are provided as required by the clause at 52.232&hyph;5, Payments under Fixed-Price Construction
Contracts.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) The due date for payment of any amounts retained by the contracting officer in accordance with the clause at 52.232&hyph;5,
Payments under Fixed-Price Construction Contracts, shall be as specified in the contract or, if not specified, 30
days after approval by the contracting officer for release to the contractor. This release of retained amounts shall
be based on the contracting officer's determination that satisfactory progress has been made.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) The due date for final payments based on completion and acceptance of all work (including any retained amounts),
and payments for partial deliveries that have been accepted by the Government (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
e.g., 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

(i) Either the 30th day after receipt by the designated billing office of a proper invoice from the contractor, or the
30th day after Government acceptance of the work or services completed by the contractor, whichever is later. If the
designated billing office fails to annotate the invoice with the actual date of receipt at the time of receipt, the
invoice payment due date shall be the 30th day after the date of the contractor's invoice, provided a proper invoice
is received and there is no disagreement over quantity, quality, or contractor compliance with contract requirements.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) On a final invoice where the payment amount is subject to contract settlement action (

release of contractor claims), acceptance shall be deemed to have occurred on the effective date of the contract settlement.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) For the sole purpose of computing an interest penalty that might be due the contractor for payments described in
paragraph (c)(3)(i) of this section, Government acceptance or approval shall be deemed to have occurred constructively
on the 7th day after the contractor has completed the work or services in accordance with the terms and conditions of
the contract (see also paragraph (c)(5) of this section). In the event that actual acceptance occurs within the constructive
acceptance period, the determination of an interest penalty shall be based on the actual date of acceptance.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5) The constructive acceptance and constructive approval requirements described in paragraph (c)(4) of this section
are conditioned upon receipt of a proper payment request and no disagreement over quantity, quality, contractor
compliance with contract requirements, or the requested amount. These requirements do not compel Government officials
to accept work or services, approve contractor estimates, perform contract administration functions, or make payment
prior to fulfilling their responsibilities. The contracting officer may specify a longer period for constructive
acceptance or constructive approval in the solicitation and resulting contract, if required to afford the Government
a reasonable opportunity to adequately inspect the work and to determine the adequacy of the contractor's performance
under the contract.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(6) Construction prime contracts contain special provisions concerning prime contractor payments to subcontractors,
along with special prime contractor certification requirements. The Office of Management and Budget has determined
that these certifications are not to be construed as final acceptance of the subcontractor's performance. The certification
in 52.232&hyph;5(c) implements this determination; however, certificates are still acceptance if the contractor
deletes paragraph (c)(4) of 52.232&hyph;5.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(d) Due dates for payments of contractor invoices for meat, meat food products, or fish; perishable agricultural
commodities; and dairy products, edible fats or oils, and food products prepared from edible fats or oils are as follows:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) For meat or meat food products, as defined in section 2(a)(3) of the Packers and Stockyard Act of 1921 (7 U.S.C. 182(3)),
as further defined in Public Law 98&hyph;181, including any edible fresh or frozen poultry meat, any perishable poultry
meat food product, fresh eggs, and any perishable egg product, as close as possible to, but not later than, the 7th day
after product delivery.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) For fresh or frozen fish, as defined in section 204(3) of the Fish and Seafood Promotion Act of 1986 (16 U.S.C. 4003(3)),
will be as close as possible to, but not later than, the 7th day after product delivery.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) For perishable agricultural commodities, as defined in section 1(4) of the Perishable Agricultural Commodities
Act of 1930 (7 U.S.C. 499a(4)), as close as possible to, but not later than, the 10th day after product delivery, unless
another date is specified in the contract.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) For dairy products, as defined in section 111(e) of the Dairy Production Stabilization Act of 1983 (7 U.S.C. 4502(e)),
edible fats or oils, and food products prepared from edible fats or oils, as close as possible to, but not later than,
the 10th day after the date on which a proper invoice has been received. Liquid milk, cheese, certain processed cheese
products, butter, yogurt, ice cream, mayonnaise, salad dressings, and other similar products, fall within this
classification. Nothing in the Act limits this classification to refrigerated products. When questions arise about
the proper classification of a specific product, prevailing industry practices should be followed in specifying
a contract payment due date. The burden of proof that a classification of a specific product is, in fact, prevailing
industry practice is upon the bidder making the representation.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(e) A proper invoice must include the items listed in paragraphs (e)(1) through (e)(8) of this section. If the invoice
does not comply with these requirements, the contractor must be notified of the defect within 7 days after receipt
of the invoice at the designated billing office (3 days on contracts for meat, meat food products, or fish; 5 days on
contracts for perishable agricultural commodities, dairy products, edible fats or oils, and food products prepared
from edible fats or oils). The reason that the invoice is not a proper invoice must be specified. If such notice is not
timely, then an adjusted due date for the purpose of determining an interest penalty, if any, will be established in
accordance with 32.907&hyph;1(b).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Name and address of the contractor.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Invoice date. (Contractors are encouraged to date invoices as close as possible to the date of mailing or transmission.)

the designated payment office by the 5th working day after Government acceptance or approval, unless other arrangements
have been made. This period of time does not extend the due dates prescribed in 32.905. Acceptance should be completed

as a minimum, include the following:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

Government certified invoice must also contain the information described in paragraphs (f)(1) through (f)(6) of
this section.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(g) When a discount for prompt payment is to be taken, payment will be made as close as possible to, but not later than,
the end of the discount period. Payment terms are specified in the clause at 52.232&hyph;8, Discounts for Prompt Payment.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(h) The designated billing office shall immediately annotate each invoice with the actual date it receives the invoice.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

(b) The interest penalty computation shall not include_
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) The time taken by the Government to notify the contractor of a defective invoice, unless it exceeds the periods
prescribed in 32.905(e);
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) The time taken by the contractor to correct the invoice. If the designated billing office failed to notify the contractor
of a defective invoice within the periods prescribed in 32.905(e), the due date on the corrected invoice will be adjusted
by subtracting from such date the number of days taken beyond the prescribed notification of defects period. Any interest
penalty owed the contractor will be based on this adjusted due date; and
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) The period between the date of an attempted electronic funds transfer and the date the contractor furnishes correct
electronic funds transfer data; 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
provided,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 the Government notifies the contractor of the defective data within 7 days after the Government receives notice that
the transfer could not be completed because of defective data.

(d) The interest penalty shall be at the rate established by the Secretary of the Treasury under section 12 of the Contract
Disputes Act of 1978 (41 U.S.C. 611) that is in effect on the day after the due date, except where the interest penalty
is prescribed by other governmental authority (e.g., tariffs). The rate in effect on the day after the due date shall
remain fixed during the period for which an interest penalty is calculated. This rate is referred to as the ``Renegotiation
Board Interest Rate,'' and it is published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 semiannually on or about January 1 and July 1. Information concerning this interest rate can be obtained from the Department
of the Treasury, Finance Management Branch, Washington, DC 20227, telephone (202) 208&hyph;1515. Interest calculations
shall be based upon a 360-day year. The interest penalty will accrue daily on the invoice payment amount approved by
the Government and be compounded in 30-day increments inclusive from the first day after the due date through the payment
date. That is, interest accrued at the end of any 30-day period will be added to the approved invoice payment amount
and be subject to interest penalties if not paid in the succeeding 30-day period. The interest penalty amount, interest
rate and the period for which the interest penalty was computed, will be separately stated by the designated payment
office on the check, in accompanying remittance advice, or for Electronic Funds Transfer (EFT) by an appropriate
electronic or other remittance advice. Adjustments will be made by the designated payment office for errors in calculating
interest penalties.

(C) State that payment of the principal has been received, including the date of receipt.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) Demands must be postmarked on or before the 40th day after payment was made, except that_
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(A) If the postmark is illegible or nonexistent, the demand must have been received and annotated with the date of receipt
by the designated payment office on or before the 40th day after payment was made, or
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(B) If the postmark is illegible or nonexistent and the designated payment office fails to make the required annotation,
the demand's validity will be determined by the date the contractor has placed on the demand; 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, such date is no later than the 40th day after payment was made.

(3)(i) The additional penalty shall be equal to 100 percent of any original late payment interest penalty that is due

(B) After January 22, 1992, the additional penalty shall not exceed $5,000;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(C) The additional penalty shall never be less than $25.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) If the interest penalty ceases to accrue in accordance with the limits stated in paragraphs (e) (1) and (2) of this
section, the amount of the additional penalty shall be calculated on the amount of interest penalty that would have
accrued in the absence of these limits, but shall not exceed the limits specified in paragraph (g)(3)(i) of this section.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) For determining the maximum and minimum additional penalties, the test shall be the interest penalty due on
each separate payment made for each separate contract. The maximum and minimum additional penalty shall not be based
upon individual invoices unless the invoices are paid separately. Where payments are consolidated for disbursing
purposes, the maximum and minimum additional penalty determination shall be made separately for each contract therein.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iv) The additional penalty does not apply to payments regulated by other Government regulations (for example, payments
under utility contracts subject to tariffs and regulation).

(a) The Payments under Fixed-Price Construction clause (52.232&hyph;5), paragraph (d), and Prompt Payment for
Construction Contracts clause (52.232&hyph;27), subparagraph (e)(6), provide for the contractor to pay interest
on unearned amounts in certain circumstances. This interest shall be recovered from subsequent payments to the contractor.
Therefore, no demand for payment shall normally be made. Contracting officers shall_
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Compute the amount in accordance with the clause;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Provide the contractor with a final decision; and
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Notify the payment office of the amount to be withheld.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) The payment office shall be responsible for making the deduction of interest. Amounts collected in accordance
with these provisions shall revert to the Treasury of the United States.

time of receipt. For the purpose of computing the discount earned, payment shall be considered to have been made on
the date which appears on the payment check or the date on which an electronic funds transfer is specified for settlement
at a Federal Reserve Bank. When the discount date falls on a Saturday, Sunday, or legal holiday when Federal Government
offices are closed and Government business is not expected to be conducted, payment may be made on the following business

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
(a) As authorized in 32.905(a)(1)(ii), the Contracting Officer may modify the date in subdivision (a)(5)(i) of this
clause to specify a period longer than 7 days for constructive acceptance, if required to afford the Government a reasonable
opportunity to inspect and test the supplies furnished or evaluate the services performed, except in the case of a
contract for the purchase of a commercial item or service as defined in FAR 15.804&hyph;3(c)(3), including a brand-name
commercial item for authorized resale (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
e.g.,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
 commissary items).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) As prescribed in 32.906(a), and only as allowed under agency policies and procedures, the Contracting Officer
may insert in paragraph (b) of the clause a period shorter than 30 days (but not less than 7 days) for making contract
financing payments.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
Notwithstanding any other payment clause in this contract, the Government will make invoice payments and contract
financing payments under the terms and conditions specified in this clause. Payment shall be considered as being
made on the day a check is dated or the date of an electronic funds transfer. Definitions of pertinent terms are set forth
in Federal Acquisition Regulation 32.902. All days referred to in this clause are calendar days, unless otherwise
specified. (However, see paragraph (a)(4) of this clause concerning payments due on Saturdays, Sundays, and legal
holidays.)

(i) Except as indicated in subparagraph (a)(2) and paragraph (c) of this clause, the due date for making invoice payments
by the designated payment office shall be the later of the following two events:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(A) The 30th day after the designated billing office has received a proper invoice from the Contractor (except as provided
in paragraph (a)(1)(ii) of this clause).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(B) The 30th day after Government acceptance of supplies delivered or services performed by the Contractor. On a final
invoice where the payment amount is subject to contract settlement actions, acceptance shall be deemed to have occurred
on the effective date of the contract settlement.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) If the designated billing office fails to annotate the invoice with the actual date of receipt, at the time of receipt,
the invoice payment due date shall be the 30th day after the date of the Contractor's invoice; 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
provided 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
 a proper invoice is received and there is no disagreement over quantity, quality, or Contractor compliance with contract
requirements.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(A) For meat or meat food products, as defined in section 2(a)(3) of the Packers and Stockyard Act of 1921 (7 U.S.C. 182(3)),
as further defined in Public Law 98&hyph;181, including any edible fresh or frozen poultry meat, any perishable poultry
meat food product, fresh eggs, and any perishable egg product, as close as possible to, but not later than, the 7th day
after product delivery.

as close as possible to, but not later than, the 7th day after product delivery.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(C) For perishable agricultural commodities, as defined in section 1(4) of the Perishable Agricultural Commodities
Act of 1930 (7 U.S.C. 499a(44)), as close as possible to, but not later than, the 10th day after product delivery, unless
another date is specified in the contract.

(D) For dairy products, as defined in section 111(e) of the Dairy Production Stabilization Act of 1983 (7 U.S.C. 4502(e)),
edible fats or oils, and food products prepared from edible fats or oils, as close as possible to, but not later than,
the 10th day after the date on which a proper invoice has been received. Liquid milk, cheese, certain processed cheese
products, butter, yogurt, ice cream, mayonnaise, salad dressings, and other similar products, fall within this
classification. Nothing in the Act limits this classification to refrigerated products. When questions arise about
the proper classification of a specific product, prevailing industry practices will be followed in specifying a
contract payment due date. The burden of proof that a classification of a specific product is, in fact, prevailing
industry practice is upon the bidder making the representation.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

The Contractor shall prepare and submit invoices to the designated billing office specified in the contract. A proper
invoice must include the items listed in subdivisions (a)(3)(i) through (a)(3)(viii) of this clause. If the invoice
does not comply with these requirements, the Contractor will be notified of the defect within 7 days after receipt
of the invoice at the designated billing office (3 days for meat, meat food products, or fish; 5 days for perishable
agricultural commodities, edible fats or oils, and food products prepared from edible fats or oils). Untimely notification
will be taken into account in computing any interest penalty owed the Contractor in the manner described in subparagraph
(a)(5) of the clause.

(4) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
Interest penalty.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
 An interest penalty shall be paid automatically by the designated payment office, without request from the Contractor,
if payment is not made by the due date and the conditions listed in subdivisions (a)(4)(i) through (a)(4)(iii) of this
clause are met, if applicable. However, when the due date falls on a Saturday, Sunday, or legal holiday when Federal
Government offices are closed and Government business is not expected to be conducted, payment may be made on the following
business day without incurring a late payment interest penalty.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) A proper invoice was received by the designated billing office.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) A receiving report or other Government documentation authorizing payment was processed and there was no disagreement
over quantity, quality, or contractor compliance with any contract term or condition.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) In the case of a final invoice for any balance of funds due the Contractor for supplies delivered or services performed,
the amount was not subject to further contract settlement actions between the Government and the Contractor.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
Computing penalty amount.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
 The interest penalty shall be at the rate established by the Secretary of the Treasury under section 12 of the Contract
Disputes Act of 1978 (41 U.S.C. 611) that is in effect on the day after the due date, except where the interest penalty
is prescribed by other governmental authority (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
e.g.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
, tariffs). This rate is referred to as the ``Renegotiation Board Interest Rate,'' and it is published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
 semiannually on or about January 1 and July 1. The interest penalty shall accrue daily on the invoice payment amount
approved by the Government and be compounded in 30-day increments inclusive from the first day after the due date through
the payment date. That is, interest accrued at the end of any 30-day period will be added to the approved invoice payment
amount and be subject to interest penalties if not paid in the succeeding 30-day period. If the designated billing
office failed to notify the Contractor of a defective invoice within the periods prescribed in subparagraph (a)(3)
of this clause, the due date on the corrected invoice will be adjusted by subtracting from such date the number of days
taken beyond the prescribed notification of defects period. Any interest penalty owed the Contractor will be based
on this adjusted due date. Adjustments will be made by the designated payment office for errors in calculating interest
penalties.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) For the sole purpose of computing an interest penalty that might be due the Contractor, Government acceptance
shall be deemed to have occurred constructively on the 7th day (unless otherwise specified in this contract) after
the Contractor delivered the supplies or performed the services in accordance with the terms and conditions of the
contract, unless there is a disagreement over quantity, quality, or contractor compliance with a contract provision.
In the event that actual acceptance occurs within the constructive acceptance period, the determination of an interest
penalty shall be based on the actual date of acceptance. The constructive acceptance requirement does not, however,
compel Government officials to accept supplies or services, perform contract administration functions, or make
payment prior to fulfilling their responsibilities.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) The following periods of time will not be included in the determination of an interest penalty:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(A) The period taken to notify the Contractor of defects in invoices submitted to the Government, but this may not exceed
7 days (3 days for meat, meat food products, or fish; 5 days for perishable agricultural commodities, dairy products,
edible fats or oils, and food products prepared from edible fats or oils).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(B) The period between the defects notice and resubmission of the corrected invoice by the Contractor.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(C) The period between the date of an attempted electronic funds transfer and the date the Contractor furnishes correct
electronic funds transfer data; provided, the Government notifies the Contractor of the defective data within 7
days after the Government receives notice that the transfer could not be completed because of defective data.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) Interest penalties will not continue to accrue after the filing of a claim for such penalties under the clause
at 52.233&hyph;1, Disputes, or for more than 1 year. Interest penalties of less than $1 need not be paid.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
(iv) Interest penalties are not required on payment delays due to disagreement between the Government and Contractor
over the payment amount or other issues involving contract compliance or on amounts temporarily withheld or retained
in accordance with the terms of the contract. Claims involving disputes, and any interest that may be payable, will
be resolved in accordance with the clause at 52.233&hyph;1, Disputes.

An interest penalty shall also be paid automatically by the designated payment office, without request from the Contractor,
if a discount for prompt payment is taken improperly. The interest penalty will be calculated as described in subparagraph
(a)(5) of this clause on the amount of discount taken for the period beginning with the first day after the end of the
discount period through the date when the Contractor is paid.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(A) Is owed an interest penalty;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(B) Is not paid the interest penalty within 10 days after the date the invoice amount is paid; and

the maximum and minimum additional penalty determination shall be made separately for each contract therein.

Interest penalty.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
 An interest penalty shall be paid automatically by the designated payment office, without request from the Contractor,
if payment is not made by the due date and the conditions listed in subdivisions (a)(3)(i) through (a)(3)(iii) of this
clause are met, if applicable. However, when the due date falls on a Saturday, Sunday, or legal holiday when Federal
Government offices are closed and Government business is not expected to be conducted, payment may be made on the following
business day without incurring a late payment interest penalty.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) A proper invoice was received by the designated billing office.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) A receiving report or other Government documentation authorizing payment was processed and there was no disagreement
over quantity, quality, Contractor compliance with any contract term or condition, or requested progress payment
amount.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

(iii) In the case of a final invoice for any balance of funds due the Contractor for work or services performed, the amount
was not subject to further contract settlement actions between the Government and the Contractor.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
Computing penalty amount.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
 The interest penalty shall be at the rate established by the Secretary of the Treasury under section 12 of the Contract
Disputes Act of 1978 (41 U.S.C. 611) that is in effect on the day after the due date, except where the interest penalty
is prescribed by other governmental authority (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
e.g.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
, tariffs). This rate is referred to as the ``Renegotiation Board Interest Rate,'' and it is published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
 semiannually on or about January 1 and July 1. The interest penalty shall accrue daily on the invoice payment amount
approved by the Government and be compounded in 30-day increments inclusive from the first day after the due date through
the payment date. That is, interest accrued at the end of any 30-day period will be added to the approved invoice payment
amount and be subject to interest penalties if not paid in the succeeding 30-day period. If the designated billing
office failed to notify the Contractor of a defective invoice within the periods prescribed in subparagraph (a)(2)
of this clause, the due date on the corrected invoice will be adjusted by subtracting from such date the number of days
taken beyond the prescribed notification of defects period. Any interest penalty owed the Contractor will be based
on this adjusted due date. Adjustments will be made by the designated payment office for errors in calculating interest
penalties.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) For the sole purpose of computing an interest penalty that might be due the Contractor, Government acceptance
or approval shall be deemed to have occurred constructively as shown in subdivisions (a)(4)(i) (A) and (B) of this
clause. In the event that actual acceptance or approval occurs within the constructive acceptance or approval period,
the determination of an interest penalty shall be based on the actual date of acceptance or approval. Constructive
acceptance or constructive approval requirements do not apply if there is a disagreement over quantity, quality,
Contractor compliance with a contract provision, or requested progress payment amounts. These requirements also
do not compel Government officials to accept work or services, approve Contractor estimates, perform contract administration
functions, or make payment prior to fulfilling their responsibilities.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(A) For work or services completed by the Contractor, Government acceptance shall be deemed to have occurred constructively
on the 7th day after the Contractor has completed the work or services in accordance with the terms and conditions of
the contract.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(B) For progress payments, Government approval shall be deemed to have occurred on the 7th day after Contractor estimates
have been received by the designated billing office.

(B) The period between the defects notice and resubmission of the corrected invoice by the Contractor.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
provided
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
, the Government notifies the Contractor of the defective data within 7 days after the Government receives notice
that the transfer could not be completed because of defective data.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) Interest penalties will not continue to accrue after the filing of a claim for such penalties under the clause
at 52.233&hyph;1, Disputes, or for more than 1 year. Interest penalties of less than $1 need not be paid.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iv) Interest penalties are not required on payment delays due to disagreement between the Government and Contractor
over the payment amount or other issues involving contract compliance, or on amounts temporarily withheld or retained
in accordance with the terms of the contract. Claims involving disputes, and any interest that may be payable will
be resolved in accordance with the clause at 52.233&hyph;1, Disputes.

Contractor, if a discount for prompt payment is taken improperly. The interest penalty will be calculated on the amount
of discount taken for the period beginning with the first day after the end of the discount period through the date when
the Contractor is paid.

Notwithstanding any other payment terms in this contract, the Government will make invoice payments and contract

Types of invoice payments
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
. For purposes of this clause, there are several types of invoice payments which may occur under this contract, as follows:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) Progress payments, if provided for elsewhere in this contract, based on Contracting Officer approval of the estimated
amount and value of work or services performed, including payments for reaching milestones in any project:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(A) The due date for making such payments shall be 14 days after receipt of the payment request by the designated billing
office. If the designated billing office fails to annotate the payment request with the actual date of receipt, at
the time of receipt, the payment due date shall be the 14th day after the date of the Contractor's payment request, provided
a proper payment request is received and there is no disagreement over quantity, quality, or Contractor compliance
with contract requirements.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(B) The due date for payment of any amounts retained by the Contracting Officer in accordance with the clause at 52.232&hyph;5,
Payments Under Fixed-Price Construction Contracts, shall be as specified in the contract or, if not specified, 30
days after approval for release to the Contractor by the Contracting Officer.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) Final payments based on completion and acceptance of all work and presentation of release of all claims against
the Government arising by virtue of the contract, and payments for partial deliveries that have been accepted by the
Government (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
e.g.,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
 each separate building, public work, or other division of the contract for which the price is stated separately in
the contract):
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(A) The due date for making such payments shall be either the 30th day after receipt by the designated billing office
of a proper invoice from the Contractor, or the 30th day after Government acceptance of the work or services completed
by the Contractor, whichever is later. If the designated billing office fails to annotate the invoice with the date
of actual receipt, at the time of receipt, the invoice payment due date shall be the 30th day after the date of the Contractor's
invoice, provided a proper invoice is received and there is no disagreement over quantity, quality, or Contractor
compliance with contract requirements.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(B) On a final invoice where the payment amount is subject to contract settlement actions (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
e.g.,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->

invoice must include the items listed in subdivisions (a)(2)(i) through (a)(2)(ix) of this clause. If the invoice
does not comply with these requirements, the Contractor will be notified of the defect within 7 days after receipt
of the invoice at the designated billing office. Untimely notification will be taken into account in computing any
interest penalty owed the Contractor in the manner described in subparagraph (a)(4) of this clause:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) Name and address of the Contractor.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

Interest penalty.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
 An interest penalty shall be paid automatically by the designated payment office, without request from the Contractor,
if payment is not made by the due date and the conditions listed in subdivisions (a)(3)(i) through (a)(3)(iii) of this
clause are met, if applicable. However, when the due date falls on a Saturday, Sunday, or legal holiday when Federal
Government offices are closed and Government business is not expected to be conducted, payment may be made on the following
business day without incurring a late payment interest penalty.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) A proper invoice was received by the designated billing office.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

over quantity, quality, Contractor compliance with any contract term or condition, or requested progress payment
amount.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) In the case of a final invoice for any balance of funds due the Contractor for work or services performed, the amount

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
Computing penalty amount.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
 The interest penalty shall be at the rate established by the Secretary of the Treasury under section 12 of the Contract
Disputes Act of 1978 (41 U.S.C. 611) that is in effect on the day after the due date, except where the interest penalty
is prescribed by other governmental authority (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
e.g.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
, tariffs). This rate is referred to as the ``Renegotiation Board Interest Rate,'' and it is published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
 semiannually on or about January 1 and July 1. The interest penalty shall accrue daily on the invoice payment amount
approved by the Government and be compounded in 30-day increments inclusive from the first day after the due date through
the payment date. That is, interest accrued at the end of any 30-day period will be added to the approved invoice payment
amount and be subject to interest penalties if not paid in the succeeding 30-day period. If the designated billing
office failed to notify the Contractor of a defective invoice within the periods prescribed in subparagraph (a)(2)
of this clause, the due date on the corrected invoice will be adjusted by subtracting from such date the number of days
taken beyond the prescribed notification of defects period. Any interest penalty owed the Contractor will be based
on this adjusted due date. Adjustments will be made by the designated payment office for errors in calculating interest
penalties.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) For the sole purpose of computing an interest penalty that might be due the Contractor for payments described in
subdivision (a)(1)(ii) of this clause, Government acceptance or approval shall be deemed to have occurred constructively
on the 7th day after the Contractor has completed the work or services in accordance with the terms and conditions of
the contract. In the event that actual acceptance or approval occurs within the constructive acceptance or approval
period, the determination of an interest penalty shall be based on the actual date of acceptance or approval. Constructive
acceptance or constructive approval requirements do not apply if there is a disagreement over quantity, quality,
or Contractor compliance with a contract provision. These requirements also do not compel Government officials
to accept work or services, approve Contractor estimates, perform contract administration functions, or make payment
prior to fulfilling their responsibilities.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) The following periods of time will not be included in the determination of an interest penalty:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(A) The period taken to notify the Contractor of defects in invoices submitted to the Government, but this may not exceed
7 days.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(B) The period between the defects notice and resubmission of the corrected invoice by the Contractor.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(C) The period between the date of an attempted electronic funds transfer and the date the Contractor furnishes correct
electronic funds transfer data; provided, the Government notifies the Contractor of the defective data within 7
days after the Government receives notice that the transfer could not be completed because of defective data.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) Interest penalties will not continue to accrue after the filing of a claim for such penalties under the clause
at 52.233&hyph;1, Disputes, or for more than 1 year. Interest penalties of less than $1 need not be paid.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iv) Interest penalties are not required on payment delays due to disagreement between the Government and Contractor
over the payment amount or other issues involving contract compliance, or on amounts temporarily withheld or retained
in accordance with the terms of the contract. Claims involving disputes, and any interest that may be payable, will
be resolved in accordance with the clause at 52.233&hyph;1, Disputes.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
 An interest penalty shall also be paid automatically by the designated payment office, without request from the Contractor,
if a discount for prompt payment is taken improperly. The interest penalty will be calculated on the amount of discount
taken for the period beginning with the first day after the end of the discount period through the date when the Contractor
is paid.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(C) For determining the maximum and minimum additional penalties, the test shall be the interest penalty due on each

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 Pursuant to the authority set forth in section 407 of the Agricultural Act of 1949, as amended (7 U.S.C. 1427), and Executive
Order 11336, notice is being given that I have determined that:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
1. The chronic economic distress of the needy members of the Devils Lake Sioux Tribe (the Tribe) of the Fort Totten Indian
Reservation of North Dakota has been materially increased and become acute because of excessive rains in the summer
of 1993, thereby creating a serious shortage of feed and causing increased economic distress. This reservation is
designated for Indian use and is utilized by members of the Tribe for grazing purposes.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. The use of feed grain or products thereof made available by CCC for livestock feed for such needy members of the Tribe
will not displace or interfere with normal marketing of agricultural commodities.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. Based on the above determinations, I hereby declare the reservation and grazing land of the Tribe to be an acute distress
area and authorize the donation of feed grain owned by the CCC to livestock owners who are determined by the Bureau of
Indian Affairs, United States Department of the Interior, to be needy members of the Tribe utilizing such lands. These
donations by the CCC may commence upon May 1, 1994, and shall be made available through May 31, 1994, or such other date
as may be stated in a notice issued by the Administrator, Agricultural Stabilization and Conservation Service.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Animal Damage Control (ADC) of the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service of the U.S. Department of Agriculture,
in cooperation with the Bureau of Land Management of the U.S. Department of the Interior, and the Forest Service of
the U.S. Department of Agriculture, has prepared a final environmental impact statement (EIS) for the ADC program.
Copies of this document were filed with the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) on April 26, 1994, pursuant to section
102(2)(c) of the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (42 U.S.C. 4332(2)(c)), and the EPA Notice of Availability

On January 14, 1993 (58 FR 4404&hyph;4405, Docket No. 92&hyph;190&hyph;1), we published a notice of intent to make
available a supplement to the draft EIS for the ADC program. The draft EIS, made available on June 18, 1990 (55 FR 24597&hyph;24598,
Docket No. 90&hyph;099), evaluated environmental impacts associated with wildlife damage control activities.

FINAL DETERMINATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 We determine that imports of aramid fiber formed of poly-phenylene terephthalamide (PPD-T aramid fiber) from the
Netherlands are being, or are likely to be, sold in the United States at less than fair value (LTFV), as provided in section
735 of the Tariff Act of 1930, as amended (the Act). The estimated weighted-average margins are shown in the ``Continuation
of Suspension of Liquidation'' section of this notice.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Since our preliminary determination on December 9, 1993 (58 FR 65699, December 16, 1993), the following events have
occurred:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On December 16, 1993, we received a request from the sole respondent in this investigation, Aramide Maatschappij
V.O.F. (Arami) and Akzo Fibers, Inc. (the U.S. selling agent) (collectively Akzo) to postpone the final determination
in this investigation until 135 days after the date of publication of the preliminary determination. On December
22, 1993, we did so and postponed this final determination until May 2, 1994 (58 FR 69329, December 30, 1993). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On February 23, 1994, petitioner (E.I. Du Pont de Nemours &amp; Company) requested that references to tire cord fabric
be deleted from the scope of the investigation. On April 21, 1994, petitioner revised its previous request, asking
that tire cord fabric be expressly excluded from the scope of this investigation. (See ``Scope of the Investigation''
section of this notice, below.) Akzo submitted supplemental responses to sections B (third-country sales), C (United
States sales) and D (cost of production/constructed value) of the questionnaire, revisions and corrections to its
sales responses, and/or revised computer tapes in December 1993, as well as February, March and April of 1994. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
We conducted verification of Akzo's sales and cost questionnaire responses in the Netherlands and the United States
in February and March of 1994, respectively.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Akzo and petitioner submitted case and rebuttal briefs on March 28 and 31, 1994, respectively. At Akzo's request,
a public hearing was held on April 1, 1994.

Scope of the Investigation
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The products covered by this investigation are all forms of poly para-phenylene terephthalamide aramid fiber from
the Netherlands. These consist of PPD-T aramid in the form of filament yarn (including single and corded), staple
fiber, pulp (wet or dry), spun-laced and spun-based nonwovens, chopped fiber and floc. Tire cord fabric is excluded
from the class or kind of merchandise under investigation. PPD-T aramid fiber is classifiable under subheadings
5402.10.3020, 5402.10.3040, 5402.32.3000, 5503.10.0000, 5601.30.0000 and 5902.10.0000 of the

Changes to the Scope of the Investigation
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Prior to our preliminary determination, petitioner requested that we clarify that ``tire cord fabric'' constructed
of PPD-T aramid fiber is included within the scope of this investigation. After considering comments from both parties,
we preliminarily determined that this product is included within the scope of this investigation (58 FR 65699, December
16, 1993). We also invited comments from interested parties on this issue. Subsequent to the preliminary determination,
petitioner requested that tire cord fabric be expressly excluded from the scope of this investigation. Also, Akzo
submitted arguments opposing the inclusion of tire cord fabric. We have therefore excluded tire cord fabric from
the class or kind of merchandise covered by this investigation.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Petitioner also requested that the term ``nonwovens'', as used in the description of the scope of the investigation,
be clarified to include only spun-based and spun-laced nonwovens composed of PPD-T aramid fiber. We have made this
clarification.

Finally, at the request of the U.S. International Trade Commission, we have replaced the words ``this includes''
with the words ``these consist of'' to further clarify the products covered by this investigation.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Prior to our preliminary determination, Akzo argued that this investigation should involve at least three classes
or kinds of merchandise: Yarn, staple fiber and pulp. After considering extensive comments from both parties, we
preliminarily determined that the products covered by this investigation constitute a single class or kind of merchandise,
and three such or similar categories. (See Preliminary Concurrence Memorandum, dated December 9, 1993, on file in
room B-099 of the main building of the Department of Commerce). In our preliminary determination, we invited additional
comments from interested parties on this issue. However, no additional evidence supporting a finding of three classes
or kinds has been submitted. In addition, no comments in opposition to our preliminary determination have been filed.
We therefore continue to find that the products covered by this investigation constitute a single class or kind of
merchandise.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
We made fair value comparisons using the following such or similar categories: (1) Yarn; (2) staple fiber; and (3)
pulp. Where we were not able to compare U.S. sales to sales of identical merchandise, we made similar merchandise comparisons
on the basis of the criteria defined in Appendix V to the antidumping duty questionnaire, on file in room B-099 of the
main building of the Department of Commerce. In accordance with 19 CFR 353.58, we made comparisons at the same level
of trade, where possible.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
To determine whether Akzo's sales to the United States of PPD-T aramid fiber were made at less than fair value, we compared
the United States price (USP) to the foreign market value (FMV), as specified in the ``United States Price'' and ``Foreign
Market Value'' sections of this notice.

We calculated USP according to the methodology described in our preliminary determination, with the following exceptions:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. We included certain sales in our calculation of USP which Akzo contends were pursuant to a long-term contract negotiated
prior to the POI. (For a further discussion of these sales, see comment 1 below.) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. We increased U.S. indirect selling expenses by the amount of G&amp;A expenses allocated to the aramid fibers business
unit of Akzo Fibers Inc. by its parent company, Akzo America Inc. (see comment 6 below).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As stated in our preliminary determination, we determined that the home market was not viable for any of the three such
or similar categories. We selected Germany as the third country market for sales of yarn and staple fiber, and Japan
as the third country market for sales of pulp. We calculated FMV as noted in the ``Price-to-Price'' and ``Price to Constructed
Value (CV)'' sections of this notice.

Cost of Production
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Petitioner alleged that Akzo's third country sales were made at prices below the cost of production (COP). On the basis
of petitioners' allegations, we gathered and verified data on production costs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 We compared Akzo's third country prices to the COP as explained in our preliminary determination. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 In order to determine whether third country prices were above the COP, we calculated the COP based on the sum of Arami's
(i.e., the actual producer and seller of subject merchandise) submitted costs of materials, fabrication, general
expenses, and packing, except in the following instances where the costs were not appropriately quantified or valued:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. We recalculated interest expense based solely on Arami's financial statements (see DOC position for comment 12);

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. We included certain non-operating expenses in general and administrative (G&amp;A) expenses (see DOC position
for comment 17); and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. We disallowed Arami's claimed reduction in fixed overhead for certain intercompany charges (see DOC position
for comments 14 and 15). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 Accordingly, we increased its submitted cost of manufacturing.

Price-to-Price Comparisons
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
For those products for which we had an adequate number of sales at prices equal to or greater than the COP, we based FMV
on third country prices. We calculated FMV using the methodology described in our notice of preliminary determination,
with the following exceptions:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. We recalculated inventory carrying costs incurred in the Netherlands on German and Japanese sales and German credit
expenses to reflect the short-term borrowing rate of Arami (see comment 7 below).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. We used the average credit days of all transactions with a reported shipment and payment date for sales missing both
a shipment and payment date. We have inserted the date of the start of the Dutch sales verification for those sales with
missing payment dates only.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. We corrected a clerical error in the calculation of third country indirect selling expenses.

Price to CV Comparisons

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
For those products without an adequate number of sales at prices above the COP, we based FMV on CV. We calculated CV based
on the sum of the cost of materials, fabrication, general expenses, and U.S. packing cost. In accordance with section
773(e)(1)(B) (i) and (ii) of the Act we: (1) Included the greater of Arami's reported general expenses or the statutory
minimum of ten percent of the cost of manufacture (COM), as appropriate and; (2) for profit, we used the higher of the
statutory minimum of eight percent of the sum of COM and general expenses or the actual profit incurred as calculated
on a market specific basis (see Comment 18). As a result, for the German market we used actual profit and for the Japanese
market we used the statutory minimum of eight percent. We calculated CV based on the methodology described in the calculation
of COP above, with the following exceptions:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. In the financing calculation, we included additional interest expense based on market value (See Comment 13).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. We corrected a clerical error in the calculation of third country profit.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 In instances where we compared Akzo's U.S. prices to CV, we made deductions, where appropriate, for the weighted-average
third country direct selling expenses. We also deducted the weighted-average third country indirect selling expenses.
We limited this adjustment by the amount of indirect selling expenses incurred on U.S. sales, in accordance with 19
CFR 353.56(b)(2).

Final Determination of Critical Circumstances 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Petitioner alleged that ``critical circumstances'' exist with respect to imports of PPD-T aramid fiber from the
Netherlands. Pursuant to section 733(e)(1) of the Act and 19 CFR 353.16, we have analyzed the allegations using the
Department's standard methodology as discussed in our preliminary determination, except that for purposes of determining
whether there have been massive imports we compared imports in five-month periods rather than four-month periods
(see DOC position for comment 4). Accordingly, we find that critical circumstances do not exist.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Certain comments cannot be discussed in this notice due to their business proprietary nature. The comments which
have been excluded do not lend themselves to public summarization, and therefore have been discussed in the business
proprietary version of the Final Concurrence Memorandum dated May 2, 1994 (Final Concurrence Memorandum), on file
in room B-099 of the main building of the Department of Commerce.

Comment 1: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Petitioner argues that the Department of Commerce (the Department) should include in its calculation of U.S. price
Akzo's shipments during the POI made pursuant to a long-term agreement negotiated prior to the POI. Petitioner contends
that the particular terms and circumstances of Akzo's agreement with this customer do not create a binding commitment
on the part of either the buyer or seller and therefore do not create an enforceable sales contract. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 Akzo argues that these shipments were pursuant to a long-term contract established prior to the POI and therefore
are properly excluded from the U.S. database. Akzo further argues that certain terms and circumstances of the agreement
should not prevent it from being considered a contract with a date of sale prior to the POI because the two parties acted
upon and adhered to the contract. Finally, respondent points out that the Department confirmed at verification that
all sales to this customer during the period of the contract were at the contract price.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
DOC Position: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In order for this agreement to be considered a long-term contract established prior to the POI, the agreement must
fix both the price and quantity. At verification we examined all invoices to the customer for sales pursuant to the
agreement during its effective period. Although we found that all sales were made at the specified price, we also found
that the quantity purchased was substantially less than the amount specified in the contract.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Therefore, we conclude that the quantity was not fixed by the terms of the agreement because the quantities actually
purchased over the period of the agreement were unrelated to those specified by the agreement. For this reason, we
determine that the date of the agreement does not constitute the date of sale. Accordingly, we have used the date of
shipment as the date of sale and have included all shipments to this customer during the POI in our calculation of U.S.
price.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Comment 2: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Petitioner argues that the Department should include in its calculation of U.S. price Akzo's shipments during the
POI pursuant to a supply agreement which was signed prior to the POI but modified during the POI. Petitioner asserts
that the modification to the agreement, in effect, created a new agreement with a date of sale within the POI.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 Akzo argues that the contract modification did not alter the essential terms of the contract. Therefore, according
to Akzo, all POI shipments pursuant to this agreement have a date of sale prior to the POI and thus are properly excluded
from the U.S. sales database.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
DOC Position: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
We agree with Akzo. We verified that the essential terms of the contract, the price and quantity, were not altered as
a result of the modification. Therefore, we consider Akzo's agreement with this customer to be a long-term contract
with a date of sale prior to the POI. Consequently, the shipments in question were properly not reported.

Comment 3: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Petitioner argues that Akzo's shipments made pursuant to supply contracts with two customers during the POI should
be reported as U.S. sales, if not already reported.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 Akzo contends that these sales have been reported.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
DOC Position: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The sales in question were reported.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Comment 4: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Petitioner argues that the Department should find that imports of subject merchandise were massive over a relatively
short period of time and that consequently, critical circumstances exist in this investigation under 735 (a)(3)(B)
of the Act. In its analysis, petitioner compared shipments to the United States with a base period prior to the filing
of the petition of May-July, 1993, with shipments to the United States in the post-petition comparison period of August-October,
1993. Using this comparison, petitioner found that imports had increased during the comparison period by more than
15 percent, the Department's benchmark.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 Akzo argued that imports were not massive, and that the petitioner's methodology was not consistent with the practice
of the Department.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
DOC Position: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
We agree with Akzo. In this case, the petition was filed on July 2, 1993. It is the Department's standard policy, in cases
where the petition is filed during the first half of the month, to include the month of filing in the post-petition comparison
period, not the base period, as petitioner suggests (See, e.g., Certain Portable Electronic Typewriters from Singapore,
58 FR 43337 (1993)). Additionally, although 19 CFR 353.16(g) requires that we examine at least three months, it is
the Department's practice to examine the longest period for which information is available up until the preliminary
determination (See, e.g., Certain Cut-to-Length Carbon Steel Plate from the United Kingdom, 58 FR 37216 (1993)).
When the five month period subsequent to and including the month that the petition was filed is compared to the previous
five months, we find that imports were not at levels we consider massive.

Comment 5: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Petitioner argues that certain sales of scrap (which were excluded from our analysis in the preliminary determination
because the quantity involved was insignificant) should be included in the calculation of U.S. price for the following
reasons: (1) The fact that the quantities are small is irrelevant; (2) other sales of the merchandise in question are
included in the cost of production calculations; and (3) according to product specifications in Akzo's invoices,
the merchandise in question is clearly a form of PPD&hyph;T aramid fiber which is subject to investigation.

<!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Akzo argues that the Department properly excluded sales of scrap from its preliminary determination because the
quantities sold in the United States were small and there were no similar sales of scrap in the comparison third country
markets. Additionally, Akzo asserts that exclusion of scrap sales is consistent with the treatment of non-prime
material in the recent carbon flat steel cases, where the Department disregarded sales of second quality merchandise
in the U.S. market where there were no similar sales in the home market and they constituted an insignificant portion
(less than five percent) of the respondent's total U.S. sales, (Final Determination of Sales at Less Than Fair Value:
Certain Hot-Rolled and Certain Cold-Rolled Steel from the Netherlands, 58 FR 37199, 37201 (July 9, 1993)). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Akzo further argues that petitioner's reliance on the product designations on the invoices is misplaced because
scrap is generated as part of the beaming (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
i.e.,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
DOC Position:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 We agree with Akzo. The volume of scrap sales is insignificant and there are no comparable third country sales. Therefore,
we have continued to exclude these sales from our calculations. In addition, at verification we verified that most
of the scrap is tailings generated by the U.S. repacking operation and that, invoice descriptions notwithstanding,
the product is sold as waste and the customer has no recourse to quality claims.

Comment 6: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Petitioner argues that we should not exclude certain (G&amp;A) expenses incurred by Akzo America, Inc. in the calculation
of indirect selling expenses for purposes of the ESP deduction from U.S. price. Petitioner further argues that it
is long-standing Department practice to consider G&amp;A expenses incurred by the U.S. selling arms of a foreign
producer to be indirect ``selling expenses'' for purposes of this deduction. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Akzo argues that it has captured all expenses of the selling affiliate, Akzo Fibers, in its calculation of indirect
selling expenses. In addition, Akzo asserts that it has captured all selling-related expenses which were allocated
to the aramid fiber business unit of Akzo Fibers by Akzo America. Akzo contends that all remaining G&amp;A expenses
carried on the books of Akzo America are not associated with the selling function at Akzo Fibers and therefore are properly
not included in the calculation of U.S. indirect selling expenses.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
DOC Position: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
We agree with petitioner. Akzo America is the parent company that provides administrative, accounting and finance
services for all of Akzo's North American subsidiaries. In addition, there is no evidence that it provides any services
for Akzo N.V. (its parent company in the Netherlands) other than to facilitate the activities of the subsidiaries
in the United States. Therefore, all expenses incurred by Akzo America, including those classified on its books as
G&amp;A, are indirectly related to the selling activities of the subsidiaries. Consequently, we have included in
the calculation of U.S. indirect selling expenses the amount of Akzo America's G&amp;A expenses which have been allocated
to the aramid fibers business unit of Akzo Fibers.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Petitioner argues that certain other G&amp;A expenses listed on the June 1993 financial statement of Akzo America
have not been allocated to any of the North American subsidiaries and that the representative portion attributable
to the aramid fiber business unit should be included in the calculation of indirect selling expenses for purposes
of the ESP deduction from U.S. price.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Akzo argues that these G&amp;A costs are the same G&amp;A expenses which are the subject of Comment 6 above.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
DOC Position: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
We agree with petitioner that the G&amp;A expenses of Akzo America should be included in the calculation of indirect
selling expenses for purposes of the ESP deduction from U.S. price (see comment 6). However, we agree with Akzo that
these G&amp;A costs are the same G&amp;A expenses which are the subject of Comment 6 (see memorandum to the file, dated
April 22, 1994). Therefore, no additional increase to U.S. indirect selling expenses is necessary.

Comment 8: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Petitioner argues that in calculating the Dutch portion of U.S. inventory carrying costs, the Department should
use the short-term borrowing rate of Arami (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
i.e.,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 the actual producer and seller of the subject merchandise), rather than the rate of Akzo N.V., the parent company.
Petitioner asserts that Arami's borrowing rate is appropriate because Arami is the company which actually financed
the inventory and is a separate corporate entity from Akzo N.V.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Akzo argues that Akzo N.V.'s short-term borrowing rate should be used in calculating the Dutch portion of the inventory
carrying cost for the same reasons it argues that Akzo N.V. and Arami should be consolidated for determining a financial
expense ratio for CV and COP. (See the discussion below at Comment 11). Respondent also argues, in the event that the
Department decides not to collapse the two companies and uses Arami's short-term borrowing rate in calculating U.S.
inventory carrying cost, that the Department should also use Arami's short-term borrowing rate in the calculation
of inventory carrying costs incurred in the Netherlands on sales made in Japan and Germany and in the calculation of
German credit.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
DOC Position: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As noted in our response to Comment 11 below, we have determined that it is not appropriate to collapse Arami and Akzo
N.V. Therefore, we agree with petitioner and have used the short-term borrowing rate of Arami in calculating the inventory
carrying costs incurred in the Netherlands on U.S., German and Japanese sales. We have also applied Arami's rate in
the calculation of German credit expense, as suggested by Akzo.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Petitioner argues that Akzo's U.S. customs duty calculation may be incorrect because there are discrepancies between
the list of customs entries for subject merchandise entering Akzo's warehouses in the United States during the POI
and the list of all shipments to the United States provided by Akzo in connection with the critical circumstances allegation.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Akzo argues that petitioner has erroneously assumed that the entries included in the two lists should correspond
exactly. In fact, respondent argues, the list of shipments includes additional entries that did not enter Akzo's
warehouse but were transferred directly to U.S. customers, entries made after the POI, and invoices that were cancelled.

We agree with Akzo. The two lists will not correspond exactly. One list represents the volume of subject merchandise
entering Akzo's U.S. warehouses during the POI, while the other represents the volume of subject merchandise shipped
from the Netherlands during the POI. In addition, at verification we determined that the list of entries used for Akzo's
U.S. duty calculation was complete and accurate.

Comment 11:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Petitioner argues that Arami and Akzo N.V. should not be consolidated for COP or CV calculations. Petitioner states
that while they were clearly related, Akzo N.V. held only a 50 percent equity interest in Arami and their operations
were never consolidated for financial reporting or any other purposes. According to both Dutch and U.S. generally
accepted accounting principles (GAAP), consolidation is required when one company holds more than a 50 percent equity
interest in another company. Petitioner asserts that the reorganization of the Arami joint venture should not be
factored into the Department's cost analysis because this development occurred after the POI. Petitioner claims
that if the Department departed from its practice of investigating costs and prices during the POI, it would constitute
an arbitrary departure from established practice as well as an invitation for post-POI cost and price manipulation
by foreign producers. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Petitioner maintains that the Department's reason for collapsing transactions between related parties which do
not reflect ``arm's length'' costs is to eliminate any substantial risk of price and cost manipulation between those
companies. Petitioner states that the legal and operational structure of Arami was designed so that its operations
would not be consolidated under Dutch law. Additionally, petitioner asserts that the actual cost of producing aramid
fiber is more accurately reflected by Arami's own books and records instead of its records consolidated with the Akzo
Group. Petitioner contends that the companies in the cases cited by Arami do not relate to this case because the companies
met the requirements for consolidation and should have been consolidated under GAAP (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
i.e.,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 equity ownership was greater than 50 percent).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Arami claims that Akzo N.V. exerted significant control over its operation not only in 1993, but in all preceding years.
Arami states evidence of this close interrelationship is illustrated by its financing transactions as well as evidence
of organizational and operational control. Arami argues that it is the Department's practice to combine financing
activities of companies where one company exerts significant control over the other company. It also claims that
this is in keeping with the Department's position on fungibility of capital. Arami has informed the Department that
Akzo Fibers Aramide B.V., a wholly-owned subsidiary of Akzo N.V., increased its equity interest in Arami to 95 percent
effective December 31, 1993. Arami concludes that, based on the fungibility of capital, increased equity ownership
and significant control, the Department should consolidate Arami with Akzo N.V. for cost of production and constructed
value purposes. Arami states that it was consolidated with Akzo N.V. for balance sheet reporting purposes as of December
31, 1993, and would be fully consolidated on both the income statement and balance sheet in the fiscal year 1994. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Additionally, Arami claims that in previous cases, the Department has combined the parent and subsidiary's costs
even though consolidation did not occur in the normal course of business. In citing the Final Determination of Sales
at Less Than Fair Value: Certain Carbon Steel Butt-weld Pipe Fittings from Thailand (pipe fittings), 57 FR 21065 (1992),
respondent quotes the Department as saying: ``*&blank;*&blank;* it is the Department's policy to combine the financing
activities of a parent and subsidiary when the parent exercises control over the subsidiary (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
i.e.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 meets the requirements for consolidation).'' Respondent also cites the Final Determination of Sales at Less Than
Fair Value: Ferrosilicon from Brazil (Ferrosilicon), 59 FR 732 (1994), to further support its claim.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
We agree with petitioner, and have not consolidated Arami and Akzo N.V. for purposes of this antidumping investigation.
The corporate reorganization which was effective December 31, 1993, was not considered by the Department because
it occurred subsequent to the POI. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Each of the joint venture partners had equal control over decisions involving Arami's operations until the new agreement
was signed in 1994. Under Dutch GAAP, if a company does not have equity ownership of greater than 50 percent, but still
has control over another company, it is required to consolidate. Since Arami was not consolidated with Akzo prior
to reorganization, we can reasonably conclude that Akzo did not have sufficient control over Arami to warrant consolidation
under Dutch GAAP. Therefore, consolidation of Arami and the Akzo N.V. for antidumping purposes based on a significant
control argument is unwarranted.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In the two cases cited by Arami, the GAAP of those countries required consolidation when one company owned more than
50 percent of another. In the Pipe Fittings case, the Japanese parent company, Awaji Sangyo K.K. Company Ltd. (ASK)
owned more than 50 percent of Awaji Sangyo Co. Ltd., (AST) of Thailand. Although ASK and AST did not prepare consolidated
financial statements, the Department in its cost verification report (April 4, 1992, pg.3) noted ``*&blank;*&blank;*
the operations should have been consolidated in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.'' In
Ferrosilicon, the parent company owned greater than 50 percent of Minasligas, its subsidiary under investigation.
Brazilian and U.S. GAAP require consolidation when the equity interests exceed 50 percent. In each of those cases,
control was indicated by equity ownership and GAAP required consolidation. In contrast to the above cases, Arami
did not meet the requirements for consolidation. For further analysis of this issue, see the Final Concurrence Memorandum.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Since Arami was not consolidated with Akzo N.V. during the POI, petitioner asserts interest expense should be calculated
based solely on Arami's 1992 audited financial statements. Petitioner argues that the Department must disregard
the reorganization finalized subsequent to the POI which resulted in Arami being consolidated with Akzo N.V. for
balance sheet purposes. In addition, petitioner states this consolidation did not affect the income statement encompassing
the POI.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Arami argues that the combined 1992 financial statement data of Arami and Akzo N.V. is the correct basis for computing
interest expense because Akzo N.V. exerts significant control over Arami's operations and capital is fungible.
Arami argues that the consolidation for balance sheet purposes as of December 31, 1993, affects the entire fiscal
year 1993.

We disagree with respondent. A company's balance sheet presents a snapshot of its assets and claims on those assets
(liabilities and equity) as of a specific point in time (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
i.e.,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

i.e.,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 1/1/93-12/31/93). Arami's operating results were not consolidated with the results of the Akzo N.V. Group in 1993.
Based on the Department's decision not to consolidate Arami with Akzo N.V., we calculated interest expense for COP
and CV based solely on Arami's financial statements. For further analysis of this issue, see the Final Concurrence
Memorandum.

 Petitioner asserts that interest on loans provided by a related party should be included in the calculation of Arami's

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 965 F.2d 1056 (1992), cost of production is linked to constructed value. Thus, the petitioner states that the constructed
value provision authorizing the Department to disregard related party transactions which are not arms-length in
nature can be applied to cost of production calculations. Petitioner asserts that Arami's argument for consolidation
does not eliminate the costs associated with these loans. Furthermore, the year end reorganization does not modify
costs incurred during the POI. Petitioner contends that consolidation did not affect the income statement for the
period January 1 through December 31, 1993.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

 Arami claims that as a result of the new joint venture agreement signed in 1994, Arami's balance sheet was consolidated
with that of Akzo N.V., eliminating all related party loans. Therefore, the Department cannot impute an interest
cost to loans that do not exist as of December 31, 1993. Arami claims its 1992
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 audited financial statement data should be used in calculating interest expense, but adds that the significant change
in Arami's corporate structure must be considered. Arami continues that if the Department determines consolidation
is unwarranted, and decides imputation of interest expense is necessary for CV, it should not impute interest for
COP. Arami argues that the Department's long standing policy is to compute COP based on a company's actual costs, thus,
there is no basis on which to impute interest for COP.

 According to section 773(e)(2) of the Act, for CV, if a transaction between related companies does not fairly reflect
the market value, the Department may determine that element of value using the best evidence available. In this case,
we found that the loans in question were at below-market interest rates. Thus, we included the interest incurred on
the loans provided by Arami's related party in the calculation of financing costs for CV purposes.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
We determined that no related party financing adjustment is necessary for COP purposes. In determining actual costs
of production, the Department normally adheres to the GAAP of the respondent's home country. Under Dutch GAAP, economic
activities are normally consolidated for all companies that have direct or indirect ownership greater than 50 percent.
In accordance with ITA's standard practice, the supplier's actual costs of production should be used to value inputs
acquired from companies that are directly or indirectly related by more than 50 percent. Inputs acquired from companies
that have direct or indirect ownership of 50 percent or less, should normally be valued using transfer prices (i.e.,
purchaser's actual cost). Accordingly, for COP purposes, we used Arami's transfer prices.

 Petitioner states that certain charges were paid by Arami for services rendered by related Akzo companies. Since
certain of these charges are used to approximate the price charged in an arm's length transaction and were actual costs
incurred, Petitioner states it is appropriate to include these costs in the cost of manufacturing.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Arami claims certain of these charges are intracompany transactions which do not represent true costs and will be

We disagree with respondent. These charges relate to intercompany transactions between Arami and another company,
which represent actual costs incurred by Arami and recorded on its books during the POI. Arami incorrectly categorized
these costs as intracompany transactions which relates to transactions between divisions within a company. The
fact that this charge may be discontinued in 1994 does not mean the costs should be excluded for 1993. Accordingly,
we included these charges in Arami's COP and CV calculations.

 Petitioner states that certain costs incurred by Akzo N.V. prior to the POI and recorded in Arami's 1992 audited financial
statements in accordance with GAAP should be included in the COP. Petitioner states that this expense should be either
charged to U.S. sales as a selling expense or to all sales as a general and administrative expense.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Akzo argues that these costs incurred by Akzo N.V. do not represent true costs for Arami during the POI. The accrual
on Arami's books for this cost has not been paid to Akzo N.V. and the expense will no longer be charged in 1994. Therefore,
this intercompany transaction should be excluded from the submitted cost of manufacturing.

Petitioner asserts that the Department should disallow a certain adjustment to Arami's fixed overhead costs for
grants because it is not recorded in Arami's cost accounting system and the reduction in costs attributed to this adjustment
distorts Arami's true cost of manufacturing. Petitioner notes that if the Department allows this reduction, we should

Akzo notes that because not all grants are countervailable, the Department should resist petitioner's statements

duty law. Petitioner is free to submit a countervailing duty petition. Should such a petition be submitted and meet
the requirements of the countervailing duty regulations (19 CFR 355.12), the Department would initiate such an investigation.
However, no justification has been presented here for a departure from the Department's general policy of not self-initiating

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
On April 26, 1991, the International Trade Commission (ITC) determined that a U.S. industry was being materially
injured by reason of imports of FPDs from the Japan (56 FR 43937, Sept. 5, 1991). On September 4, 1991, the Department
published an antidumping duty order on EL FPDs (56 FR 43741).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The ITC decision was appealed, and the CIT remanded the determination to the ITC to reconsider its injury determination.
On March 8, 1993, the ITC determined on remand that no U.S. industry was being materially injured by reason of imports
of El FPDs. This remand was affirmed by the CIT on April 14, 1994,

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Accordingly, absent an appeal, or , if appealed, upon a final decision by the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit
(CAFC) affirming the CIT, the antidumping duty order will be revoked. Plaintiffs in the proceedings obtained an injunction
enjoining liquidation of entries of EL FPDs that remain unliquidated as of 5 p.m., January 24, 1994. Therefore, revocation
of the order will be effective for all entries that remain unliquidated as of the date of revocation.

 893 F.2d 337 (Fed. Cir. 1990), the CAFC held that the Department must publish notice of a decision of the CIT or the CAFC
which is not in harmony with the Department's or the ITC's respective determinations. Publication of this notice
fulfills that obligation. The CAFC also held that in such a case, the Department must suspend liquidation until there
is a final decision in the action. Therefore, the Department is continuing to suspend liquidation at the current cash
deposit rate pending the expiration of the period of appeal of, if appealed, pending a final decision of the CAFC.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 In response to a request by the respondent, the New Zealand Kiwifruit Marketing Board, the Department of Commerce
has conducted an administrative review of the antidumping duty order on fresh kiwifruit from New Zealand. The review
covers one exporter and the period November 27, 1991, through May 31, 1993. The review indicates the existence of margins
for the exporter. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As a result of this review, we preliminarily determine to assess antidumping duties equal to the difference between
the United States price and foreign market value.

Background 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
On June 2, 1992, the Department of Commerce (the Department) published the antidumping duty order on fresh kiwifruit
from New Zealand (57 FR 23203). The Department published a notice of ``Opportunity to Request Administrative Review''
on June 7, 1993 (58 FR 31941). The respondent, the New Zealand Kiwifruit Marketing Board (NZKMB), requested that we
conduct an administrative review for the period November 27, 1991, through May 31, 1993. We published a notice of ``Initiation
of Antidumping and Countervailing Duty Administrative Review'' on July 21, 1993 (58 FR 39007), announcing an administrative
review of the NZKMB. The Department has now conducted this administrative review in accordance with section 751 of
the Tariff Act of 1930, as amended (the Tariff Act). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
Scope of the Review 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The product covered by this review is fresh kiwifruit. Processed kiwifruit, including fruit jams, jellies, pastes,
purees, mineral waters, or juices made from or containing kiwifruit, are not covered under the scope of this review.
The subject merchandise is currently classifiable under subheading 0810.90.20.60 of the Harmonized Tariff Schedule
(HTS). Although the HTS number is provided for convenience and customs purposes, our written description of the scope
of this review is dispositive.

Exporter's Sales Price: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As provided in section 772(c) of the Tariff Act, we used the exporter's sales price (ESP) as U.S. price for certain sales
by the NZKMB to the United States; these sales were made to the first unrelated party in the United States after importation,
and hence warranted ESP methodology. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
We calculated ESP based on packed F.O.B. (ex-New Zealand coolstore), and packed F.O.B., freight-prepaid prices.
We made deductions, where appropriate, for New Zealand inland freight (coolstore to port), loading charges in New
Zealand, ocean freight, basic marine insurance, charter insurance, U.S. import duties, U.S. brokerage and handling,
U.S. inland freight (decreased to account for prepaid freight where applicable), and price discounts (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
i.e., 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
advertising allowances, special advertising allowances, market adjustment discounts, advertising rebates which
actually constituted discounts, and discounts for quality problems). In accordance with sections 772(e) (1) and
(2) of the Tariff Act, we made additional deductions, where appropriate, for agent commissions, broker commissions,
credit, direct advertising, and indirect selling expenses. Indirect selling expenses included inventory carrying
costs, repacking, U.S. primary and U.S. satellite coolstore charges, New Zealand and U.S. instore insurance, fire
insurance, product liability and tamper insurance, earthquake insurance, indirect advertising, quality control
expenses, miscellaneous selling-agent-related charges, U.S.-incurred indirect expenses, and New Zealand incurred
indirect selling expenses associated with selling in the United States. We increased the U.S. price to account for
post sale price adjustments not reflected in the gross price.

Purchase Price: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As provided in section 772(b) of the Tariff Act, we used purchase price to represent the U.S. price for sales made on
a CIF basis directly by the NZKMB. Deductions were made, where appropriate, for ocean freight, foreign inland freight,
and inland/marine insurance in accordance with section 772(d)(2) of the Tariff Act.

Foreign Market Value 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Department determined that home market sales did not constitute a viable basis for calculating foreign market
value (FMV). Therefore, in accordance with 19 CFR 353.48 and 353.49(b), the Department chose sales to Japan as the
basis of FMV. Japan is the largest third-country market based on information submitted by the NZKMB. Neither the petitioner
nor the respondent raised in this review any other factor relevant to third country selection, hence we did not consider
any other factor in determining the third-country market.

<!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In general, the Department relies on monthly weighted-average prices in the calculation of FMV. In consideration
of the significant volume of third-country sales involved in this review, we decided to test respondents' third-country
sales to determine whether we could use annual FMVs as a basis of comparison to U.S. sales. To determine whether a period
of review (POR) weighted-average price was representative of the transactions under consideration, we performed
a three-step test. See 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Antifriction Bearings from Japan, et al.; Final Results of Review, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
58 FR 42289 (1993). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
We first compared the monthly weighted-average third-country price for each model with the weighted-average POR
price of that model. We calculated the proportion of each model's sales whose POR weighted-average price did not vary
more than plus or minus 10 percent from the monthly weighted-average prices. We did this test for each model of kiwifruit.
We then compared the volume of sales of all models of kiwifruit whose POR weighted-average price did not vary more than
plus or minus 10 percent from the monthly weighted-average price with the total volume of sales of kiwifruit. If the
POR weighted-average price of at least 90 percent of sales of kiwifruit did not vary more than plus or minus 10 percent
from the monthly weighted-average price, we considered the POR weighted-average price to be representative of the
transactions under consideration. Finally, we tested whether there was any correlation between fluctuations in
price and time for each model. We found that no significant correlation existed between price and time (See analysis
memorandum to the file, 4/25/94). That is, prices did not consistently rise or fall so as to make annual weighted-average
prices unrepresentative of home market prices. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Because many of the NZKMB's sales were determined to be at prices below the cost of production (COP) during the investigation,
the Department initiated a COP investigation for the purposes of this administrative review. Just as the Department
found in the investigation, we find that in comparing third-country sales to COP, the reseller/exporter's acquisition
prices are irrelevant because section 773(b) of the Tariff Act requires that the Department look at the actual COP
of the subject merchandise. Thus, we used the cost incurred by kiwifruit farmers, the actual producers of the subject
merchandise, to calculate the COP benchmark. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Due to the large number of growers from which the NZKMB purchased kiwifruit during the POR, the Department determined
that sampling was both administratively necessary and methodologically appropriate to calculate a representative
cost of producing the subject merchandise for purposes of this administrative review (See section 777A of the Tariff
Act). Based on comments submitted by the petitioner and the respondent, we decided to select kiwifruit growers on
a stratified basis across the categories of regional location. Farms were stratified by geographic regions into
either the Bay of Plenty region or non-Bay of Plenty regions. This division was made because 70 percent of the New Zealand
kiwifruit is produced in the Bay of Plenty region and it is considered to be the most cost-effective area in which to
grow kiwifruit. Once farms were categorized into two geographic regions, a random sample of 20 growers was selected.
Since 70 percent of the New Zealand kiwifruit production originates in the Bay of Plenty region, we selected 14 growers
representing this region. An additional six growers were selected from the non-Bay of Plenty regions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
We sent COP questionnaires through the NZKMB to the 20 kiwifruit growers, all of which responded to the Department's
questionnaire. These 20 responses, along with supplemental responses and verification results, were analyzed
and relied upon, where appropriate, in reaching the preliminary results of the review. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
We calculated the cost of cultivation for each grower by summing all costs for the 1992 kiwifruit season. These costs
included the cost of materials, farm labor, farm overhead, and packing. We allocated the cost on a per tray-equivalent
basis over the total number of tray-equivalents submitted by each grower to the NZKMB. We then adjusted those costs
to reflect the fruit loss of 22 percent, which was disclosed by the NZKMB in its financial statement. We added the NZKMB's
general and administrative expenses to the farm's average cost per tray.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The orchard set-up costs for all growers were amortized over 20 years (See memorandum to Holly A. Kuga, 4/21/94). Because
several growers failed to provide actual orchard set-up costs, we must base our determination on the ``best information
available'' (BIA), pursuant to 19 CFR 353.37(a). For those growers that did not or could not provide actual set-up
costs, we used grower number 17's average cost per hectare, collected at verification, as BIA to calculate set-up
costs. These are the highest orchard set-up costs of the 20 growers in our sample. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For growers that allocated costs over the productive area, that is, canopy area, we made adjustments to include the
headlands and sidelands in the productive area of the kiwifruit orchard for the purpose of allocating costs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
We made adjustments to growers' cost for depreciation, interest, labor, repairs, management, vehicles, fertilizer,
spraying, rates (property tax), electricity, shelter, water, general and administrative, pruning, and mowing
on a farm-specific basis where appropriate. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For the grower that failed verification, we used BIA to determine its COP, pursuant to 19 CFR 353.37(a). This BIA was
based on the highest COP we calculated for all responding growers. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
We calculated a simple average COP from the sampled growers' individual COPs. The total COP was calculated on a New
Zealand dollar per single-layer tray equivalent basis (NZ$/SLT). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Pursuant to Department practice, in conducting our COP analysis, if over 90 percent of a respondent's sales of a particular
model were at prices above the COP, we did not disregard any below-cost sales of that model because we determined that
the respondent's below-cost sales were not made in substantial quantities, as required under section 773(b) of the
Tariff Act. See 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 57 FR 21065 (1992). If between 10 and 90 percent of a respondent's sales of a particular model were at prices above the
COP, we retained the sales above cost for analysis, and we examined the sales below cost to determine whether they occurred
over an extended period of time. Consistent with the Departments' practice, the Department disregarded those sales
made below cost if occurring in more than two months. Where we found that more than 90 percent of respondent's sales
of a model were at prices below the COP and over an extended period of time, we disregarded all home market sales of that
model and based FMV on constructed value (CV) in accordance with section 773(b) of the Tariff Act. There is no information
on the record demonstrating that prices of below cost sales would recover all costs within a reasonable period of time.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
To calculate CV, the statutory minimum profit of eight percent was added because the NZKMB's actual profit was less
than the statutory minimum (See section 773(e) of the Tariff Act). We added selling, general and administrative expenses
for the NZKMB to the farm's average cost per tray because the actual expenses were higher than the statutory minimum
of 10 percent. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
We adjusted third-country prices, where appropriate, to reflect deductions for rebates, New Zealand inland freight,
New Zealand inland freight insurance, New Zealand port loading expenses, ocean freight and charter insurance. Direct
advertising, imputed credit, and letter of credit charges were also deducted. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
We also deducted indirect selling expenses including inventory carrying costs, New Zealand instore and fire insurance,
product liability and tamper insurance, indirect advertising, and other indirect selling expenses when calculating
FMV for comparison to ESP transactions. This deduction for third country indirect selling expenses was capped by
the amount represented by U.S. indirect selling expenses plus U.S. commissions, in accordance with 19 CFR 353.56(b).

SUMMARY: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
On June 9, 1992, the Department of Commerce (the Department) received a request from Brecoflex Corporation (Brecoflex)
for a circumvention inquiry of the antidumping duty order on industrial belts and components and parts thereof, whether
cured or uncured, from Japan with respect to imports by Mectrol Corporation (Mectrol). Pursuant to that request,
the Department initiated a circumvention inquiry on October 18, 1993 (58 FR 53706). The circumvention inquiry covers
the period January 1, 1992 through June 30, 1993.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Based on a review of Brecoflex's submissions in conjunction with the International Trade Commission's (ITC) analysis
of the manufacturing process for production of industrial power belts, the Department determines that Brecoflex
does not have standing as a domestic producer of a like product to file the request in the instant inquiry. Therefore,
we are terminating the circumvention inquiry.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

Background
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
On June 14, 1989, the Department published the antidumping duty order on industrial belts and components and parts
thereof, whether cured or uncured, from Japan (54 FR 25314). On August 4, 1989, we published an amended order (54 FR
32104). On June 9, 1992, Brecoflex, who identified itself as a producer of a like product in the United States, alleged
that the antidumping duty order on industrial belts from Japan was being circumvented and requested that the Department
investigate the matter. The Department initiated a circumvention inquiry on October 18, 1993.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In several submissions, Mectrol alleged that Brecoflex did not have standing to file a request for a circumvention
inquiry. Therefore, on February 1, 1994, and February 28, 1994, the Department issued a standing questionnaire and
supplemental standing questionnaire, respectively, to Brecoflex. Brecoflex responded to the standing questionnaires
on February 17, 1994, and March 4, 1994.

Standing To File a Request for a Circumvention Inquiry
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
Section 353.29 of the Department's regulations states that ``[a]ny interested party, as defined in &sect;353.2(k),
may file'' a request for a circumvention inquiry (19 CFR 353.29). In its June 9, 1993, request for a circumvention inquiry,
Brecoflex claimed standing to bring the request as a domestic producer of industrial power belts. The provision in
the Department's regulations for standing as a producer is &sect;353.2(k)(3) which includes in the definition of
interested party ``[a] producer in the United States of the like product'' (19 CFR 353.2(k)(3)).

Brecoflex's U.S. Operations

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
In its June 9, 1992, request for a circumvention inquiry, Brecoflex claimed standing to bring the request as a producer
in the United States of a like product as covered by the antidumping duty order on industrial belts from Japan. Pursuant
to questions raised by Mectrol concerning Brecoflex's standing to bring this request for a circumvention inquiry,
the Department issued a standing questionnaire to Brecoflex. In its standing questionnaire response, Brecoflex
explained its U.S. operations as follows.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Brecoflex states that it imports from Germany polyurethane timing belts and performs secondary operations on these
belts in its only United States facility in Eatontown, New Jersey. The secondary operations consist of the following:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 02 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=15 g=1 f=2 -->
(1) Slitting of roll stock and truly endless belts to narrower belt widths;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Cutting roll stock to specific lengths;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Splicing and welding of open-ended roll stock to finished belts;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) Attaching injection molded profiles to belt backs; and
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5) Machining of finished belts such as edge grinding, removing sections of teeth, providing holes for joining belts
in linear drives, and grinding of belt back.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 02 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
Brecoflex states that it fabricates, markets and sells three basic types of synchronous polyurethane timing belts
that it considers to be subject merchandise. These belts include the Breco M, the Breco V, and the Brecoflex. Brecoflex
performs the operations listed above on these three belts. (See the Department's April 15, 1994, Recommendation
Memorandum for further detail.)

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=2 -->
Production of Industrial Power Belts
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
In its final report during the injury investigation in 1989, the ITC determined that there are four main stages in the
manufacturing of industrial power transmission belts:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Parts manufacturing,
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Assembling or building,
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Curing or vulcanizing, and
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) Finishing and packaging (see Industrial Belts from Japan, USITC Pub. 2194 (1989) (ITC Report) at 6 and 7). In addition,
the ITC Report describes the three main components of most industrial power belts: (1) A tensile member (a textile,
fiberglass, or steel cord, yarn, or fabric), which adds strength to withstand the tension imposed in transmitting
power;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) The base material (usually synthetic rubber, such as neoprene or plastics), which forms the bulk of the belt and
encloses the tensile member, and is referred to as the undercord and the overcord; and
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Adhesion material or gum, which bonds all the components together (USITC Pub. 2194 at a&hyph;2).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As discussed above, Brecoflex either sells the German belts as imported, or performs secondary operations on the
belts in preparation for sale. We determine that these secondary operations listed above do not add to the material
composition of the belts or fundamentally alter the essential nature of the merchandise as imported. Specifically,
the merchandise as imported already incorporates the three main components of industrial belts as described in the
ITC Report. Furthermore, the belting stock as imported has already undergone, before arrival in the United States,
the first three stages of the belt manufacturing process as described in the ITC Report.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As Brecoflex indicated in its request for a circumvention inquiry, the major cost in producing timing belts is incurred
in production of the belt stock from which the finished belts are made. As Brecoflex itself explained, completion
of a finished belt from belt stock requires merely slitting to width, cutting to length, and possibly die cutting to
length and welding. According to Brecoflex, these operations_the same secondary operations that Brecoflex performs
in its U.S. facility_involve some skilled labor but little in the way of machinery or capital investment. Thus, as
indicated in its submissions, Brecoflex performs only secondary operations in its U.S. facility, all of which fall
within the fourth stage of the belt manufacturing process as described in the ITC Report, i.e., finishing and packaging.
Brecoflex also markets and services the imported roll stock it sells in the United States.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Based on the above analysis and the information submitted by Brecoflex, the Department determines that Brecoflex
is not a domestic producer of industrial belts and, therefore, is not an interested party within the meaning of 19 CFR
353.2(k)(3) entitled to file a request for a circumvention inquiry. As such, the Department determines that Brecoflex
does not have standing to file a request for a circumvention inquiry against Mectrol.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=2 -->
Conclusion
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
Because Brecoflex Corporation is not a producer of industrial power belts in the United States and, therefore, does
not have standing under 19 CFR 353.2(k) to file a request for a circumvention inquiry with regard to the antidumping
duty order on industrial belts and components and parts thereof, whether cured or uncured, from Japan, the Department
hereby terminates this circumvention inquiry.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
On August 16, 1993, the Department published the final results of its administrative review of the antidumping duty
order on porcelain-on-steel cooking ware from Mexico (58 FR 43327). The review covered the period December 1, 1989
through November 30, 1990. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On August 24, 1993, we received a letter from counsel for CINSA, S.A., alleging that the Department had made ministerial
errors. Petitioner submitted rebuttals to respondent's comments on September 1, 1993. On December 23, 1993, we determined
that ministerial errors were made. (See Memorandum to Joseph A. Spetrini dated December 23, 1993; Corrections of
Alleged Clerical/Ministerial Errors in Antidumping Duty Administrative Review.) Although these final results
are the subject of litigation before the Court of International Trade (the Court), by order dated March 31, 1994, the
Court granted the Department leave to correct these errors.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
After reviewing all comments, we have corrected the errors where appropriate. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
We corrected the double counting of CINSA's freight expenses for U.S. sales by deducting only the U.S. dollar factor
amount, instead of both the dollar and pesos amounts, from U.S. prices to arrive at the net price used in our price-to-price

We recalculated the brokerage charges on U.S. sales and used the correct brokerage expense factor to derive total
brokerage charges. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
We made an additional correction. We recalculated the home market sales price used in our determination of sales below
cost by adding the value added tax to the home market price as stated in our notice of final results. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For further discussion of the Department's positions on the above corrections, see Memorandum to Joseph A. Spetrini
dated December 23, 1993; Corrections of Alleged Clerical/Ministerial Errors in Antidumping Duty Administrative
Review. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As a result of our corrections of clerical errors, we determine the margin for CINSA, S.A., to be 6.71 percent. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Based on this rate, the Department will instruct the Customs Service to collect cash deposits of estimated antidumping
duties and to assess antidumping duties on all appropriate entries in accordance with the procedures discussed in
the final results of this review (58 FR 43327). These deposit requirements, when imposed, shall remain in effect until
publication of the final results of the next administrative review. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This notice also serves as a final reminder to importers of their responsibility under 19 CFR 353.26 to file a certificate
regarding the reimbursement of antidumping duties prior to liquidation of the relevant entries during the review
period. Failure to comply with this requirement could result in the Secretary's presumption that reimbursement
of antidumping duties occurred and the subsequent 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
assessment of double antidumping duties. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This notice is in accordance with sections 751(f) of the Tariff Act of 1930, as amended (19 U.S.C. 1675(f)) and 19 CFR
353.28(c).

SUMMARY: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
In accordance with Executive Order 11625, and 15 U.S.C. 1512, the Minority Business Development Agency (MBDA) is
soliciting competitive applications under its Minority Business Development Center (MBDC) program. The total
cost of performance for the first budget period (12 months) from September 1, 1994 to August 31, 1995 is estimated at
$222,196. The total Federal Amount is $188,867 and is composed of $184,260 plus the Audit Fee Amount of $4,607. The
application must include a minimum cost-share of 15% ($33,329) of the total project cost through non-Federal contributions.
Cost-sharing contributions may be in the form of cash contributions, client fees, in-kind contributions or combinations
thereof. The MBDC will operate in the State of Connecticut geographic service area.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The funding instrument for the MBDC will be a cooperative agreement. Competition is open to individuals, non-profit
and for-profit organizations, state, and local governments, American Indian tribes and educational institutions.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The MBDC Program provides business development services to the minority business community to help establish and
maintain viable minority businesses. To this end, MBDA funds organizations to identify and coordinate public and
private sector resources on behalf of minority individuals and firms; to offer a full range of management and technical
assistance to minority entrepreneurs; and to serve as a conduit of information and assistance regarding minority
business. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Applications will be evaluated on the following criteria: The experience and capabilities of the firm and its staff
in addressing the needs of the business community in general and, specifically, the special needs of minority businesses,
individuals and organizations (50 points); the resources available to the firm in providing business development
services (10 points); the firm's approach (techniques and methodologies) to performing the work requirements included
in the application (20 points); and the firm's estimated cost for providing such assistance (20 points). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
An application must receive at least 70% of the points assigned to each evaluation criteria category to be considered
programmatically acceptable and responsive. Those applications determined to be acceptable and responsive will
then be evaluated by the Director of MBDA. Final award selections shall be based on the number of points received, the
demonstrated responsibility of the applicant, and the determination of those most likely to further the purpose
of the MBDA program. Negative audit findings and recommendations and unsatisfactory performance under prior Federal
Awards may result in an application not being considered for award. The applicant with the highest point score will
not necessarily receive the award.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
MBDCs shall be required to contribute at least 15% of the total project cost through non-Federal contributions. To
assist them in this effort, MBDCs may charge client fees for management and technical assistance (M&amp;TA) rendered.
Based on a standard rate of $50 per hour, MBDCs will charge client fees at 20% of the total cost for firms with gross sales
of $500,000 or less, and 35% of the total cost for firms with gross sales of over $500,000.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Lepidochelys olivacea
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
) turtles are listed as threatened, except for breeding populations of green turtles in Florida and on the Pacific
coast of Mexico, and the breeding population of olive ridley turtles on the Pacific coast of Mexico, which are listed
as endangered. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In 1990, the National Academy of Sciences (NAS) completed a review of the biology of sea turtles, and the causes and
significance of their decline. The NAS concluded that incidental capture in shrimp trawls without turtle excluder
devices (TEDs) is by far the leading cause of human-induced mortality to sea turtles at sea, but collectively, the
activities in the non-shrimp fisheries constitute the second largest source of mortality. The study identified
finfish trawls, seine nets, pompano gillnets, and various passive fishing gear such as sink gillnets, weirs, traps
and longlines as potential sources of mortality to sea turtles. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
NMFS is considering sea turtle conservation measures addressing incidental takings in non-shrimp fisheries. NMFS
is considering many options, including: (1) Requiring the use of nets equipped with NMFS-approved turtle excluder
devices (TEDs) at certain times of the year by non-shrimp bottom trawl fishing vessels fishing in waters of Delaware
through Texas, to protect threatened and endangered sea turtles; (2) establishing a mandatory observer requirement
in all fisheries that may take sea turtles incidental to fishing operations; and (3) providing a mechanism to allow
NMFS to respond quickly to emergency situations that threaten listed sea turtles. Through these management actions,
NMFS intends to protect endangered and threatened sea turtles in a manner that is compatible with commercial fishing
operations. NMFS intends to solicit further public comments and to hold public hearings during the rulemaking process.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
1. TED-Use Requirement 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Under the current regulations, most shrimp trawlers are required to use TEDs in inshore and offshore waters from North
Carolina through Texas. Other bottom-trawl vessels using essentially the same equipment are not required to use
TEDs, despite operating in areas with turtles. NMFS has determined that non-shrimp bottom trawlers, such as summer
flounder bottom trawlers, are as likely to capture and drown sea turtles as are shrimp trawlers. Through an interim
rule (58 FR 48797, September 20, 1993), NMFS currently requires the summer flounder fishery to use TEDs in the waters
off North Carolina and southern Virginia. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Turtle stranding and observation data suggest that turtles are found year-round off portions of North Carolina,
in the waters of Virginia and Maryland from May through December, and in New York coastal bays from July through October.
Information on turtle occurrence and capture is limited for areas north of Delaware Bay. However, NMFS is collecting
data on the possible incidental take of turtles in the North Atlantic. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
NMFS is considering requiring bottom trawlers operating in offshore waters south of Cape May, NJ, to use TEDs, and
is collecting information regarding when and where bottom trawlers interact with sea turtles. NMFS requests comments
on bottom trawl gear and fisheries that may capture sea turtles.

2. Mandatory Observer Coverage 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Under the current regulations (50 CFR 227.72), NMFS must propose a temporary rule in order to require mandatory observer
coverage in any non-shrimp fishery that may take sea turtles. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Non-shrimp fisheries using longlines, bottom trawls, gillnets, pound nets and traps are suspected to be major causes
of sea turtle mortality at sea. The NAS recommended that NMFS conduct a comprehensive observer-based assessment
of incidental capture of sea turtles in non-shrimp fisheries. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
NMFS is considering establishing a mandatory observer requirement in those fisheries that are not already required
to carry observers upon NMFS request. The observer system would require NMFS to publish a finding that a specific fishery
is believed to be taking sea turtles. This finding would notify the fishery that the Regional Director may require
observers at any time, and will notify vessel owners by personal communication. An observer requirement might also
include a registration requirement, observer access requirement and observer treatment standards. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
3. Emergency Response Framework 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Under the current regulations (50 CFR 227.72), NMFS cannot take timely action during emergencies that result in mass
turtle strandings. Unpredictable situations, despite compliance with current regulations, may require immediate
sea turtle conservation measures that cannot wait for lengthy agency and public review. Emergency rulemaking can
take 2 weeks to 2 months to implement, depending on the required measures and complexity of the rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
NMFS is considering the establishment of framework measures to respond to specific sea turtle emergencies. For example,
if NMFS determines that high concentrations of small juvenile turtles that are not excluded by standard TEDs are occurring
with fishing activity, it may notify the fishery (through the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 and various media) of immediate conservation measures such as gear modification, observers, or area closures. Because
the industry will have been notified in advance through rulemaking that specific emergency measures may be required
for specific purposes, delayed effectiveness and prior notice would not be required. Emergency conservation measures
could be in effect for up to 30 days.

If the Committee approves the proposed additions, all entities of the Federal Government (except as otherwise indicated)
will be required to procure the commodity and services listed below from nonprofit agencies employing persons who
are blind or have other severe disabilities.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
I certify that the following action will not have a significant impact on a substantial number of small entities. The
major factors considered for this certification were:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. The action will not result in any additional reporting, recordkeeping or other compliance requirements for small
entities other than the small organizations that will furnish the commodity and services to the Government.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. The action does not appear to have a severe economic impact on current contractors for the commodity and services.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. The action will result in authorizing small entities to furnish the commodity and services to the Government.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. There are no known regulatory alternatives which would accomplish the objectives of the Javits-Wagner-O'Day
Act (41 U.S.C. 46&hyph;48c) in connection with the commodity and services proposed for addition to the Procurement
List.

SUMMARY: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
This notice revises the schedules of income eligibility levels for participation in the Foster Grandparent Program
(FGP) and Senior Companion Program (SCP), published in 58 FR 13735, March 15, 1993 and 58 FR 40405, July 28, 1993
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The revised schedules are based on changes in program regulations published in 59 FR 15120, March 31, 1994 and in the
Poverty Guidelines from the Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS), published in 59 FR 6277, February 10,
1994. The change in regulations eliminates the SSI (Supplemental Security Income) adjustment to income eligibility
used in prior years. No volunteer currently participating in these programs shall become ineligible as a result of
this change in guidelines.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In accordance with the revised program regulations, the income eligibility level for each State is 125 percent of
the DHHS Poverty Guidelines, except in those areas determined by the Corporation to be of higher cost of living in which
case the guideline shall be 135 percent of the DHHS Poverty Guidelines.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The level of eligibility is rounded to the next highest multiple of $5.00.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For purposes of determining eligibility, an amount not to exceed 15 percent of the applicable FGP/SCP income guideline
is deductible from gross income for out-of-pocket medical expenses of the applicant, enrollee, or spouse.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Any person whose income is not more than 100 percent of the DHHS Poverty Guideline for her/his specific family unit
shall be given special consideration for participation in the Foster Grandparent and Senior Companion Programs.

SUMMARY: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
The Baltimore District of U.S. Army Corps of Engineers investigated the feasibility of construction of fish and wildlife
restoration measures in the Anacostia River basin. The District Engineer recommends the restoration of 80 acres
of wetlands, t miles of streams and 33 acres of bottomland habitat. The feasibility study of the potential restoration
actions was conducted under authority of a U.S. House of Representatives Committee on Public Works and Transportation
resolution adopted September 8, 1988. The non-Federal sponsors for the feasibility phase of the project are: Montgomery
County, Prince Georges County, the District of Columbia, the State of Maryland, the Interstate Commission on the
Potomac River Basin, and the Metropolitan Washington Counsel of Governments.

1. The U.S. House of Representatives, Committee on Public Works and Transportation, authorized the Anacostia River
and Tributaries study in a resolution adopted on September 8, 1988. The resolution requested the Corps of Engineers
to determine if further improvements for flood control, navigation, erosion, sedimentation, water quality and
other related water resources needs are advisable on the Anacostia River and Tributaries.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. The Anacostia River basin is a 170-square-mile sub-basin of the Potomac River. Headwaters of the Anacostia River
are in the Piedmont and coastal plain areas of Montgomery and Prince Georges Counties, Maryland and it joins with the
Potomac River in the District of Columbia. The entire river system is freshwater; although, the total tidal influence
extends for approximately 9 miles above the confluence with the Potomac River.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. The Corps of Engineers involvement in the basin dates back more than 115 years and includes projects and programs
for navigation, flood control, debris removal and aquatic vegatation control. These Federal actions have served
their intended purposes well and have benefited the area in terms of improved navigation and reduced flood damage.
However, from 1902 through the 1960s, project construction eliminated approximately 2,600 acres of wetlands, 99,000
linear feet of aquatic habitat and 700 acres of bottomland hardwoods. These ecosystems performed numerous beneficial
ecological functions for the Anacostia basin and the associated Potomac River and Chesapeake Bay. One of the primary
functions of these ecosystems is fish and wildlife habitat. Historically, the Anacostia River basin contained a
diverse assemblage of fish and wildlife species. However, populations of many species have sharply declined due
to the habitat loss and degradation in the Anacostia basin.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Take notice that on April 26, 1994, Northwest Pipeline Corporation (Northwest), 295 Chipeta Way, Salt Lake City,
Utah 84158, filed in Docket No. CP94&hyph;379&hyph;000 a request pursuant to &sect;157.205 of the Commission's
Regulations to partially abandon existing facilities and to construct and operate replacement facilities at the
Genesee Meter Station in Whitman County, Washington to maintain the ability to accommodate its existing firm maximum
daily delivery obligations (MDDO) to The Washington Water Power Company (Water Power), a local distribution company,
under Northwest's blanket certificate issued in Docket No. CP82&hyph;433&hyph;000, pursuant to Section 7 of the
Natural Gas Act, all as more fully set forth in the request on file with the Commission and open to public inspection.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Northwest proposes to replace a two-inch positive displacement meter at the Genesee Meter Station in Whitman County,
Washington with a two-inch Roots meter which will decrease the maximum design delivery capacity of the station from
350 dth per day to approximately 185 dth per day at 150 psig. Northwest states that the smaller design capacity would
be adequate to deliver the current MDDO of 128 dth per day at this point. Northwest states that the estimated cost of
replacing the facilities at the Genesee Meter Station is $30,440, including the $2,622 cost of removing the retired
facilities. Northwest indicates that since it initiated this project to replace obsolete equipment, Northwest
would not require any cost reimbursement from Water Power.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Further, Northwest states that no significant impact on Northwest's peak day or annual deliveries is projected from
the proposed facility replacement. Northwest's tariff does not prohibit the modification of delivery point facilities
and any volumes delivered to the Genesee delivery point would be within the authorized entitlements of any shipper.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Any person or the Commission's staff may, within 45 days after issuance of the instant notice by the Commission, file
pursuant to rule 214 of the Commission's Procedural Rules (18 CFR 385.214) a motion to intervene or notice of intervention
and pursuant to &sect;157.205 of the Regulations under the Natural Gas Act (18 CFR 157.205) a protest to the request.
If not protest is filed within the time allowed therefor, the proposed activity shall be deemed to be authorized effective
the day after the time allowed for filing a protest. If a protest is filed and not withdrawn within 30 days after the time
allowed for filing a protest, the instant request shall be treated as an application for authorization pursuant to
section 7 of the Natural Gas Act.

Take notice that on April 21, 1994, Panhandle Eastern Pipe Line Company (Panhandle) as required by Ordering Paragraphs
(C) and (D) of the Commission's Order on Remand issued on March 22, 1994 filed its refund report. 66 FERC &para;61,329
(1994).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Panhandle states that it is refunding to Western Resources, Inc. (formerly Kansas Power &amp; Light Co.) (Western)
amounts collected for Rate Schedule T&hyph;53 forward haul and backhaul services rendered during the period March
1, 1988, to March 31, 1989, that exceeded the pre-existing rates.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Accordingly, this report reflects the calculation of refulds to be paid to Western, under the Commission's Order
on Remand, as well as the recalculation of the Docket No. RP87&hyph;103&hyph;000 refund amounts to other customers
and the determination of the amounts to be billed to Panhandle's customers as a result of the Commission Order on Remand
and as permitted by the Settlement filed March 22, 1990, in this docket.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
BankAmerica Corporation, San Francisco, California (Applicant), has applied pursuant to section 4(c)(8) of the
Bank Holding Company Act (12 U.S.C. 1843(c)(8)) (BHC Act) and  225.23(a)(3) of the Board's Regulation Y (12 CFR 225.23(a)(3))
to engage

 through BA Futures, Inc., Chicago, Illinois (Company), a futures commission merchant registered under the Commodity
Exchange Act (7 U.S.C.  1

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->

), in executing and clearing, and clearing without executing the following contracts on the following exchanges:
Light Sweet Crude Oil Futures, Options on Light Sweet Crude Oil Futures, No. 2 Heating Oil Futures and Options on No.
2 Heating Oil Futures on the New York Mercantile Exchange; Corn Futures, Options on Corn Futures, Wheat Futures, Options
on Wheat Futures, Soybean Futures and Options on Soybean Futures on the Chicago Board of Trade; and Live Cattle Futures,
Options on Live Cattle Futures, Feeder Cattle Futures, Options on Feeder Cattle Futures, Live Hog Futures and Options
on Live Hog Futures on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange. Applicant proposes to conduct these activities throughout
the world.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 4(c)(8) of the BHC Act provides that a bank holding company may, with Board approval, engage in any activity
which the Board, after due notice and opportunity for hearing, has determined (by order or regulation) to be so closely
related to banking or managing or controlling banks as to be a proper incident thereto. This statutory test requires
that two separate tests be met for an activity to be permissible for a bank holding company. First, the Board must determine
that the activity is, as a general matter, closely related to banking. Second, the Board must find in a particular case
that the performance of the activity by the applicant bank holding company may reasonably be expected to produce public
benefits that outweigh possible adverse effects.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A particular activity may be found to meet the closely related to banking test if it is demonstrated that banks have
generally provided the proposed activity, that banks generally provide services that are operationally or functionally
similar to the proposed activity so as to equip them particularly well to provide the proposed activity, or that banks
generally provide services that are so integrally related to the proposed activity as to require their provision
in a specialized form.

the activity has a reasonable or close relationship to banking or managing or controlling banks. Board Statement
Regarding Regulation Y, 49 FR 806, January 5, (1984).

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
J.P. Morgan
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 the Board conditioned approval of the application on J.P. Morgan's commitment that it would not perform execution,
clearance or investment advisory services for commodity funds (or commodity pools) owned, sponsored by, or otherwise
affiliated with, J.P. Morgan. In contrast, Applicant proposes that Company's customers would include a managed
commodity fund formed outside of the United States, sponsored by an affiliate of Applicant.

of the proposal is published solely to seek the views of interested persons on the issues presented by the application
and does not represent a determination by the Board that the proposal meets, or is likely to meet, the standards of the
BHC Act.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Any comments or requests for hearing should be submitted in writing and received by William W. Wiles, Secretary, Board
of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, Washington, D.C. 20551, not later than May 23, 1994. Any request for a hearing

The company listed in this notice has filed an application under  225.23(a)(1) of the Board's Regulation Y (12 CFR 225.23(a)(1))
for the Board's approval under section 4(c)(8) of the Bank Holding Company Act (12 U.S.C. 1843(c)(8)) and  225.21(a)
of Regulation Y (12 CFR 225.21(a)) to commence or to engage

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, either directly or through a subsidiary, in a nonbanking activity that is listed in  225.25 of Regulation Y as closely
related to banking and permissible for bank holding companies. Unless otherwise noted, such activities will be conducted

The application is available for immediate inspection at the Federal Reserve Bank indicated. Once the application
has been accepted for processing, it will also be available for inspection at the offices of the Board of Governors.
Interested persons may express their views in writing on the question whether consummation of the proposal can ``reasonably
be expected to produce benefits to the public, such as greater convenience, increased competition, or gains in efficiency,
that outweigh possible adverse effects, such as undue concentration of resources, decreased or unfair competition,
conflicts of interests, or unsound banking practices.'' Any request for a hearing on this question must be accompanied
by a statement of the reasons a written presentation would not suffice in lieu of a hearing, identifying specifically
any questions of fact that are in dispute, summarizing the evidence that would be presented at a hearing, and indicating
how the party commenting would be aggrieved by approval of the proposal.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Comments regarding the application must be received at the Reserve Bank indicated or the offices of the Board of Governors
not later than May 26, 1994.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Federal Trade Commission having initiated an investigation of certain acts and practices of AJM Packaging Corporation,
a corporation, and Abram Epstein, individually and as officer of said corporation (``proposed respondents''),
and it now appearing that proposed respondents are willing to enter into an agreement containing an order to cease
and desist from the acts and practices being investigated,
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
It is hereby agreed
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 by and between AJM Packaging Corporation, and Abram Epstein, by their duly authorized officer and their attorney,
and counsel for the Federal Trade Commission that:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. Proposed respondent AJM Packaging Corporation is a Michigan corporation with its office and principal place of
business at 6910 Dix Avenue, Detroit, Michigan 48209.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Proposed respondent Abram Epstein is the president of said corporation. In his capacity as president, he formulates,
directs, and controls the acts and practices of said corporation, and his business address is the same as that of said
corporation.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. Proposed respondents admit all the jurisdictional facts set forth in the attached draft complaint.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. Proposed respondents waive:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(a) Any further procedural steps;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) The requirement that the Commission's decision contain a statement of findings of fact and conclusions of law;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) All rights to seek judicial review or otherwise to challenge or contest the validity of the order entered pursuant
to this agreement; and
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(d) All claims under the Equal Access to Justice Act.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. This agreement shall not become a part of the public record of the proceeding unless and until it is accepted by the
Commission. If this agreement is accepted by the Commission, it, together with the attached draft complaint, will
be placed on the public record for a period of sixty (60) days and information in respect thereto publicly released.
The Commission thereafter may either withdraw its acceptance of this agreement and so notify the proposed respondents,
in which event it will take such action as it may consider appropriate, or issue and serve its complaint (in such form
as the circumstances may require) and decision, in disposition of the proceeding.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
5. This agreement is for settlement purposes only and does not constitute an admission by proposed respondents that
the law has been violated as alleged in the attached draft complaint, or that the facts as alleged in the attached draft
complaint, other than the jurisdictional facts, are true.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
6. This agreement contemplates that, if it is accepted by the Commission, and if such acceptance is not subsequently
withdrawn by the Commission pursuant to the provisions of &sect;2.34 of the Commission's Rules, the Commission may
without further notice to proposed respondents, (1) issue its complaint corresponding in form and substance with
the attached draft complaint and its decision containing the following order to cease and desist in disposition of
the proceeding, and (2) make information public in respect thereto. When so entered, the order to cease and desist
shall have the same force and effect and may be altered, modified, or set aside in the same manner and within the same
time provided by statute for other orders. The order shall become final upon service. Delivery by the U.S. Postal Service
of the decision containing the agreed-to order to proposed respondents' address as stated in this agreement shall
constitute service. Proposed respondents waive any right they might have to any other manner of service. The complaint
may be used in construing the terms of the order, and no agreement, understanding, representation, or interpretation
not contained in the order or in the agreement may be used to vary or contradict the terms of the order.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
7. Proposed respondents have read the complaint and the order contemplated hereby. They understand that once the
order has been issued, they will be required to file one or more compliance reports showing that they have fully complied
with the order. Proposed respondents further understand that they may be liable for civil penalties in the amount
provided by law for each violation of the order after it becomes final.

Analysis of Consent Order To Aid Public Comment
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Federal Trade Commission has accepted an agreement, subject to final approval, to a proposed consent order from
respondents AJM Packaging Corporation, a Michigan corporation, and Abram Epstein, an officer of said corporation.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed consent order has been placed on the public record for sixty (60) days for reception of comments by interested
persons. Comments received during this period will become part of the public record. After sixty (60) days, the Commission
will again review the agreement and the comments received and will decide whether it should withdraw from the agreement
and take other appropriate action, or make final the agreement's proposed order.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This matter concerns the package labeling of ``Nature's Own Green Label'' disposable paper plates. The Commission's
complaint in this matter charges that respondents' labeling falsely represented that ``Nature's Own Green Label''
disposable paper plates are recyclable after ordinary use. In fact, the complaint alleges, while ``Nature's Own
Green Label'' disposable paper plates are capable of being recycled, the vast majority of consumers cannot recycle
the product because there are virtually no collection facilities that accept used paper plates for recycling. The
complaint further charges that the respondents' labeling contained unsubstantiated representations concerning
the plates' alleged degradability and the environmental benefits that could be obtained when the bags were disposed
of as trash that is subsequently buried in a sanitary landfill (customary disposal). The complaint alleges that the
respondents represented that ``Nature's Own Green Label'' disposable paper plates offer a significant environmental
benefit when consumers customarily disposed of them, and that ``Nature's Own Green Label'' disposable paper plates
will completely break down, decompose and return to nature_

The proposed consent order contains provisions designed to remedy the violations charged and to prevent the respondents
from engaging in similar acts and practices in the future.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Part I of the proposed order requires that the respondents cease representing, in any manner, directly or by implication,
that any of their paper products or packages are ``degradable,'' ``biodegradable,'' or ``photodegradable,'' or
through the use of such terms or similar terms, that any such product or package offers any environmental benefits
when consumers dispose of them as trash that is buried in a sanitary landfill, unless the respondents have competent
and reliable scientific evidence to substantiate the representations at the time they are made.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Part II of the proposed order requires that the respondents cease misrepresenting, in any manner, directly or by implication,
the extent to which any paper product or package is capable of being recycled or the extent to which recycling collection
programs are available.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Part III of the proposed order requires the respondents to cease representing that their products or packages offer
any environmental benefit, unless at the time of making such a representation, the respondents possess and rely upon
competent and reliable evidence, which when appropriate must be competent and reliable scientific evidence, that
substantiates such representations.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Part IV of the proposed order permitted the respondents to deplete their existing inventory of certain paper plate
product packaging in the normal course of business without violating the order until October 31, 1993.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed order also requires the respondents to maintain materials relied upon to substantiate the claims covered
by the order, to distribute copies of the order to certain company officials, to notify the Commission of any changes
in corporate structure that might affect compliance with the order, to notify the Commission of any changes in the
business or employment of the named individual respondent, and to file one or more reports detailing compliance with
the order.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The purpose of this analysis is to facilitate public comment on the proposed order. It is not intended to constitute
an official interpretation of the agreement and proposed order or to modify in any way their terms.

Analysis of Consent Order To Aid Public Comment
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Federal Trade Commission has accepted an agreement, subject to final approval, to a proposed consent order from
respondents LePage's, Inc., a Pennsylvania corporation, and LP Holdings, Inc., a Delaware corporation.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed consent order has been placed on the public record for sixty (60) days for reception of comments by interested
persons. Comments received during this period will become part of the public record. After sixty (60) days, the Commission
will again review the agreement and the comments received and will decide whether it should withdraw from the agreement
and take other appropriate action, or make final the agreement's proposed order.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This matter concerns the labeling and advertising of LePage's Biodegradable Transparent Tape. The Commission's
complaint in this matter alleges that LePage's Biodegradable Transparent Tape is a cellophane tape made from wood
pulp and adhesive material; that the retail tape product is sold with a hard clear non-foam polystyrene plastic dispenser
that does not identify the type(s) of plastic resin from which it is made; and that the tape and dispenser are attached
to a non-corrugated paperboard or cardboard backcard. The complaint charges that the respondents represented without
substantiation that LePage's Biodegradable Transparent Tape will completely break down and return to nature_
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
i.e.,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 decompose into elements found in nature_within a reasonably short period of time after customary disposal and that
compared to other transparent tape, LePage's Biodegradable Transparent Tape offers a significant environmental
benefit after customary disposal. The complaint further charges that the respondents falsely represented that
the plastic tape dispenser and paperboard backcard of LePage's Biodegradable Transparent Tape are recyclable.
In fact, the complaint alleges, the plastic tape dispenser and the paperboard package are not recyclable, because
there are only a few collection facilities nationwide that will accept the non-foam polystyrene tape dispenser or
the non-corrugated paperboard or cardboard backcard for recycling.

The proposed consent order contains provisions designed to remedy the violations charged and to prevent the respondents
from engaging in similar acts and practices in the future.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Part I of the proposed order requires that the respondents cease and desist from representing, in any manner, directly
or by implication, that any of their products or packages are degradable, biodegradable, or photodegradable, or
more specifically through the use of such terms or similar terms that any such product or package offers any environmental
benefits when consumers dispose of it as trash that is buried in a sanitary landfill, unless at the time of making such
representation, the respondents possess and rely upon competent and reliable scientific evidence that substantiates
such representation.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Part II of the proposed order requires that the respondents cease and desist from misrepresenting, in any manner,
directly or by implication, with respect to any product or package the extent to which it is capable of being recycled
or to which recycling collection programs are available. Part II also contains a provision that allows the respondents
to advertise non-foam polystyrene and non-corrugated paperboard and cardboard products or packages as recyclable
without violating Part II of the order. The respondents may do so if they truthfully represent that such products or
packages are capable of being recycled; disclose clearly, prominently and in close proximity to such claim (a) that
such product or package is recyclable in the few communities with recycling collection programs for non-foam polystyrene
or for non-corrugated paperboard or cardborad; or (b) the approximate number of U.S. communities with recycling
collection programs for such product or package; or (c) the approximate percentage of U.S. population to which recycling
collection programs for such product or package are available; and in addition, in the case of any non-foam polystyrene
product or package, such product or package itself bears a clear identification of the specific plastic resin(s)
from which it is made.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Part III of the proposed order provides that if the respondents represent in advertising or labeling that any product
or package offers any environmental benefit, they must have a reasonable basis consisting of competent and reliable
evidence, which when appropriate must be competent and reliable scientific evidence, that substantiates the claims.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed order also requires the respondents to maintain materials relied upon to substantiate the claims covered
by the order, to distribute copies of the order to certain company officials, to notify the Commission of any changes
in corporate structure that might affect compliance with the order, and to file one or more reports detailing compliance
with the order.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The purpose of this analysis is to facilitate public comment on the proposed order. It is not intended to constitute
an official interpretation of the agreement and proposed order or to modify in any way their terms.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
Analysis of Proposed Consent Order To Aid Public Comment
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Federal Trade Commission has accepted an agreement, subject to final approval, to a proposed consent order from
respondents Mia Rose Products, Inc., a California corporation, and Mia Rose Palencar, individually and as an officer
of the corporation.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed consent order has been placed on the public record for sixty (60) days for reception of comments by interested
persons. Comments received during this period will become part of the public record. After sixty (60) days, the Commission
will again review the agreement and the comments received and will decide whether it should withdraw from the agreement
and take other appropriate action or make final the agreement's proposed order.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This matter concerns two products, named ``Air Therapy'' and ``Pet Air,'' sold by Mia Rose Products, Inc. (``the company'').
Air Therapy and Pet Air are air sprays made from the essential oils of citrus fruit and/or herbs. These two products
have identical ingredients, and are both sold for their alleged air freshening, air cleaning and insecticidal effects.
The Commission's complaint charges that respondents' advertising contained false and unsubstantiated representations
that these products are effective in eliminating indoor air pollutants and household insects. Specifically, the
complaint alleges that respondents falsely represented that: (1) These products are effective in cleaning or purifying
indoor air; (2) these products are more effective in cleaning or purifying indoor air than conventional air cleaning
products; (3) spraying these products into the air eliminates smoke; (4) spraying these products into the air eliminates
pollen; (5) spraying these products into the air eliminates airborne bacteria; (6) spraying Pet Air into the air eliminates
pet dander; (7) spraying Air Therapy into the air eliminates household insects; and (8) spraying these products into
the air eliminates, rather than masks, odors.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed consent order contains provisions designed to remedy the violations charged and to prevent the respondents
from engaging in similar acts and practices in the future. Part I of the proposed order would prohibit the company from
making any of the false claims delineated above for Air Therapy, Pet Air, or any products with substantially similar
ingredients.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Part II of the proposed order includes broad fencing-in relief, requiring the respondents to cease and desist from
representing the efficacy or performance of any air cleaning, air freshening, or insecticidal product unless such
representation is true, and at the time of making such representation, Mia Rose possesses and relies upon competent
and reliable evidence, which when appropriate must be competent and reliable scientific evidence.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Part IV of the proposed order is a provision that allows the company a period of four months from the date the proposed
order becomes final before it is obligated to re-word its labeling on its current inventory of Air Therapy and Pet Air
cans. All other provisions of the order become effective immediately upon the Commission's issuance of the order
as final.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed order also requires the respondents to maintain materials relied upon to substantiate claims covered
by the order; to provide a copy of the consent agreement to all employees or representatives involved in the preparation
and placement of the company's advertisements, or in communication with the company's customers or prospective
customers; to notify the Commission of any changes in corporate structure that might affect compliance with the order;
to notify the Commission of certain changes in the business or employment of the named individual respondent; and
to file one or more reports detailing compliance with the order.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The purpose of this analysis is to facilitate public comment on the proposed order. It is not intended to constitute
an official interpretation of the agreement and proposed order or to modify in any way their terms.

Analysis of Consent Order To Aid Public Comment
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Federal Trade Commission has accepted an agreement, subject to final approval, to a proposed consent order from
respondents Oak Hill Industries Corp., a New York corporation, and Malcolm Foster, individually and as an officer
of the corporate respondent.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed consent order has been placed on the public record for sixty (60) days for reception of comments by interested
persons. Comments received during this period will become part of the public record. After sixty (60) days, the Commission
will again review the agreement and the comments received and will decide whether it should withdraw from the agreement
and take other appropriate action, or make final the agreement's proposed order.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This matter concerns the labeling and advertising of Oak Hill brand plastic plates, bowls and utensils. The Commission's
complaint in this matter alleges that Oak Hill brand plastic plates, bowls and utensils are made from non-foam polystyrene;
that they are packaged in thin plastic packaging which is sometimes made from polypropylene film and at other times
from low-density polyethylene film; and that such plastic products and packaging do not identify the type(s) of plastic
resin from which they are made. The complaint charges that Oak Hill falsely represented that the plastic plates, bowls
and utensils and the plastic film packaging are recyclable. In fact, the complaint alleges, the plastic products
and packaging are not recyclable, because there are only a few collection facilities nationwide that will accept
non-foam polystyrene plates, bowls or utensils or the polypropylene film or low-density polyethylene film plastic
packaging for recycling.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed consent order contains provisions designed to remedy the violations charged and to prevent the respondents
from engaging in similar acts and practices in the future.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Part I of the proposed order requires that respondents cease and desist from misrepresenting, in any manner, directly
or by implication, with respect to any product or package the extent to which it is capable of being recycled or to which
recycling collection programs are available. Part I also contains a proviso that allows the respondents to advertise
non-foam polystyrene, polypropylene film or low-density polyethylene film products or packages as recyclable
without violating Part I of the order. The respondents may do so if they truthfully represent that such products or
packages are capable of being recycled; disclose clearly, prominently and in close proximity to such claim: (a) That
such product or package is recyclable in the few communities with recycling collection programs for non-foam polystyrene,
polypropylene film or low-density polyethylene film; or (b) the approximate number of U.S. communities with recycling
collection programs for such product or package; or (c) the approximate percentage U.S. communities or the U.S. population
to which recycling collection programs for such product or package are available; and in addition, such product or
package itself bears a clear identification of the specific plastic resin(s) from which it is made.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Part II of the proposed order provides that if the respondents represent in advertising or labeling that any product
or package offers any environmental benefit, they must have a reasonable basis consisting of competent and reliable
evidence, which when appropriate must be competent and reliable scientific evidence, that substantiates the claims.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed order also requires respondents to maintain materials relied upon to substantiate the claims covered
by the order, to distribute copies of the order to certain company officials, to notify the Commission of any changes
in corporate structure that might affect compliance with the order, and to file one or more reports detailing compliance
with the order.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The purpose of this analysis is to facilitate public comment on the proposed order. It is not intended to constitute
an official interpretation of the agreement and proposed order or to modify in any way their terms.

In settlement of alleged violations of federal law prohibiting unfair acts and practices and unfair methods of competition,
this consent order prohibits, among other things, the Oregon-based respondents, who marketed potholders and mohair
for use as doll's hair, from making any material misrepresentations regarding earnings or profits of participants
in any work opportunity and from making misrepresentations about the marketplace demand for any product or service
for which the respondents are offering a work opportunity. In addition, the order sets a $536,000 redress payment,
however, based upon financial statements submitted by the respondents, the order suspends all redress payments,
except for a $25,000 payment by the individual respondents in this matter.

 The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is making available a document that sets forth the agency's strategy for implementing
the provisions of the Safe Medical Devices Act of 1990 (the SMDA) which require FDA to review the classification of
certain class III (premarket approval) devices, and either reclassify the devices into class I (general controls)
or class II (special controls) or retain them in class III. The statute also requires FDA to establish a schedule for
requiring the submission of premarket approval applications (PMA's) for those devices retained in class III.

 Section 513 of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the act) (21 U.S.C. 360c) requires the classification of medical
devices into one of three regulatory classes: Class I (general controls), class II (special controls), and class
III (premarket approval). Generally, devices that were on the market before May 28, 1976, the date of enactment of
the Medical Device Amendments of 1976 (the amendments) (Pub. L. 94&hyph;295), and devices marketed on or after that
date that are substantially equivalent to such devices, have been classified by FDA. This notice refers to both the
devices that were on the market before May 28, 1976, and the substantially equivalent devices that were marketed on
or after that date, as ``preamendments devices.''
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Section 515(b)(1) of the act (21 U.S.C. 360e(b)(1)) establishes the requirement that a preamendments device that
FDA has classified into class III is subject to premarket approval. However, submission of a PMA, or a notice of completion
of a product development protocol (PDP), is not required until 90 days after FDA promulgates a final rule requiring
premarket approval for the device, or 30 months after final classification of the device, whichever is later. Similarly,
a preamendments device is not required to have an approved investigational device exemption (IDE) (21 CFR part 812)
contemporaneous with its interstate distribution until the date identified by FDA in the final rule requiring submission
of a PMA for the device. To date, FDA has issued eight final rules requiring submission of PMA's for preamendments class
III devices. Nine additional proposed rules have been issued.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 The SMDA (Pub. L. 101&hyph;629) added new section 515(i) to the act (21 U.S.C. 360e(i)). This section requires FDA
to order manufacturers of class III preamendments devices for which no final rule has been issued requiring the submission
of PMA's to submit to FDA a summary of, and citation to, any information known or otherwise available to the manufacturer
respecting such devices, including adverse safety and effectiveness information that has not been submitted under
section 519 of the act (21 U.S.C. 360i). Section 515(i) of the act further directs FDA to publish a regulation before
December 1, 1995, for each device subject to section 515(i) either revising the classification of the device into
class I or class II or retaining the device in class III. Within 12 months after publication of a regulation retaining
a device in class III, the statute requires FDA to establish a schedule for the promulgation of a rule requiring the
submission of PMA's for the device. However, the SMDA does not prevent FDA from proceeding immediately to rulemaking
under section 515(b) of the act on specific devices, in the interest of public health, independent of the procedure
in section 515(i) of the act.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 Since enactment of the SMDA, FDA has issued proposed rules to require the submission of PMA's for five devices: Silicone
inflatable saline filled breast prostheses; penile implants; testicular implants; nonroller cardiovascular
blood pumps; and cranial electrotherapy stimulators. FDA is now announcing the availability of a document outlining
its plans for either revising the classification, or requiring the submission of PMA's for the remaining preamendments
class III devices.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
FDA has divided this universe of devices into three groups:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 1. Group 3 devices are devices that FDA believes are currently in commercial distribution and are not likely candidates
for reclassification. FDA will require the submission of PMA's for these devices in the near future. FDA intends to
issue proposed rules to require the submission of PMA's for the 15 highest priority devices in this group in phases
over the next 3 years. In accordance with the procedures in section 515(b) of the act, manufacturers will have an opportunity
to petition for reclassification of these devices by submitting a reclassification petition within 15 days of publication
of the proposed rule to require submission of PMA's. Manufacturers who wish to petition for reclassification should
begin preparing petitions for reclassification as soon as possible. FDA will initiate the 515(i) process for the
remaining Group 3 devices. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 2. Group 2 devices are devices that FDA believes have a high potential for being reclassified into class II. For these
devices, FDA intends to issue an order under section 515(i) of the act requiring
<!-- PJG 0101 clearpage -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
manufacturers to submit a summary of, and citation to, any information respecting these devices. A manufacturer
who wishes to have one of these devices reclassified will be required to submit information to support reclassification
of the device.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 3. Group 1 devices are devices that FDA believes raise significant questions of safety and/or effectiveness but are
no longer used or are very limited in use. FDA believes that, for these devices, rulemaking under section 515(b) of
the act will not result in viable PMA's or reclassification petitions. FDA intends to initiate a rulemaking proceeding
to require the submission of PMA's for this group of devices. FDA will review any information received in response
to the proposed rule to determine whether to issue a final rule requiring the submission of PMA's.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 The strategy document lists the devices by categories in each of these groups. It also describes in more detail FDA's
plans for implementing these procedures.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 FDA believes that the procedures set forth in this strategy document are consistent with the congressional intent
in enacting section 515(i) of the act. The Senate report makes clear the need to require submission of PMA's as soon
as possible for those devices that are to remain in class III. (See S. Rept. 513, 101st Cong., 2d sess. 18 (1990)). Furthermore,
the House of Representatives Report of the Safe Medical Devices Act of 1990 stated:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
In formulating these schedules [for requiring the submission of a PMA], the FDA should take into account its priorities
and limited resources, together with the Committee's intention that the evaluation process be expeditious. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
(See H. Rept. 808, 101st Cong., 2d sess. 26 (1990)). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Interested persons may, on or before July 9, 1994, submit to the Dockets Management Branch (address above) written
comments regarding this strategy document. Two copies of any comments are to be submitted, except that individuals
may submit one copy. Comments are to be identified with the docket number found in brackets in the heading of this document.

. The device is a temporary external pulse generator and is indicated for use in any clinical situation in which the
use of a temporary pacemaker on a patient provides therapeutic or diagnostic value or serves a prophylactic purpose.
Indications for the use of temporary cardiac pacemakers include, but are not limited to, the following: Intermittent
or complete heart block associated with asystole or bradycardia, symptomatic sinus bradycardia, surgically induced
heart block, and heart block accompanying an acute myocardial infarction.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Additionally, temporary cardiac pacing has been used to overdrive, and thereby terminate, atrial arrhythmias,
including atrial flutter. It has been used in preparation for permanent pacemaker implantation to ascertain the
thresholds for sensing and pacing on the acute lead system. Although the intended uses of the Model 4553 MICRO&hyph;PACE

 On February 28, 1992, United Contact Lens, Inc., Lynnwood, WA 98036, submitted to CDRH an application for premarket
approval of the UCL&hyph;55 and UCL&hyph;55 TORIC (ocufilcon C) Soft (hydrophilic) Contact Lenses. The UCL&hyph;55
and UCL&hyph;55 TORIC (ocufilcon C) Soft (hydrophilic) Contact Lenses are indicated for daily wear for the correction
of visual acuity in not-aphakic persons with nondiseased eyes that are myopic (near-sighted) and hyperopic (farsighted).
The spherical lens may be worn by persons who may exhibit astigmatism of 1.25 diopters (D) or less that does not interfere
with visual acuity. The toric lens is indicated for the correction of astigmatism of 7.00 D or less. In addition, the
lens is to be disinfected using a chemical lens care system. The application includes authorization from N &amp; N
Contact Lens International, Inc., Lynwood, WA 98046, to incorporate information contained in the approved PMA and
related supplements for the SOFTOUCH and SOFTOUCH TORIC (ocufilcon C) Soft (hydrophilic) Contact Lenses. In accordance
with the provisions of section 515(c)(2) of the act as amended by the Safe Medical Devices Act of 1990, this PMA was not
referred to the Ophthalmic Devices Panel, and FDA advisory panel, for review and recommendation because the information
in the PMA substantially duplicates information previously reviewed by this panel. On March 7, 1994, CDRH approved
the application by a letter to the applicant from the Acting Director of the Office of Device Evaluation, CDRH.

a Draft Environmental Impact Statement (DEIS) and conduct scoping meetings in this proceeding. The Elk River Railroad,
Inc. (TERRI) filed a petition for exemption seeking authority to construct and operate a 30-mile line of railroad
from Hartland to Falling Rock, in Clay and Kanawha Counties, WV. Because of the proposed construction and operation's
potential for significant environmental impacts, SEA has determined that preparation of a DEIS is necessary. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The DEIS will address the environmental impacts associated with this proposed construction and operation and will
be served on all the parties to the proceeding and made available to the public. There will be a 45 day comment period
from the date the DEIS is served to allow the public opportunity to comment. After assessing all of the comments to the
DEIS, SEA will then issue a Final Environmental Impact Statement (FEIS) that will include SEA's final recommendations
to the Commission. The Commission will consider the FEIS and the environmental record in making its decision. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The purpose of the scoping process is to identify significant environmental issues and determine the scope of issues
to be addressed in the DEIS. Issues typically addressed in DEIS's include alternatives to the proposed action, impacts
on transportation systems, land use, socio-economic impacts directly related to changes in the physical environment,
energy resources, air quality, noise quality, public health and safety, biological resources, water quality, historic
resources, coastal zone management consistency review, and mitigation to reduce or avoid impacts on the environment.
Persons that cannot attend the scoping meetings may submit questions and comments in writing up to 30 days after the
scoping meetings. Written comments may be submitted directly to the Commission no later than July 1, 1994. Public
scoping meetings will be held on the following dates: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;May 31, 1994, from 3 p.m. to 7 p.m at the Clendenin Community Center (next to the Town Hall) and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;June 1, 1994, from 4 p.m. to 7:30 p.m. at the Clay High School Cafeteria.

Minimum Wages for Federal and Federally Assisted Construction; General Wage Determination Decisions
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
General wage determination decisions of the Secretary of Labor are issued in accordance with applicable law and are
based on the information obtained by the Department of Labor from its study of local wage conditions and data made available
from other sources. They specify the basic hourly wage rates and fringe benefits which are determined to be prevailing
for the described classes of laborers and mechanics employed on construction projects of a similar character and
in the localities specified therein.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The determinations in these decisions of prevailing rates and fringe benefits have been made in accordance with 29
CFR part 1, by authority of the Secretary of Labor pursuant to the provisions of the Davis-Bacon Act of March 3, 1931,
as amended (46 Stat. 1494, as amended, 40 U.S.C. 276a) and of other Federal statutes referred to in 29 CFR part 1, appendix,
as well as such additional statutes as may from time to time be enacted contained provisions for the payment of wages
determined to be prevailing by the Secretary of Labor in accordance with the Davis-Bacon Act. The prevailing rates
and fringe benefits determined in these decisions shall, in accordance with the provisions of the foregoing statutes,
constitute the minimum wages payable on Federal and federally assisted construction projects to laborers and mechanics
of the specified classes engaged on contract work of the character and in the localities described therein.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Good cause is hereby found for not utilizing notice and public comment procedure thereon prior to the issuance of these
determinations as prescribed in 5 U.S.C. 553 and not providing for delay in the effective date as prescribed in that
section, because the necessity to issue current construction industry wage determinations frequently and in large
volume causes procedures to be impractical and contrary to the public interest.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
General wage determination decisions, and modifications and supersedeas decisions thereto, contain no expiration
dates and are effective from their date of notice in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, or on the date written notice is received by the agency, whichever is earlier. These decisions are to be used in accordance
with the provisions of 29 CFR parts 1 and 5. Accordingly, the applicable decision, together with any modifications
issued, must be made a part of every contract for performance of the described work within the geographic area indicated
as required by an applicable Federal prevailing wage law and 29 CFR part 5. The wage rates and fringe benefits, notice
of which is published herein, and which are contained in the Government Printing Office (GPO) document entitled ``General
Wage Determinations Issued Under The Davis-Bacon And Related Acts,'' shall be the minimum paid by contractors and
subcontractors to laborers and mechanics.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Any person, organization, or governmental agency having an interest in the rates determined as prevailing is encouraged
to submit wage rate and fringe benefit information for consideration by the Department. Further information and
self-explanatory forms for the purpose of submitting this data may be obtained by writing to the U.S. Department of
Labor, Employment Standards Administration, Wage and Hour Division, Division of Wage Determinations, 200 Constitution
Avenue, NW., room S&hyph;3014, Washington, DC 20210.

 on August 17, 1993 (58 FR 43657).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
At the request of the State Agency, the Department reviewed the certification for workers of the subject firm. The

During the meeting, panel members will hear presentations from the Department of Energy (DOE) and its contractors
on improving the efficiency of underground exploration and construction of the exploratory studies facility (ESF).
Efforts are under way to identify potential ways to reduce costs and shorten the excavation schedule by simplifying
the design of the underground facility. Additional topics that will be addressed at the meeting include how the administration's
new funding proposal for the high-level waste management program (Scenario A) will affect site-suitability issues;
how to use the tunnel boring machine most efficiently during excavation of the five-mile, portal-to-portal main
loop; how thermal loading issues could affect repository design; and how the proposed plan for 100-year retrievability,
including in Scenario A, could affect the design of the repository.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Nuclear Waste Technical Review Board was created in the 1987 amendments act to evaluate the technical and scientific
activities in the DOE's civilian radioactive waste management program, including site characterization, storage,
and transport. A site at Yucca Mountain, Nevada, currently is being characterized by the DOE for its suitability as
the possible location of a permanent repository for civilian spent fuel and defense high-level waste.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Pursuant to section 19(b)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (``Act''), 15 U.S.C. 78s(b)(1), notice is hereby
given that on April 1, 1994, the Chicago Board Options Exchange, Inc. (``CBOE'' or ``Exchange'') filed with the Securities
and Exchange Commission (``Commission'') the proposed rule change as described in Items I, II and III below, which
Items have been prepared by the CBOE. The Commission is publishing this notice to solicit comments on the proposed
rule change from interested persons.

I. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Terms of Substance of the Proposed Rule Change
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The CBOE proposes to establish the following fees: (1) A $350 monthly fee for CBOE members who install ILX/WDN personal
computer (``PC'') terminals in their floor booth(s); and (2) a $150 quarterly fee for non-clearing Designated Primary
Market Makers (``DPMMs'') for the Exchange's work in reviewing their SEC Form X&hyph;17A&hyph;5 reports and conducting
annual financial audits to ensure their compliance with the Commission's net capital rule, as amended, effective
April 1, 1994.
<FOOTCITE>1</FOOTCITE>
 In addition, the Exchange proposes to expand its customer box spread fee rebate program, which is currently limited
to positions in Standard &amp; Poor's 500 (``SPX'') index options, to make the rebate available on a member's request
for qualifying public customer positions in any and all European-style index options.

The current box spread rebate program provides a 50% rebate on transaction and trade match fees for box trades by public
customers in SPX options, provided the box trade totals 500 or more contracts for the four sides of the trade. See Securities
Exchange Act Release No. 31386 (February 8, 1993), 58 FR 8639 (File No. SR&hyph;CBOE&hyph;93&hyph;06) (``Fee Rebate
Approval Order'').

II. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In its filing with the Commission, the CBOE included statements concerning the purpose of and basis for the proposed
rule change and discussed any comments it received on the proposed rule change. The text of these statements may be
examined at the places specified in Item IV below. The CBOE has prepared summaries, set forth in sections (A), (B),
and (C) below, of the most significant aspects of such statements.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
(A) Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and the Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The purpose of the proposed rule change is to establish two new fees and to extend the CBOE's current fee rebate program
for SPX options to additional classes of European-style options. The first new fee is a $350 monthly fee to CBOE members
who install ILX/WDN PC terminals in their floor booth(s). These terminals, which will replace booth-installed Quotron
terminals, will use Windows-based software and will include and ILX window for display of market data as well as a CBOE
WDN window for internal CBOE displays and functions.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The second new fee is a $150 quarterly fee to be paid by non-clearing DPMMs for the Exchange's work in reviewing their
reports on SEC Form X&hyph;17A&hyph;5 and conducting annual financial audits of such DPMMs to ensure compliance
with the Commission's net capital rule, as amended, effective April 1, 1994.
<FOOTCITE>3</FOOTCITE>
 In the past, because non-clearing market makers were exempt from the net capital rule, the CBOE'S financial oversight
of non-clearing DPMMs was less extensive, as were the CBOE'S costs therefor. Beginning on April 1, 1994, however,
non-clearing DPMMs will be required to meet portions of the Commission's net capital rule, and the Exchange's oversight
costs will increase accordingly. The CBOE believes that the $150 quarterly fee will recover a substantial portion
of the new oversight costs which the Exchange estimates it will incur.

In addition to the two new fees described above, the CBOE proposes to expand the customer box spread fee rebate program,
which is currently limited to positions in SPX options.
<FOOTCITE>4</FOOTCITE>
 The expansion will make the rebate available on a member's request for qualifying public customer positions in any
and all European-style index options. The existing rebate program, which was approved permanently in February 1993,
<FOOTCITE>5</FOOTCITE>
 enables members to reduce certain transaction and trade match fees which they pay to the Exchange.

The terms of the fee rebate and the rebate procedures proposed for all European-style index options will be identical
to the rebate terms and procedures applicable to SPX options. Under the current rebate program, as under the proposal,
CBOE members may request a rebate of 50% of their transaction and trade match fees

four sides must expire in the same month.

The Exchange believes that the proposed rule change is consistent with section 6(b) of the Act, in general, and furthers
the objectives of section 6(b)(4), in particular, in that it provides for the equitable allocation of reasonable
dues, fees, and other charges among CBOE members and other persons using the CBOE's facilities.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
1. Bando and the SBIC Subsidiary, Wisconsin corporations, are registered closed-end investment companies. In 1992
and 1993, the SEC issued orders to permit Bando and the SBIC Subsidiary to create a holding company structure with the
SBIC Subsidiary being a wholly-owned subsidiary of Bando, and to permit Bando to issue a class of senior security (the
``Prior Order'').
<FOOTCITE>1</FOOTCITE>
 Bando was licensed to operate as a small business investment company under the Small Business Investment Act of 1958.
On March 26, 1993, Bando transferred substantially all of its assets and its small business investment company license
to the SBIC Subsidiary. Presently, the SBIC Subsidiary provides secured loans to small businesses.

(notice), and 19636 (Aug. 17, 1993) (order) (order amending initial order to permit Bando to issue one class of senior
security which is a stock).

2. Bando proposes to form two additional subsidiary corporations. One of these will be a small business lender (``the
SBL Subsidiary'') participating in a government guaranteed loan program and the other will be the ``Bankruptcy Remote
Subsidiary.'' The SBL and Bankruptcy Remote Subsidiaries will be registered closed-end investment companies under
the Act.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. Subject to the approval of the Small Business Administration (``SBA''), the SBL Subsidiary will operate as a qualified
lender licensed under the government guaranteed loan program authorized by section 7(a) of the Small Business Act
(the ``7(a) Program''). The 7(a) Program's objective is to provide funds to small business concerns, which otherwise
may have limited access to credit. The SBA guarantees up to 70 to 85% of the principal amount of loans made by lenders
under the 7(a) Program. The SBA has notified Bando that Bando's participation in the 7(a) Program must be effected
in a corporation separate from the Bando and the SBIC Subsidiary.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
4. The Bankruptcy Remote Subsidiary will facilitate the ``securitization'' of portfolio loans of Bando, the SBIC
Subsidiary, and the SBL Subsidiary. Securitization of loans held by the SBL and SBIC Subsidiaries will be effected
by the sale of the loans to Bando, followed by the sale of the loans to the Bankruptcy Remote Subsidiary. The Bankruptcy
Remote Subsidiary then will sell the loans to a ``company'' that is not taxed as a corporation under the Internal Revenue
Code, in exchange for cash and securities issued by the company. The directors of the Bankruptcy Remote Subsidiary
will not be identical to those of Bando, the SBIC Subsidiary, or the SLB Subsidiary. This will enable certain securities
issued by a company and collateralized by the loans purchased from the Bankruptcy Remote Subsidiary to obtain an investment
grade rating. A majority of the directors of the Bankruptcy Remote Subsidiary will be directors of Bando. All loans
would be sold on a non-recourse basis and neither Bando nor any of its subsidiaries would guarantee payment of such
loans.

Applicants' Legal Analysis
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
A. Section 12(d)
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
1. Section 12(d)(1) of the Act limits the amount of securities a registered investment company may hold of other investment
companies. Section 12(e) provides an exemption to the section 12(d)(1) limitations for acquisitions of securities
of certain corporations, such as those that furnish capital to industry, provided that, among other things, the aggregate
cost of the securities does not exceed 5% of the total assets of the acquiring company at the time of purchase. Subsequent
to the Bando's initial acquisition of the outstanding common stock of the SBL Subsidiary, Bando's additional purchases
of the SLB Subsidiary's common stock may exceed 5% of Bando's total assets and, therefore, the section 12(e) exemption
will no longer be available.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. In addition, because Bando will hold more than 3% of the outstanding voting stock of the SBL Subsidiary, Bando's
loans to the SBL Subsidiary could violate section 12(d)(1) if such loans were considered acquisitions of the SBL Subsidiary's
debt securities. Bando's organization of the Bankruptcy Remote Subsidiary and subsequent purchases of the subsidiary's
common stock also will violate section 12(d)(1) absent an exemption, and section 12(e) will not be available because
the Bankruptcy Remote Subsidiary will not engage in any of the businesses specified in section 12(e). Accordingly,
Bando requests an exemption from section 12(d)(1) to permit Bando to (a) make further acquisitions of the common stock
of the SBL Subsidiary, (b) acquire notes and other indebtedness of the SBL Subsidiary, and (c) acquire the common stock
of the Bankruptcy Remote Subsidiary.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
B. Section 17(a)
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
1. Section 17(a) of the Act generally prohibits sales or purchases of securities between registered investment companies
and any affiliated person of that company. Bando, the SBL Subsidiary, and the Bankruptcy Remote Subsidiary will be
affiliated persons. Since the SBL Subsidiary will be fully owned by Bando, Bando's initial acquisition of the outstanding
common stock of the SBL Subsidiary will be exempt under rule 17a&hyph;3 from section 17(a).
<FOOTCITE>2</FOOTCITE>
 In addition, applicants assert that investments in the SBL Subsidiary in the form of stock purchases, capital contributions,
or loans do not violate section 17(a) because the seller is the issuer and is controlled by Bando. Purchases and sale
of portfolio securities between Bando and the SBL Subsidiary, however, appear to be violations of section 17(a).
<FOOTCITE>3</FOOTCITE>
 Accordingly, applicants request an exemption from section 17(a) to the extent necessary to permit purchases and
sales of portfolio securities between Bando and the SBL Subsidiary.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->
Rule 17a&hyph;3 provides in part that transactions solely between a registered investment company and one or more
of its ``fully owned subsidiaries'' are exempt from section 17(a). Rule 17a&hyph;3 defines a ``fully owned subsidiary''
as a subsidiary that, among other things, is not indebted to any person other than its parent, the parent's other fully
owned subsidiaries, and/or banks or insurance companies in any amount that is material in relation to the particular
subsidiary.

</FOOTNAME>
<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->
After the SBL Subsidiary begins operations, it will no longer be considered a ``fully owned subsidiary'' under rule
17a&hyph;3 to the extent that the SBL Subsidiary becomes indebted to parties other than Bando, the SBIC Subsidiary,
the Bankruptcy Remote Subsidiary, banks, or insurance companies in any ``material amount.''
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
</FOOTNOTE>

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
2. Applicants assert that the organization and operation of the Bankruptcy Remote Subsidiary does not raise any issues
under section 17(a) because it will be able to rely on the rule 17a&hyph;3 exemption.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
C. Section 18
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
1. Section 18(a) of the Act prohibits a registered closed-end investment company from issuing any class of senior
security unless the company complies with the asset coverage requirements set forth in the section. ``Asset coverage''
is defined in section 18(h) to mean the ratio which the value of the total assets of an issuer, less all liabilities not
represented by senior securities, bears to the aggregate amount of senior securities of such issuer. Under section
18(a), senior securities of closed-end investment companies representing indebtedness must have an asset coverage
of 300% immediately after their issuance and senior securities of such companies representing stock must have an
asset coverage of 200%. Section 18(c) prohibits a registered closed-end investment company from issuing more than
one class of senior securities representing indebtedness.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. Bando, the SBL Subsidiary, and the Bankruptcy Remote Subsidiary are subject to the asset coverage requirements
of section 18(a) on an individual basis, and Bando on a consolidated basis because Bando may be an indirect issuer of
senior securities with respect to the SBL and Bankruptcy Remote Subsidiaries' indebtedness. Accordingly, Bando
would be required to treat as its own any liabilities of the SBL and Bankruptcy Remote Subsidiaries.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. Absent exemptive relief, the asset coverage limitations of section 18(a) would prevent the SBL Subsidiary from
using borrowings from Bando to fund 7(a) Program loans. Similarly, without an exemption, section 18(c) would preclude
the SBL Subsidiary from issuing more than one class of securities to finance such borrowings. In addition, if deemed
to be an indirect issuer of the SBL Subsidiary's indebtedness, sections 18 (a) and (c) would impose the same limitations
on Bando with respect to the SBL Subsidiary's borrowings on a consolidated basis. Accordingly, applicants request
an exemption from 18(a) to the extent necessary to treat the SBL Subsidiary's borrowings from Bando as ``liabilities
and indebtedness not represented by senior securities'' within the meaning of section 18(h) in applying the asset
coverage requirements of section 18(a). Applicants also request an exemption from section 18(c) to permit Bando
and the SBL Subsidiary, on an individual basis, to have more than one class of senior security representing indebtedness,
subject to condition 5 below. The organization and operation of the Bankruptcy Remote Subsidiary does not raise any
issues under section 18 because it will not issue senior securities.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
D. Sections 8 and 30
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In the absence of an exemption, each of Bando, the SBL Subsidiary, and the Bankruptcy Remote Subsidiary would be required
to file annual amendments to its registration statement and transmit to its shareholders annual and/or semi-annual
reports on form N&hyph;SAR pursuant to sections 8(b), 30(a), 30(b), and 30(d) and rules 8b&hyph;16, 30a&hyph;1,
30b1&hyph;1, and 30d&hyph;1. Applicants request an exemption to permit: (a) Bando to file on behalf of itself, the
SBL Subsidiary, and the Bankruptcy Remote Subsidiary amendments to its registration statement containing information
with respect to Bando, the SBL Subsidiary, and the Bankruptcy Remote Subsidiary on a consolidated basis only; (b)
Bando to file on behalf of itself and the SBL Subsidiary semi-annual reports on form N&hyph;SAR containing information
with respect to Bando, the SBL Subsidiary, and the Bankruptcy Remote Subsidiary on a consolidated basis only; and
(c) Bando to transmit to its shareholders semi-annually reports containing the financial information for Bando,
the SBL Subsidiary, and the Bankruptcy Remote Subsidiary on a consolidated basis only.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
E. Modification of Condition 6 of Prior Order
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
1. Condition 6 of the Prior Order provides that if 10% or more of Bando's total assets on a consolidated basis are invested
in assets other than securities issued by the SBIC Subsidiary, then, in addition to the consolidated financial statements
of Bando and the SBIC Subsidiary, there shall be included in such reports separate financial statements of the SBIC
Subsidiary. Absent exemptive relief, applicants assume that if 10% or more of Bando's total assets on a consolidated
basis are invested in assets other than the SBIC, SBL, and Bankruptcy Remote Subsidiaries, separate financial statements
would be required.

<!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
2. In the future, Bando may make loans directly and may purchase loans from the SBIC or SBL Subsidiaries, and may therefore
have more than 10% of its assets on a consolidated basis invested in assets other than the SBIC, SBL, and Bankruptcy
Remote Subsidiaries. Accordingly, applicants request that condition 6 of the Prior Order be modified to require
separate financial statements of the SBIC, SBL, and Bankruptcy Remote Subsidiaries if 10% or more of Bando's total
assets on a consolidated basis are invested in assets other than securities issued by the SBIC, SBL, and Bankruptcy
Remote Subsidiaries and securities similar to securities in which the subsidiaries invest.

F. Standards for Exemption Under Sections 6(c) and 17(b)
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
1. Section 6(c) of the Act permits the SEC to exempt any person or transaction from any provision of the Act, if such exemption
is necessary or appropriate in the public interest and consistent with the protection of investors and the purposes
fairly intended by the policy of the Act. The relationship of Bando's shareholders to the activities to be carried
out by the SBL and Bankruptcy Remote Subsidiaries will be no different than if such activities were carried out by Bando
because (a) the SBL and Bankruptcy Remote Subsidiaries will be wholly-owned subsidiaries of Bando; and (b) Bando
has agreed that it will exercise its rights as the shareholder of the SBL and Bankruptcy Remote Subsidiaries on matters
required by the Act to be approved by shareholders only as directed by Bando's shareholders. Accordingly, applicants
believe that the requested exemptions meet the section 6(c) standards.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. Section 17(b) of the Act permits the SEC to exempt a proposed transaction from section 17(a) if evidence establishes
that (a) the terms of the proposed transaction, including the consideration to be paid or received, are reasonable
and fair and do not involve overreaching on the part of any person concerned; (b) the proposed transaction is consistent
with the policy of each registered investment company concerned; and (c) the proposed transaction is consistent
with the general purposes of the Act. Applicants believe that the requested relief from section 17(a) meets these
standards.

Applicants' Conditions
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Applicants state that as a condition to the granting of the exemptive relief requested, each of Bando, the SBIC Subsidiary,
the SBL Subsidiary, and the Bankruptcy Remote Subsidiary will comply with the following conditions:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. Bando will at all times own and hold beneficially and of record all of the outstanding voting capital stock of the
SBIC, SBL, and Bankruptcy Remote Subsidiaries.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. The SBIC and SBL Subsidiaries will have the same fundamental policies of Bando, as set forth in Bando's registration
statement; the SBIC and SBL Subsidiaries will not engage in any of the activities described in section 13(a) of the
Act, except in each case as authorized by the vote of a majority of the outstanding voting securities of Bando. The Bankruptcy
Remote Subsidiary will not engage in any of the activities described in section 13(a) of the Act, except in each case
as authorized by the vote of a majority of the outstanding voting securities of Bando.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. No person shall serve or act as investment adviser to the SBIC, SBL, or Bankruptcy Remote Subsidiaries under circumstances
subject to section 15 of the Act, unless the directors and shareholders of Bando shall have taken the action with respect
thereto also required to be taken by the directors and shareholders of the SBIC, SBL, or Bankruptcy Remote Subsidiaries,
as the case may be.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. No person shall serve as a director of the SBIC, SBL, or Bankruptcy Remote Subsidiaries who shall not have been elected
as a director of Bando at its most recent annual meeting, as contemplated by section 16(a) of the Act and subject to the
provision thereof relating to the filling of vacancies, provided that the Bankruptcy Remote Subsidiary may have
two directors who are not directors of Bando as long as a majority of its board of directors consists of directors who
are also directors of Bando. Notwithstanding the foregoing, (a) the board of directors of the SBIC and SBL Subsidiaries
will be elected by Bando as the sole shareholder of both corporations, and such board will be composed of the same persons
that serve as directors of Bando and (b) the board of directors of the Bankruptcy Remote Subsidiary will be elected
by Bando as the sole shareholder of the Bankruptcy Remote Subsidiary and such board will be composed of the same persons
that serve as directors of Bando except to the extent noted above.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
5. Bando will not itself issue or sell any senior security representing indebtedness if immediately thereafter Bando
will have outstanding more than one class of senior security representing indebtedness; and Bando will not issue
or sell any senior security which is a stock if immediately thereafter Bando shall have outstanding more than one class
of senior security which is a stock, as provided under section 18(c) of the Act. Bando shall not guarantee any borrowings
of the SBIC or SBL Subsidiaries, nor shall Bando enter into any express or implied agreement that is the functional
equivalent of such a guarantee, including any agreement that will ensure that the SBIC or SBL Subsidiaries has a tangible
net worth of a specified amount. Bando will not cause or permit the SBIC or SBL Subsidiaries to issue or sell any senior
security of which the SBIC or SBL Subsidiaries is the issuer except as hereafter set forth: the SBIC and SBL Subsidiaries
may issue and sell to banks, insurance companies, and other financial institutions their secured or unsecured promissory
notes or other evidences of indebtedness in consideration of any loan, or any extension or renewal thereof made by
private arrangement, and the SBIC Subsidiary may issue debt securities held or guaranteed by SBA, provided the following
conditions are met: (a) Such notes or evidences of indebtedness are not intended to be publicly distributed; and (b)
such notes or evidences of indebtedness are not convertible into, exchangeable for or accompanied by any options
to acquire, any equity security. Immediately after the issuance or sale of any class of senior security by Bando or
the issuance or sale of any such notes or evidences by the SBIC or SBL Subsidiaries, Bando, the SBIC Subsidiary, and
the SBL Subsidiary on a consolidated basis, and Bando and the SBL Subsidiary individually, shall have the asset coverage
required by section 18(a), except that, in determining whether Bando, the SBIC Subsidiary, and the SBL Subsidiary,
on a consolidated basis, and the SBL Subsidiary on an individual basis, have the asset coverage required by section
18(a), any borrowings by the SBIC Subsidiary or any borrowings by the SBIC Subsidiary or any borrowings by the SBL Subsidiary
from Bando, for purposes of the definition of ``asset coverage'' in section 18(h), shall be treated as indebtedness
not represented by senior securities. The Bankruptcy Remote Subsidiary will not issue senior securities.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
6. Bando will file with the SEC pursuant to rule 8b&hyph;16 amendments to its registration statement pursuant to section
8(b) of the Act on behalf of itself, the SBIC Subsidiary, the SBL Subsidiary, and the Bankruptcy Remote Subsidiary
containing information with respect to, and financial statements of, Bando, the SBIC Subsidiary, the SBL Subsidiary,
and the Bankruptcy Remote Subsidiary on a consolidated basis only, such amendments to be in lieu of and in satisfaction
of the separate filing obligations of Bando, the SBIC Subsidiary, the SBL Subsidiary, and the Bankruptcy Remote Subsidiary
pursuant to rule 8b&hyph;16. Bando will file with the SEC pursuant to sections 30(a) and 30(b) of the Act and rules 30a&hyph;1

the SBL Subsidiary, and the Bankruptcy Remote Subsidiary on a consolidated basis only, such consolidated semi-annual
reports to be lieu of and in satisfaction of the separate filing obligations of Bando, the SBIC Subsidiary, and the
SBL Subsidiary pursuant to sections 30(a) and 30(b) and rules 30a&hyph;1 and 30b1&hyph;1. Bando will in response

obligations of Bando, the SBIC Subsidiary, the SBL Subsidiary, and the Bankruptcy Remote Subsidiary pursuant to
section 30(d) and rule 30d&hyph;1, only so long as the amount of Bando's total assets on a consolidated basis invested
in assets other than securities of the SBIC, SBL, and Bankruptcy Remote Subsidiaries, or securities similar to those
in which such subsidiaries invest, does not exceed 10%. Notwithstanding anything in this condition, Bando shall
not be relieved of any of its reporting obligations including, but not limited to, any consolidating statement setting
forth the individual statements of the SBIC, SBL, or Bankruptcy Remote Subsidiaries required by rule 6&hyph;03(c)

Applicants' Representations
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
1. The Partnership was organized in 1984 as a limited partnership under New York state Law. It has not been registered
under the Act in reliance upon section 3(c)(1) of the Act, and the Partnership interests have not been registered under
the Securities Act of 1933 in reliance upon section 4(2) thereof. The general partners of the Partnership, Messrs.
Stephen Ely, Colin C. Ferenbach, and Denis M. Turko (the ``General Partners''), have exclusive control over the management
and business of the Partnership. The General Partners have maintained an investment in the Partnership not less that
1% of the net assets of the Partnership, and are allocated net income, gains, and losses of the Partnership in proportion
to their respective investments.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. The Fund is the initial series of The Haven Capital Management Trust, a business trust formed under the laws of Delaware
on March 17, 1994. The Fund, an open-end management investment company, filed a notification of registration under
the Act on Form N&hyph;8A and a registration statement under the Act and the Securities Act on Form N&hyph;1A on March
18, 1994. The registration statement has not yet been declared effective, and no offering of shares has commenced.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. The Adviser is the investment adviser to the Partnership and will be the investment adviser to the Fund. PFPC, Inc.
and Provident Distributors, Inc., which are not affiliated with any of the applicants, will act as the Fund's administrator
and principal underwriter, respectively. The Fund does not currently intend to enlist the assistance of other broker-dealers
to market shares and there is no intention to advertise the Fund in newspapers or other media. Neither the Adviser nor
Provident intends to solicit widespread public interest in the Fund.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. Applicants propose that, prior to offering the shares to the public, the Fund will exchange shares for the assets
of the Partnership, less funds required to pay the liabilities of the Partnership. Thereafter, the Partnership will
dissolve and distribute the shares it received to its partners 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
pro rata
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, including the General Partners. Partners of the Partnership will constitute all of the holders of shares, except
for shares representing seed capital contributed to the Fund by the Adviser pursuant to section 14(a) of the Act. The
Fund was designed as a successor investment vehicle to the Partnership, with investment objectives and policies
substantially the same as those of the Partnership. The same persons who selected the investments for the Partnership
will select them for the Fund.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
5. The Fund intends to adopt a plan of distribution pursuant to rule 12b&hyph;1 under the Act. Under the rule 12b&hyph;1
plan, the Fund may spend no more than 0.25% of its average daily net assets for sales activities including compensation
paid to Provident and the printing and mailing of prospectuses and sales literature. The Fund will comply with rules
regarding distribution expenses adopted by the National Association of Securities Dealers.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
6. The proposed exchange will be effected pursuant to an agreement and plan of exchange (the ``Plan'') to be approved
by the limited partners of the Partnership. Under the Plan, the portfolio securities of the Partnership will be acquired
at their independent ``current market price,'' as defined in rule 17a&hyph;7 under the Act. The Fund will not acquire
securities that, in the opinion of the Adviser, are overvalued or would result in a violation of the Fund's investment
objectives, policies, or restrictions. It is not expected that the Partnership will hold any such securities. Any
remaining securities will be liquidated by the partnership for cash and these proceeds distributed 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
pro rata
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 to the partners of the Partnership.

<!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
7. The General Partners of the Partnership will consider the desirability of the exchange from the point of view of
the Partnership and must conclude that (a) the exchange is in the best interests of the Partnership and its partners
and (b) upon the exchange, the interests of the partners of the Partnership will not be diluted as a result of the exchange.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
8. The Fund's board of trustees will consider the desirability of the exchange from the point of view of the Fund and
a majority of the trustees, including a majority of the non-interested members, must conclude that: (a) The exchange
is desirable as a business matter from the point of view of the Fund; (b) the exchange is in the best interest of the Fund;
(c) upon the exchange, the interests of existing shareholders of the Fund will not be diluted as a result of the exchange;
and (d) the terms of the exchange as reflected in the Plan have been designed to meet the criteria contained in section
17(b) of the Act. The trustees will consider each aspect of the exchange, including: (i) The method of valuing the portfolio
securities to be acquired from the Partnership, (ii) the value of the shares to be delivered to the Partnership, (iii)
the procedure for selecting among the portfolio securities of the Partnership, (iv) the possibility of incurring
excessive brokerage costs, (v) the allocation of the costs of the exchange, (vi) the possibility of adverse tax consequences
to future shareholders of the Fund, (vii) the benefits from the exchange accruing to the Adviser, and (viii) the benefits
from the exchange accruing to the General Partners.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
9. The exchange will not be effected unless: (a) The registration statements of the Fund have been declared effective,
(b) the limited partners of the Partnership have approved the Plan and an amendment to the partnership agreement authorizing
the General Partners to take such actions as they deem necessary or appropriate to effect the exchange, (c) the requested
order has been granted, and (d) the limited partners have received an opinion of counsel that: (i) The distribution
of shares from the Partnership to its limited partners, which will be in liquidation of the Partnership, will not cause
taxable gain or loss to be recognized by the limited partners, (ii) the basis to the limited partners for the shares
will be equal to the adjusted basis of the limited partners' interests in the Partnership, and (iii) the limited partners'
holding periods with respect to the shares will include their holding periods for their Partnership interests.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
10. The Partnership, the Fund, and the Adviser will each pay their respective costs in connection with the forming
of the Fund and completing the exchange. No brokerage commission, fee, or other remuneration will be paid in connection
with the exchange.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
Applicants' Legal Conclusions
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
1. Section 17(a) of the Act generally prohibits an affiliated person of a registered investment company from selling
to or purchasing from such investment company any security. The Fund and the Partnership may be affiliated persons
of each other because they are under the common control of the Adviser and the General Partners. Thus, the proposed
exchange may be prohibited by section 17(a). Section 17(b) authorizes the SEC to exempt a proposed transaction from
section 17(a) if evidence establishes that the terms of the transaction, including the consideration to be paid or
received, are reasonable and fair and do not involve overreaching on the part of any person concerned, the transaction
is consistent with the policies of the registered investment company, and the transaction is consistent with the
general purposes of the Act.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. Applicants believe that the proposed transaction satisfies the criteria of section 17(b). They contend that because
the Fund and the Partnership have similar investment objectives and policies, the Fund will obtain portfolio securities
that initially will be substantially identical to those held by the Partnership. The Fund will acquire the Partnership
securities at their independent ``current market price.'' Applicants believe that this price will be as advantageous
to the Fund as open-market purchases. In addition, by acquiring suitable securities from the Partnership, the Fund
will avoid incurring brokerage and other transactions costs. Applicants believe that the exchange can be viewed
as a change in the form in which the assets are held, rather than as a disposition giving rise to section 17(a) concerns.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
1. Each Fund is an open-end management investment company registered under the Act. KFS serves as the investment adviser
and principal underwriter for each Fund. Each Fund has a non-rule 12b&hyph;1 administrative services agreement
(``Administrative Plan'') with KFS providing for a service fee
<FOOTCITE>3</FOOTCITE>
 at an annual rate of up to .25% of average daily net assets.

As used herein, the term ``service fee'' has the meaning given to that term in Article III, Section 26 of the Rules of
Fair Practice of the National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc. (``NASD'') and the term ``distribution fee''
means an ``asset-based sales charge'' as defined in said NASD rule.

2. Applicants propose to establish a Multiple Distribution System (the ``Multiple Distribution System''). Under
the Multiple Distribution System, each Fund would have the opportunity to offer investors the option of purchasing
shares subject to: (i) A front-end sales load that may vary among Funds and a service fee (``Class A shares''), (ii)
without a front-end sales load, but subject to a CDSC, a rule 12b&hyph;1 distribution fee and a service fee (the ``Deferred
Option'' or ``Class B shares''), (iii) without a front-end sales load or CDSC but subject to a rule 12b&hyph;1 plan
distribution fee and to a service fee (the ``Level Load Option'' or ``Class C shares''), and (iv) without a front-end
load, CDSC, distribution fee or service fee (``Class I shares'').

3. The Funds may create one or more additional classes of shares in the future, the terms of which will differ from the
Class A, B, C, and I shares in the following respects: Any such class: (a) May bear different distribution fees and any
other costs relating to implementing or amending the rule 12b&hyph;1 plan for such class; (b) may bear different service
fees; (c) may bear different shareholder servicing fees;
<FOOTCITE>5</FOOTCITE>
 (d) may bear different ``Class Expenses,'' that may include any or all of the following expenses: (i) Printing and
postage expenses related to preparing and distributing materials such as shareholder reports, prospectuses, and
proxy statements to current shareholders of a specific class; (ii) Commission registration fees incurred by a specific
class; (iii) litigation or other legal expenses relating to a specific class of shares; (iv) Trustee fees or expenses
incurred as a result of issues relating to a specific class; and (v) accounting expenses relating to a specific class;
(e) may bear a different name or designation; (f) will have exclusive voting rights as to any rule 12b&hyph;1 plan adopted
exclusively with respect to such class except as provided in condition 16 below; (g) may have different conversion
features; (h) may have different exchange privileges; (i) may be sold under different sales arrangements, including
selling only to a particular type of investor; and (j) may bear any other incremental expenses subsequently identified
that should be properly allocated to such class and that shall be approved by the Commission.

</FOOTNAME>
<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->
As used herein, the term ``shareholder servicing fees'' means fees and out-of-pocket expenses paid by the Funds to
their shareholder servicing agent for transfer agency, account maintenance or dividend disbursing functions or
for administering dividend reinvestment or systematic investment plans. ``Shareholder servicing fees'' does
not refer to ``service fees'' as described in Article III, section 26 of the Rules of Fair Practice of the NASD.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
</FOOTNOTE>

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
4. Any distribution arrangement of a Fund, including distribution fees, service fees, and front-end and deferred
sales loads, will comply with Article III, section 26, of the Rules of Fair Practice of the NASD.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
5. After a shareholder's Class B shares remain outstanding for a period of time, they automatically will convert to
Class A shares of the same Fund at the relative net asset values of the two classes and will thereafter not be subject
to a rule 12b&hyph;1 plan. Shares purchased through the reinvestment of distributions paid upon Class B shares will
be treated as Class B shares and will be converted to Class A shares on a 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
pro rata
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 basis with the Class B shares. The Level Load Option differs from the Deferred Option in that the Class C shares would
not automatically convert to Class A shares after a specified period of time as would the Class B shares.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
6. Any other class of Non-Institutional Shares (as defined below) may provide that shares in that class (the ``Purchase
Class'') will, after a period of time, automatically convert into another class of shares (the ``Target Class'')
on the basis of the relative net asset values of the two classes, without the imposition of any sales load, fee, or other
charge provided that, after conversion, the converted shares would be subject to an asset-based sales charge and/or
service fee, if any, that in the aggregate are lower than the asset-based sales charge and/or service fee to which the
Purchase Class shares were subject prior to the conversion.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
7. Any conversion of shares of one class to shares of another class is subject to the continuing availability of a ruling
of the Internal Revenue Service or an opinion of counsel to the effect that the conversion of shares does not constitute
a taxable event under federal income tax law. Any such conversion may be suspended if such a ruling or opinion is no longer
available.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
8. Class I shares would be offered for purchase only by the following investors (the ``Institutional Investors''):
(a) Tax-exempt retirement plans of KFS and its affiliates, and (b) the following investment advisory clients of KFS
and its investment advisory affiliates that invest at least $1 million in a Fund: (1) benefit plans unaffiliated with
KFS, such as qualified retirement plans (other than individual retirement accounts and self-directed retirement
plans), (2) banks and insurance companies unaffiliated with KFS purchasing for their own accounts, and (3) endowment
funds of non-profit organizations unaffiliated with KFS.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
9. Future classes may be offered to meet the specific investment needs of non-institutional investors (herein, such
future classes together with Class A, B, and C shares are ``Non-Institutional Shares''). Other future classes, in
addition to Class I shares, may be offered to meet the specific investment needs of a particular category of Institutional
Investor (together with Class I shares, ``Institutional Shares''). Still other future classes may be offered to
various market segments or through various types of intermediaries.

<!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
10. Only Institutional Investors will be eligible to invest in Institutional Shares. Applicants may choose not to
make a particular class of Institutional Shares available to one or more categories of Institutional Investors.
If no class of Institutional Shares is made available to a particular category of Institutional Investor, Institutional
Investors in this category will be permitted to purchase Non-Institutional Shares. However, no Institutional Investor
that is eligible to invest in any class of Institutional Shares will be permitted by applicants to invest in any class
of Non-Institutional Shares. Accordingly, there will be no overlap between the investors eligible to invest in Institutional
Shares and investors eligible to invest in Non-Institutional Shares of a Fund or series thereof.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
11. Under the Multiple Distribution System, certain expenses may be attributable to a Fund, but not to a particular
series thereof. All such expenses will be borne by each class on the basis of the relative aggregate net assets of the
classes, except in the case of a Fund that has series, in which case they will first be allocated among series, based
on the relative aggregate net assets of such series. Expenses that are attributable to a particular series, but not
to a particular class thereof, will be borne by each class on the basis of the relative aggregate net assets of the classes.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
12. Applicants also propose to assess and, under certain circumstances, waive or reduce a CDSC on certain redemptions
of their shares. The CDSC will not be imposed upon a redemption of shares that were purchased more than a specified period
of time prior to the redemption (the ``CDSC Period'') or upon shares derived from reinvestment of distributions.
Furthermore, no CDSC will be imposed upon an amount that represents share appreciation.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
13. The Funds request the ability to waive the CDSC as described below: (a) On redemptions following the total disability
(as evidenced by a determination by the federal Social Security Administration) of the shareholder (including a
registered joint owner) occurring after the purchase of the shares being redeemed, (b) in the event of the death of
the shareholder (including a registered joint owner), (c) on redemptions pursuant to the Funds' right to liquidate
small accounts or to charge an annual small account fee, (d) on redemptions of shares acquired as a result of the investment
of distributions from shares of a class of one Fund into shares of the same class of another Fund, (e) for redemptions
made pursuant to a systematic withdrawal plan, and (f) in connection with the following redemptions of shares held
by employer sponsored employee benefit plans maintained on the subaccount record keeping system made available
by KFS: (i) Redemptions to satisfy participant loan advances (loan repayments would constitute new purchases for
purposes of the contingent deferred sales charge and the conversion privilege), (ii) redemptions in connection
with retirement distributions (limited at any one time to 10% of the total value of plan assets invested in the Fund),
(iii) redemptions in connection with distributions qualifying under the hardship provisions of Internal Revenue
Code section 403(b)(7) or in Treasury Regulation 401(k)&hyph;1(d)(2), as amended, and (iv) redemptions representing
returns of excess contributions to such plans.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
14. The Funds will provide a credit (i.e., a reimbursement) for any CDSC paid by a redeeming shareholder in connection
with a redemption of shares of a class followed by a reinvestment in any shares of the same class of the same Fund or, as
permitted by KFS, the same class of another Fund, effected within such number of days of the redemption as may be specified
in a Fund's prospectus. The CDSC credit will be paid by KFS. Upon redemption thereafter, when calculating the amount
of the CDSC the shares will be deemed to have been held for the period from purchase through reinvestment, except for
the period between redemption and reinvestment, until such shares are finally redeemed.

Applicants' Legal Analysis
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
1. The creation of multiple classes of shares may result in shares of a class having priority over another class as to
payment of dividends and having unequal voting rights, because under the proposed arrangement: (1) Shareholders
of different classes (i) would pay different fees because of the rule 12b&hyph;1 plan (and related costs) and (ii)
may pay different service fees, shareholder servicing fees and Class Expenses and (2) each class would be entitled
to exclusive voting rights as to matters concerning its rule 12b&hyph;1 plan.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. The abuses that section 18 of the Act is intended to address as set forth in section 1(b) of the Act are that the interest
of investors are adversely affected when investment companies by excessive borrowing and the issuance of excessive
amounts of senior securities increase unduly the speculative character of their junior securities or operate without
adequate assets or reserves. The Multiple Distribution System does not involve borrowings and does not affect the
Funds' existing assets or reserves. In addition, the proposed arrangement will not increase the speculative character
of the shares of the Funds, since all such shares will participate 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
pro rata 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
in all the Fund's appreciation, income and expenses (with the exception of the different distribution fees payable
by each class of shares and any other costs relating to implementing the rule 12b&hyph;1 plan for such class or an amendment
to such plan including obtaining shareholder approval of the rule 12b&hyph;1 plan for such class or any amendment
to such plan), any different service fees, shareholder servicing fees, and Class Expenses.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
3. Applicants believe that the imposition of the CDSC is fair and in the best interests of their shareholders. The proposed
CDSC provides shareholders the advantage of having more investment dollars working for them from the time of their
purchase than if a sales load were imposed at the time of purchase. Furthermore, the CDSC described above is fair to
shareholders because it applies only to amounts representing purchase payments and does not apply to amounts representing
share appreciation, or to amounts representing reinvestment of distributions.

Applicants Conditions
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Applicants agree that the order of the Commission granting the requested relief shall be subject to the following
conditions:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. Each class of shares will represent interests in the same portfolio of investments of a Fund, and be identical in
all respects to each other class, except as set forth below. The only differences among the various classes of shares
of the same Fund will relate solely to: (a) Different distribution fee payments associated with any rule 12b&hyph;1
plan for a particular class of shares and any other costs relating to implementing or amending such Plan (including
obtaining shareholder approval of such Plan or any amendment thereto) which will be borne solely by shareholders
of such classes, (b) different service fees, (c) different shareholder servicing fees, (d) different Class Expenses,
which will be limited to the following expenses determined by the Trustees to be attributable to a specific class of
shares: (i) Printing and postage expenses related to preparing and distributing materials such as shareholder reports,
prospectuses, and proxy statements to current shareholders of a specific class; (ii) Commission registration fees
incurred by a specific class; (iii) litigation or other legal expenses relating to a specific class; (iv) Trustee
fees or expenses incurred as a result of issues relating to a specific class; and (v) accounting expenses relating
to a specific class; (e) the voting rights related to any 12b&hyph;1 Plan affecting a specific class of shares, except
as provided in condition 16 below; (f) conversion features; (g) exchange privileges; and (h) class names or designations.
Any additional incremental expenses not specifically identified above which are subsequently identified and determined
to be properly applied to one class of shares shall not be so applied unless and until approved by the Commission by an
amended order.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. The Trustees of each Fund, including a majority of the Independent Trustees, will approve the Multiple Distribution
System for a particular Fund prior to its implementation by that Fund. The minutes of the meetings of the Trustees of
each Fund regarding the deliberations of the Trustees with respect to the approvals necessary to implement the Multiple
Distribution System will reflect the reasons for the Trustees' determination that the proposed Multiple distribution
System is in the best interests of both the Fund and its shareholders.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. The initial determination of any Class Expenses that will be applied to a class and any subsequent changes thereto
will be reviewed and approved by a vote of the Board of Trustees, including a majority of the non-interested Trustees.
Any persons authorized to direct the application and disposition of monies paid or payable by the Fund to meet Class
Expenses shall provide to the Board of Trustees, and the Trustees shall review at least quarterly, a written report
of the amounts so expended and the purposes for which such expenditures were made.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. Any distributor will adopt compliance standards as to when each class of shares may be sold to particular investors.
Applicants will require all persons selling shares of the Funds to conform to such standards; and such compliance
standards will require that all investors eligible to purchase Institutional Shares will be sold only Institutional
Shares rather than any other class of shares offered by a Fund, and that all investors eligible to purchase Non-Institutional
Shares will be sold only Non-Institutional Shares.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
5. The Administrative Plan will be adopted and operated in accordance with the procedures set forth in rule 12b&hyph;1(b)
through (f) as if the expenditures made thereunder were subject to rule 12b&hyph;1, except that shareholders need
not enjoy the voting rights specified in rule 12b&hyph;1.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
6. On an ongoing basis, the Trustees of the Funds, pursuant to their fiduciary responsibilities under the Act and otherwise,
will monitor each Fund for the existence of any material conflicts among the interests of the various classes of shares.
The Trustees, including a majority of the Independent Trustees, shall take such action as is reasonably necessary
to eliminate any such conflicts that may develop. KFS will be responsible for reporting any potential or existing
conflicts to the Trustees. If a conflict arises, KFS at its own cost will remedy such conflict up to and including establishing
a new registered management investment company.

<!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
7. The Trustees of the Funds will receive quarterly and annual statements concerning distribution and servicing
expenditures complying with paragraph (b)(3)(ii) of rule 12b&hyph;1, as it may be amended from time to time. In the
statements only expenditures properly attributable to the sale or servicing of a particular class of shares will
be used to support any distribution or service fee charged to that class. Expenditures not related to the sale or servicing
of a particular class will not be presented to the Trustees to support any distribution or servicing fee attributable
to that class. The statements, including the allocations upon which they are based, will be subject to the review of
the Independent Trustees in the exercise of their fiduciary duties.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
8. Dividends paid by a Fund as to each class of its shares, to the extent any dividends are paid, will be calculated in
the same manner, at the same time, on the same day, and will be in the same amount, except that any distribution fees,
service fees, shareholder servicing fees and Class Expenses allocated to a class will be borne exclusively by that
class.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
9. The methodology and procedures for calculating the net asset value and dividends and distributions of the various
classes and the proper allocation of expenses between or among the various classes has been reviewed by an expert (the
``Expert'') who has rendered to the applicants a report, which has been provided to the staff of the Commission, stating
that such methodology and procedures are adequate to ensure that such calculations and allocations will be made in
an appropriate manner. On an ongoing basis, the Expert, or an appropriate substitute Expert, will monitor the manner
in which the calculations and allocations are being made and, based upon such review, will render at least annually
a report to the Funds that the calculations and allocations are being made properly. The reports of the Expert shall
be filed as part of the periodic reports filed with the Commission pursuant to sections 30(a) and 30(b)(1) of the Act.
The work papers of the Expert concerning such reports, following request by the Funds which the Funds agree to make,
will be available for inspection by the Commission staff upon the written request to the Fund for such work papers by
a senior member of the Division of Investment Management or of a Regional Office of the Commission, limited to the Director,
an Associate Director, the Chief Accountant, the Chief Financial Analyst, an Assistant Director and any Regional
Administrators or Associate and Assistant Regional Administrators. The initial report of the Expert is a ``Report
on Policies and Procedures in Existence,'' and the ongoing reports will be ``Reports on Policies and Procedures Placed
in Operation and Tests of Operating Effectiveness,'' as defined and described in SAS No. 70 of the AICPA, as it may be
amended from time to time, or in similar auditing standards as they may be adopted by the AICPA from time to time.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
10. Applicants have adequate facilities in place to ensure implementation of the methodology and procedures for
calculating the net asset value and dividends and distributions of the various classes of shares and the proper allocation
of expenses between or among such classes of shares; and this representation has been concurred with by the Expert
in the initial report referred to in condition (9) above and will be concurred with by the Expert, or an appropriate
substitute Expert, on an ongoing basis at least annually in the ongoing reports referred to in condition (9) above.
Applicants agree to take immediate corrective action if the Expert, or appropriate substitute Expert, does not so
concur with the ongoing reports.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
11. The prospectuses of each Fund will contain a statement to the effect that a salesperson and any other person entitled
to receive compensation for selling or servicing Fund shares may receive different compensation as to one class of
Fund shares in relation to another.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
12. The conditions pursuant to which the exemptive order is granted and the duties and responsibilities of the Trustees
of the Funds concerning the Multiple Distribution System will be set forth in guidelines that will be furnished to
the Trustees as part of the materials setting forth the duties and responsibilities of the Trustees.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
13. Each Fund will disclose the respective expenses, performance data, distribution arrangements, services, fees,
sales loads, deferred sales loads, conversion features, and exchange privileges applicable to each class of shares
other than Institutional Shares in every prospectus, regardless of whether all classes of shares are offered through
each prospectus. Institutional Shares will be offered solely pursuant to a separate prospectus. The prospectus
for Institutional Shares will disclose the existence of the Fund's other classes, and the prospectus for the Fund's
other classes will disclose the existence of Institutional Shares and will identify the persons eligible to purchase
Institutional Shares. The shareholder reports on each Fund will disclose the respective expenses and performance
data applicable to each class of shares. The shareholder reports will contain, in the statement of assets and liabilities
and statement of operations, information related to the Fund as a whole and not on a per class basis. Each Fund's per
share data, however, will be prepared on a per class basis for all classes of shares of that Fund. To the extent that any
advertisement or sales literature describes the expenses or performance data applicable to any class of shares,
it will disclose the expenses and/or performance data applicable to all classes of shares except Institutional Shares.
Advertising materials reflecting the expenses or performance data for Institutional Shares will be available only
to those persons eligible to purchase Institutional Shares. The information provided by applicants for publication
in any newspaper or similar listing of the Funds' net asset values and public offering prices will present separately
each class of shares except Institutional Shares.

14. Applicants acknowledge that the grant of the exemptive order requested by the application will not imply Commission
approval, authorization, or acquiescence in any particular level of payments that the Funds may make pursuant to
their rule 12b&hyph;1 distribution plans or Administrative Plan in reliance upon the exemptive order.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
15. Purchase Class shares will convert into Target Class shares on the basis of the relative net asset values of the
two classes, without the imposition of any sales load, fee, or other charge. After conversion, the converted shares
will be subject to an asset-based sales charge and/or service fee (as those terms are defined in Article III, section
26 of the NASD's Rules of Fair Practice), if any, that in the aggregate are lower than the asset-based sales charge and
service fee to which they were subject prior to the conversion.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
16. If a Fund implements any amendment to its rule 12b&hyph;1 Plan (or, if presented to shareholders, adopts or implements
any amendment of a non-rule 12b&hyph;1 service plan) that would increase materially the amount that may be borne by
the Target Class shares under the plan, existing Purchase Class shares will stop converting into Target Class shares
unless the Purchase Class shareholders, voting separately as a class, approve the proposal. The Trustees shall take
such actions as are necessary to ensure that existing Purchase Class shares are exchanged or converted into a new class
of shares (``New Target Class''), identical in all material respects to the Target Class as it existed prior to implementation
of the proposal, no later than such shares previously were scheduled to convert into the Target Class. If deemed advisable
by the Trustees to implement the foregoing, such action may include the exchange of all existing Purchase Class shares
for a new class (``New Purchase Class''), identical to the existing Purchase Class shares in all material respects
except that New Purchase Class will convert into New Target Class. The New Target Class or the New Purchase Class may
be formed without further exemptive relief. Exchanges or conversions described in this condition shall be effected
in a manner that the Trustees reasonably believe will not be subject to federal taxation. In accordance with condition
6 above, any additional cost associated with the creation, exchange, or conversion of the New Target Class or the New
Purchase Class shall be borne solely by the investment adviser and principal underwriter. Purchase Class shares
sold after the implementation of the proposal may convert into Target Class shares subject to the higher maximum payment,
provided that the material features of the Target Class plan and the relationship of such plan to the Purchase Class
shares are disclosed in an effective registration statement.

17. Applicants will comply with the provisions of proposed rule 6c&hyph;10 under the Act, Investment Company Act
Release No. 16619 (November 2, 1988) as such rule is currently proposed and as it may be reproposed, adopted, or amended.

1. Each Series will be a series of applicant, a unit investment trust registered under the Act. Prudential Securities
Incorporated (``Prudential'') is applicant's depositor. Prudential currently intends to offer a new Series four
times a year at about the beginning of each calendar quarter.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. Each Series' investment objective is to provide total return through a combination of potential capital appreciation
and current dividend income. Each Series will invest approximately 20%, but in no event more than 20.5%,
<FOOTCITE>1</FOOTCITE>
 of the value of such Series' total assets in each of the five lowest dollar price per share stocks of the ten common stocks
in the Dow Jones Industrial Average (``DJIA'') having the highest dividend yields. Dividend yields will be calculated
by annualizing the last quarterly or semi-annual ordinary dividend distributed on that security and dividing the
result by the market value of the security at the close of the New York Stock Exchange either on or shortly before such
Series' initial date of deposit.

</FOOTNAME>
<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->
Prudential will attempt to purchase securities so that each of the five common stocks in a Series portfolio represents
twenty percent of the value of a Series' total assets on the initial date of deposit. Prudential may purchase the securities
for a Series in odd lots in order to achieve this goal. However, it is more efficient if securities are purchased in 100
share lots and 50 share lots. As a result, a Series may purchase securities of a securities related issuer that represent
over twenty percent, but in no event more than 20.5 percent, of a Series' assets on the initial date of deposit to the
extent necessary to enable Prudential to meet its purchase requirements and to obtain the best price for the securities.

3. The DJIA comprises 30 widely-held common stocks listed on the New York Stock Exchange which are chosen by the editors
of 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
The Wall Street Journal. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The DJIA is the property of Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc., which is not affiliated with Prudential or any Series, and
does not participate in any way in the creation of any Series or the selection of its stocks.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. The securities deposited in each Series will be chosen solely according to the formula described above, and will
not necessarily reflect the research opinions or buy or sell recommendations of Prudential. Prudential will have
no discretion as to which securities are purchased. Securities deposited in a Series may include securities of issuers
that derived more than fifteen percent of their gross revenues in their most recent fiscal year from securities related
activities.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
5. During the 90-day period following the initial date of deposit, Prudential may deposit additional securities,
maintaining to the extent practicable the original proportionate relationship among the number of shares of each
stock in the portfolio. Subsequent deposits made after the 90-day period following the initial date of deposit must
replicate exactly (subject to certain limited exceptions) the proportionate relationship among the face amounts
of the securities comprising the portfolio at the end of the initial 90-day period, whether or not a stock continues
to be among the five highest dividend yielding stocks.

6. A Series' portfolio will not be actively managed. Sales of portfolio securities will be made in connection with
redemptions and at the termination of the trust. Prudential will have no discretion as to when securities will be sold
except that it is authorized to direct the trustee to sell securities upon failure of the issuer of a security held by
a Series to declare or pay anticipated cash dividends, institution of certain materially adverse legal proceedings
against the issuer, default by the issuer under certain documents materially and adversely affecting future declaration
or payment of dividends, or the occurrence of other market or credit factors that, in the opinion of Prudential, would
make retention of such securities by a Series detrimental to the interests of the unit holders. The adverse financial
condition of an issuer will not necessarily require the sale of its securities from a Series' portfolio.

Applicant's Legal Analysis
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
1. Section 12(d)(3), with limited exceptions, prohibits an investment company from acquiring any security issued
by any person who is a broker, dealer, underwriter, or investment adviser. Rule 12d3&hyph;1(b) exempts from section
12(d)(3) purchases by an investment company of securities of an issuer that derived more than fifteen percent of its
gross revenues in its most recent fiscal year from securities related activities, provided that, among other things,
immediately after such acquisition, the acquiring company has invested not more than five percent of the value of
its total assets in securities of the issuer. Notwithstanding the above, rule 12d3&hyph;1(c) prohibits any registered
investment company from acquiring any security issued by that company from acquiring any security issued by that
company's investment adviser, promoter, or principal underwriter, or any affiliated person of such investment
adviser, promoter, or principal underwriter.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. Applicant seeks an exemption to permit any Series to invest up to approximately twenty percent, but in no event more
than 20.5 percent, of the value of its total assets in securities of an issuer that derives more than fifteen percent
of its gross revenues from securities related activities. Applicant and each series will comply with all of the provisions
of rule 12d3&hyph;1, except for the five percent limitation on the amount of assets that may be invested in securities
of issuers that derived more than fifteen percent of their gross revenues from securities related activities in their
most recent fiscal year.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. Applicant asserts that section 12(d)(3) was intended to prevent investment companies from exposing their assets
to the entrepreneurial risk of securities related businesses, to prevent potential conflicts of interest, and to
eliminate certain reciprocal practices between investment companies and securities related businesses.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. One potential conflict discussed by applicant could occur if an investment company purchased securities or other
interests in a broker-dealer to reward that broker-dealer for selling fund shares, rather than solely on investment
merit. Applicant argues that this concern does not arise in connection with its application because neither the applicant
nor the sponsor has discretion in choosing the securities or percentage amount purchased. The security must first
be included in the DJIA, which is unaffiliated with Prudential and applicant, and must also qualify as one of the five
highest dividend yielding securities as calculated by the objective formula described above.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
5. Applicant also states that the effect of a Series' purchase on the stock of parents of broker-dealers would be 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
de minmis
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. Applicant asserts that the common stocks of securities related issuers represented in the DJIA are widely held,
have active markets, and that potential purchases by any Series would represent an insignificant amount of the outstanding
common stock and the trading volume of any of these issues. According to applicant, it is highly unlikely that purchases
of these securities by a Series would have any significant impact on the market valuer of any such securities.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
6. Another potential conflict of interest discussed by applicant could occur if an investment company directed brokerage
to a broker-dealer in which the company has invested to enhance the broker-dealer's profitability or to assist it
during financial difficulty, even though the broker-dealer may not offer the best price and execution. To preclude
this type of conflict, applicant and each Series agree, as a condition of this application, that no company held in
the portfolio of a Series nor any affiliate thereof will act as broker for any Series in the purchase or sale of any security
for its portfolio.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
7. Applicant states that the requested relief is appropriate in the public interest and consistent with the protection
of investors and the purposes fairly intended by the policy and provisions of the Act.

Applicant's Condition
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Applicant agrees that the requested exemptive order may be conditioned upon no company held in the portfolio of a Series,
nor any affiliate thereof, acting as broker for any Series in the purchase of any security for the Series' portfolio.

Once operational, the Project would be a qualifying cogeneration facility under the Public Utility Regulatory Policies
Act of 1978 (``PURPA''). JV Sub is a wholly owned subsidiary of the Joint Venture, a general partnership owned equally
by Energy Sub and ARK Energy, Inc. (``ARK''), a nonassociate corporation. JV Sub, a corporation, has a 1% interest
in the Partnership. The two limited partners are Energy Sub and ARK. They each hold a 49.5% interest in the Partnership.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
By subsequent order dated August 6, 1992 (HCAR No. 25599) (``August Order''), the Commission authorized, among other
things, certain technical changes to the Project description and the Partnership to enter into a construction agreement
with Energy or Energy Sub for the purpose of developing and constructing the Project. The August Order also authorized
the Applicants to increase the amount of Construction Financing to $135 million and to increase the amount of capital
contributions that Energy Sub and ARK would each contribute to the Partnership to $13.5 million.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
By order dated March 19, 1993 (HCAR No. 25762) (``March Order''), the Applicants were authorized to: (1) increase
the amount of Construction Financing to $160 million (2) increase the maximum amount, excluding advances, as defined
below, of the aggregate equity contributions to the Partnership by JV Sub and Energy Sub to $32 million, constituting
a maximum equity contribution equal to 20% of the amount to be financed; and (3) make, directly or indirectly through
Energy, loans, open account advances, or additional equity contributions to the Partnership in an aggregate amount
not to exceed $85 million (``Advances'').
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
By order dated January 31, 1994 (HCAR No. 25983), the Commission authorized a change in the description of the Project
and the formation of CSW Mulberry. In addition, the Commission authorized the investment of a new limited partner
(``New Limited Partner'') in the Partnership in lieu of the term loan financing for the Project and the issuance of
corporate guaranties by the Applicants or stand-by letters of credit with the Applicants as account party in an amount
not to exceed $50 million, such guaranties or letters of credit to support payment obligations of the Partnership
required by the provider of third party financing for the Project or fuel suppliers, fuel transportation or other
third parties under various project agreements.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Applicants now propose that Energy Sub form a special purpose wholly owned subsidiary to be known as CSW Mulberry
II, Inc. (``Mulberry LP Sub''). Mulberry LP Sub would be incorporated under the laws of the State of Delaware with an
authorized capital of up to 1,000 shares of common stock without par value. In exchange for an assignment from Energy
Sub to Mulberry LP Sub of all of Energy Sub's right, title and interest in and to CSW Mulberry, Energy Sub would subscribe
to all of Mulberry LP Sub's common stock. It is further proposed that the Joint Venture form a special purpose wholly
owned subsidiary to be known as Polk Power GP II, Inc. (``Mulberry GP Sub''). Mulberry GP Sub would be incorporated
under the laws of the State of Delaware with an authorized capital of up to 1,000 shares of common stock without par value.
In exchange for an assignment from the Joint Venture to Mulberry GP Sub of all of the Joint Venture's right, title and
interest in and to JV Sub, the Joint Venture would subscribe to all of Mulberry GP Sub's common stock.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In the event that Mulberry LP Sub and Mulberry GP Sub are formed pursuant to the authority sought, the Applicants request
authority to include Mulberry LP Sub and Mulberry GP Sub in the flow of funds for equity contributions, open account
advances and intercompany loans on the terms and in the manner authorized by the prior orders of the Commission in this
matter, above.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Applicants request the authority to form Mulberry LP Sub and Mulberry GP Sub in order to limit the liability of Energy
Sub and the Joint Venture and aid in the procurement of the Term Financing. It is anticipated that a pledge of the stock
of CSW Mulberry and JV Sub by their holders, Energy Sub and the Joint Venture, respectively, which was required in connection
with the Construction Financing, will be required in connection with the Term Financing. The requested authority
is desirable to limit the liability of Energy Sub and the Joint Venture, which have acquired interests in several other
partnerships and corporations that are unaffiliated with the Project. If Energy Sub and the Joint Venture make such
pledges and the Partnership defaults in its repayment obligations under the terms of such Construction Financing
or Term Financing, interests of Energy Sub and the Joint Venture that are not associated with the Project could be adversely
affected by the actions taken by the provider(s) of such Construction Financing or Term Financing.

GPU Nuclear Corporation (``GPUN''), One Upper Pond Road, Parsippany, NJ 07054, a wholly owned utility subsidiary
company of General Public Utilities Corporation (``GPU''), a registered holding company, has filed an application
under Sections 9(a) and 10 of the Act.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
GPUN proposes to offer to non-affiliates, with nuclear or non-nuclear plants in the U.S. and abroad, a range of services
that are based on the skills, expertise, experience, resources and facilities that it has developed relative to its
normal core business operations (``Services''). The application outlines three general categories of Services
that GPUN now contemplates_(i) Engineering and Technical Services, which would include power plant inspections
and risk analysis, power plant accident analysis, power plant stress analysis, power plant operations analysis,
power plant life extension analysis, nuclear fuels cycle analysis, power plant modification, design, installation,
evaluation, testing and project management, power plant equipment corrosion control and failure analysis, chemical
and metallurgical laboratory services, human factors engineering services, commercial grade dedication of equipment,
radioactive waste services, plant decommissioning services, mechanical, electrical and structural engineering
services, nondestructive testing and examination services, and instrument calibration services; (ii) Management
and Consulting Services, which would include nuclear plant decommissioning and decontamination management and
consulting services, nuclear plant outage management and consulting services, quality assurance audits, medical
services management and consulting services, and Final Safety Analysis Report licensing consultation and operations
analysis; and (iii) Training and Education Services, which would include computer-based training, instructor
training, nuclear plant operating room simulator certification and training, simulator maintenance and modification
training, fire safety and plant and facility security training, and diesel equipment training.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The application also proposes to license or lease to non-affiliates the use of intellectual and proprietary property
as well as the reserve capacity of laboratory or other support facilities. It is stated that the reserve capacity licensed
or leased would not exceed 50% of the capacity of the laboratory and other support facilities available to GPUN.

<!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The application proposes that GPUN be authorized through December 31, 1999 to enter into agreements, with terms of
up to ten years and negotiated on an arm's-length basis, for the Services. It is stated that revenues received and expenses
incurred in connection with the Services will be accounted for under appropriate accounts in accordance with the
Uniform System of Accounts. The application also states that the net revenues from the Services will be used to reduce
the cost of GPUN service charges to GPU electric public utilities.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The application states that GPUN expects not to materially increase its staff or capital investments to provide the
Services. In addition, it is stated that for the five-year period for which an authorization is sought, the aggregate
annual revenues from and expenses associated with the Services are not anticipated to exceed 5% of the total annual
operating expenses of GPUN, which in 1993 were $421 million.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The application states that it could be advantageous to provide the Services through one or more new wholly-owned
subsidiaries, each of which the application proposes that GPU form and acquire through the purchase of $1,000 in capital
stock. Finally, the application states that GPUN will, on or before May 1, of each year, report to the Commission the
Services provided for the preceding year as well as the revenues derived therefrom and the expenses associated therewith.

 The FHWA and the FTA request comments which will be used in developing and conducting a review of the Congestion Mitigation
and Air Quality Improvement (CMAQ) Program, to be undertaken by the FHWA and the FTA in cooperation with the Environmental
Protection Agency (EPA). The review's purpose is to determine whether the CMAQ program is meeting its goals under
the Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act (ISTEA), Public Law 102&hyph;240, 105 Stat. 1914, and the
Clean Air Act (CAA) as amended in 1990, Public Law 101&hyph;549, 104 Stat. 2399, to support transportation measures
intended to assist nonattainment areas in meeting the National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS) and to maximize
the program's effectiveness. Comments are solicited on the structure and content of the program review, specific
policy questions raised in this notice, and other areas of policy and implementation which should be investigated.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(I) Background 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
Authorized at $6 billion for years 1992&hyph;1997, the CMAQ Program provides funds to States for transportation
projects and programs that will contribute to attainment of an NAAQS. The Program focuses primarily on reductions
in ozone precursors (hydrocarbons and oxides of nitrogen) and carbon monoxide emissions, but under certain conditions
funds may be expended on projects to reduce small particulate matter (PM&hyph;10), as well. Typical projects include:
development of HOV lanes, improvements to public transit facilities and equipment, traffic signalization and incident
management improvements, bicycle and pedestrian projects, new ridesharing services, and establishment of vehicle
inspection and maintenance programs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FHWA and the FTA, in consultation with the EPA, issued guidance providing eligibility criteria to govern CMAQ
program expenditures on October 16, 1992. A series of questions and answers were also issued subsequent to the program
guidance to address specific issues and eligibility questions as they have arisen. The program guidance was published
in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 on January 4, 1993 (58 FR 146) and, with the questions and answers, is available through the Federal Electronic Bulletin
Board System (202&hyph;366&hyph;3764). In addition, a brochure, ``A Guide to the Congestion Mitigation and Air
Quality Improvement Program,'' was issued in January 1994. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Three apportionments have been made for fiscal years 1992&hyph;1994, making a total of $2.7 billion available for
the States' use. In FY 1992, $340 million was obligated by all States which was 42 percent of the amount available. In
FY 1993, $600 million was obligated for a rate of 62 percent. Overall, $940 million was obligated during the program's
first two years for a cumulative rate of 53 percent. Unobligated funds under the CMAQ program lapse and are no longer
available to the States after four years from the beginning of the fiscal year for which they were apportioned. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
(II) Proposed Purpose and Scope 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As with any new program, implementation of the CMAQ program has generated questions about new areas of eligibility,
the purpose and effectiveness of funded projects and the coordination processes between transportation and air
quality agencies at the Federal, State and local levels. Consequently, a review of CMAQ program implementation will
be undertaken, as noted in the FHWA&hyph;FTA program guidance of October 16, 1992. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
(A) Purpose
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The review has two intended purposes: (1) To determine whether the CMAQ Program is meeting its goals under ISTEA and
the CAA to support transportation measures intended to assist nonattainment areas to meet the National Ambient Air
Quality Standards, and (2) to identify how the CMAQ program's benefits can be maximized. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
(B) Objectives
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(1) To evaluate the kinds of projects funded under the CMAQ program, their emission reductions, cost-effectiveness,
the length of time the funding process took, and other attributes, and to determine what was not funded. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) To determine what transportation control measures (TCMs) have been included in the States' Implementation Plans
and whether funding sources have been identified for them. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) To raise key issues, like the air quality impacts of various TCMs such as traffic flow improvements, possible obstacles
to innovative projects, etc., and to evaluate those issues. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) To identify any barriers or constraints to effective program implementation, especially with respect to coordination
processes between transportation and air quality agencies at the Federal, State and local levels. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5) To identify, document and disseminate examples of well-thought-out projects, project development and coordination
processes, and transportation/air quality analytical techniques for each of the transportation-related pollutants.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(6) To determine the effectiveness of current guidance, with an eye toward possible mid-course policy adjustments.

(7) To determine how projects funded under the CMAQ program affect greenhouse gases. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
(C) Approach 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The review will be conducted by the FHWA and the FTA, in cooperation with the EPA. It will be conducted in an open way to
solicit concerns, recommendations and issues from all interested parties, including environmental groups, transportation
agencies, energy interests, State air quality agencies and others. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A public meeting will be held to solicit ideas from any group wishing to comment, especially national transportation
and air quality groups, State and local agencies, environmental interest groups, industry groups, and other interested
parties. Those commenting should address the structure of the review, relevant policy questions, and their experience
in program implementation. The need for a second meeting to describe review findings will be determined as the evaluation
progresses. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The review will focus on the effectiveness of current policies and guidance as implemented at the project level. As
such, the review will begin and end with policy considerations, but any potential changes in policy will be based on
a review of specific projects and existing coordination processes. Issues will be examined from both a public policy
and legal perspective with review of the CMAQ provisions of the ISTEA (Section 1008) and other relevant provisions
of the ISTEA or CAA, as necessary. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
(D) Policy Questions 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Several policy questions have arisen as CMAQ program implementation has progressed. They serve as a starting point
for the review. Other policy considerations will be evaluated as they arise. Current questions include: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Have the needed coordination mechanisms between the transportation and air quality communities at the Federal,
State and local levels been established? Have they been effective? What have the impediments been? What can Federal
agencies do to smooth coordination processes? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) How effective are the projects that have been funded under the CMAQ program in reducing transportation emissions?
How can their effectiveness be improved? Is it possible at this time to identify the types of projects that have the
greatest air quality impact? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) What are the short term and long term impacts of funded projects? How should these considerations be included in
the determination of funding priorities under the CMAQ program? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) Will the low obligation rate for the first two years of the program ultimately result in the lapsing of Federal funds?
What can be done to avoid this? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5) How should projects that have the potential to increase oxides of nitrogen be treated? Should they be eligible
as long as aggregate emissions are reduced in line with the Clean Air Act's conformity requirements? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(6) Under current guidance, new or expanded rideshare services are eligible for CMAQ funds, but the routine funding
of existing services for ridesharing, transit, traffic control and inspection and maintenance programs, etc.,
is ineligible. Is the current policy too restrictive because it assumes that further emission reductions will not
result by funding currently existing services? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(7) Traffic flow improvements are legislatively eligible for CMAQ funding as a transportation control measure identified
in the Clean Air Act. What are the pros and cons of funding these projects for emission reduction purposes? Should changes
be pursued to exclude them from eligibility? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(8) Under the current legislation, projects in a nonattainment area are no longer eligible for CMAQ funds once the
area achieves attainment of the NAAQS and is redesignated as a maintenance area. Would a change to allow the use of CMAQ
funds in newly redesignated areas constitute good public policy even if the State's remaining nonattainment areas
lose CMAQ funds as a result? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(9) Projects that are not expected to contribute to emission reductions prior to the scheduled attainment date under
the Clean Air Act are not eligible for CMAQ funds. Should any project which reduces emissions be eligible even if it
is scheduled for completion after the attainment date?

Should a project whose construction is not expected to start until after the attainment date be eligible?

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
(E) Project-Level Review 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The project-level review will focus on implementation of the CMAQ program in the 10 States with the worst ozone and
carbon monoxide pollution. These States receive the largest apportionments under the CMAQ program, almost two-thirds
of each year's total. The States and their share of apportionments are:

If time permits, the projects funded under the CMAQ program in one State in FHWA Regions 7, 8 and 10 will also be reviewed.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Each State will be visited by FHWA, FTA and EPA representatives to conduct interviews with Federal, State, and MPO
officials and other interested parties. A sample of each State's projects will be examined in detail in light of the
policy considerations above, the program guidance, and other factors as they arise. A representative sample will
be developed in keeping with standard review and statistical procedures. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Sources of information on the CMAQ program as a whole will also be consulted. Such sources will include the States'
annual reports on CMAQ program obligations, DOT fiscal and management reporting data, and reports on the program
from government and nongovernment agencies. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
To determine the CMAQ program's impact on greenhouse gases, information will be taken from the States' annual reports
on funded projects and other sources, and background information on carbon dioxide emissions from transportation
sources.

Site visits to the States mentioned above will be conducted in the spring and early summer of 1994. A final report providing
findings and recommendations will be released later in the year, with additions or changes to the program guidance
to follow, as necessary. The report will be available from the FHWA Office of Environment and Planning hotline at (202)

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
On February 28, 1994, the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative (USTR) published a Federal Register notice (59 FR
9503) announcing an affirmative determination under Section 1377 of the Omnibus Trade and Competitiveness Act of
1988 (19 U.S.C. 3106) that certain practices of Japan with respect to cellular telephone products and services were
not in compliance with Japan's commitments under a June 28, 1989 agreement on third party radio and cellular telecommunications
equipment. Following negotiations with Japan, the Governments of Japan and the United States reached an agreement
on March 12, 1994 that resolves U.S. concerns. On April 11, 1994, the Government of Japan forwarded to USTR the deployment
plan called for under the March 12 agreement. As a result, on April 11, 1994, the U.S. Trade Representative terminated
the affirmative determination under Section 1377.
