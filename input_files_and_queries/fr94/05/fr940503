(1) Would have an annual effect on the economy of less than $100 million; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Would not adversely affect in a material way the economy, a sector of the economy, productivity, competition,
jobs, the environment, public health or safety, or State, local, or tribal governments or communities; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Would not create a serious inconsistency or otherwise interfere with an action taken or planned by another agency;

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

Statutory Background 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This rule is issued pursuant to the provisions of the 1938 Act and the 1949 Act. Section 1108(c) of Public Law. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
99&hyph;272 provides that the determinations made in this rule are not subject to the provisions for public participation
in rulemaking contained in 5 U.S.C. 553 or in any directive of the Secretary. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On February 1, 1994, the Secretary announced the national marketing quota and price support level for the 1994 crop
of burley tobacco. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
Marketing Quota 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 319(c)(3)(A)(B) of the 1938 Act provides, in part, that the national marketing quota for a marketing year
for burley tobacco is the quantity of such tobacco that is not more than 103 percent nor less than 97 percent of the total
of: (1) The amount of burley tobacco that domestic manufacturers of cigarettes estimate they intend to purchase on
U.S. auction markets or from producers, (2) the average quantity exported annually from the U.S. during the three
marketing years immediately preceding the marketing year for which the determination is being made, and (3) the quantity,
if any, that the Secretary, in the Secretary's discretion, determines necessary to adjust loan stocks to the reserve
stock level. However, any downward adjustment in such loan inventories may not exceed the greater of 35 million pounds
or 50 percent of the amount which the loan inventories exceed the reserve stock level. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 319(c)(3)(C) further provides that, with respect to the 1990 through 1994 marketing years, any reduction
in the national marketing quota being determined shall not exceed 10 percent of the previous year's national marketing
quota. The reserve stock level is defined in section 301(b)(14)(D) of the 1938 Act as the greater of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
50 million pounds or 15 percent of the national marketing quota for burley tobacco for the marketing year immediately
preceding the marketing year for which the level is being determined. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 320A of the 1938 Act provides that all domestic manufacturers of cigarettes with more than 1 percent of U.S.
cigarette production and sales shall submit to the Secretary a statement of purchase intentions for the 1994 crop
of burley tobacco by January 15, 1994. Six such manufacturers were required to submit such a statement for the 1994
crop and the total of their intended purchases for the 1994 crop is 324.0 million pounds. The three-year average of
exports is 183.8 million pounds. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The national marketing quota for the 1993 crop year was 603.0 million pounds (58 FR 36857). Thus, in accordance with
section 301(b)(14)(D), the reserve stock level for use in determining the 1994 marketing quota for burley tobacco
is 90.5 million pounds.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On January 21, 1994, USDA projected that the loan coops would have in their inventories 420.5 million pounds of burley
tobacco (excluding pre-1985 stocks committed to be purchased by manufacturers and covered by deferred sales). Accordingly,
the adjustment to maintain loan stocks at the reserve supply level is a decrease of 165.0 million pounds. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The total of the three marketing quota components for the 1994&hyph;95 marketing year is 342.8 million pounds. However,
the 1994 national marketing quota cannot be less than 90 percent of 1993's quota. Accordingly, the national marketing
quota for the marketing year beginning 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
October 1, 1994, for burley tobacco is 542.7 million pounds. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In accordance with section 317(e) of the 1938 Act, the Secretary is authorized to establish a national reserve from
the national acreage allotment in an amount equivalent to not more than 1 percent of the national poundage quota for
the purpose of making corrections in farm acreage allotments, adjusting for inequities, and for establishing allotments
for new farms. The Secretary has determined that a national reserve for the 1994 crop of burley tobacco of 1,862,367
pounds is adequate for these purposes. In setting farm quotas for the 1994 burley crop, it was also determined based
on past practice that a factor of 0.90 would be used to adjust preliminary farm quotas to reach the national poundage
quota.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
Price Support 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Price support is required to be made available for each crop of a kind of tobacco for which quotas are in effect, or for
which marketing quotas have not been disapproved by producers, at a level determined in accordance with a formula
prescribed in section 106 of the 1949 Act. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
With respect to the 1994 crop of burley tobacco, the level of support is determined in accordance with sections 106(d)
and (f) of the 1949 Act. Section 106(f)(7)(A) of the 1949 Act provides that the level of support for the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1994 crop of burley tobacco shall be: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) The level, in cents per pound, at which the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1993 crop of burley tobacco was supported, plus or minus, respectively, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) An adjustment of not less than 65 percent nor more than 100 percent of the total, as determined by the Secretary after
taking into consideration the supply of the kind of tobacco involved in relation to demand, of: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(A) 66.7 percent of the amount by which: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(I) The average price received by producers for burley tobacco on the United States auction markets, as determined
by the Secretary, during the 5 marketing years immediately preceding the marketing year for which the determination
is being made, excluding the year in which the average price was the highest and the year in which the average price was
the lowest in such period, is greater or less than:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(II) The average price received by producers for burley tobacco on the United States auction markets, as determined
by the Secretary, during the 5 marketing years immediately preceding the marketing year prior to the marketing year
for which the determination is being made, excluding the year in which the average price was the highest and the year
in which the average price was the lowest in such period; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(B) 33.3 percent of the change, expressed as a cost per pound of tobacco, in the index of prices paid by the tobacco producers
from January 1 to December 31 of the calendar year immediately preceding the year in which the determination is made.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The difference between the two 5-year averages (i.e., the difference between (A) (I) and (II)) is 4.7 cents per pound.
The difference in the cost index from January 1 to December 31, 1993, is also 4.7 cents per pound. Applying these components
to the price support formula (4.7 cents per pound, two-thirds weight; 4.7 cents per pound, one-third weight) results
in a weighted total of 4.7 cents per pound. As indicated, section 106 provides that the Secretary may, on the basis of
supply and demand conditions, limit the change in the price support level to no less than 65 percent of that amount.
In order to remain competitive in foreign and domestic markets, the Secretary used his discretion to limit the increase
to 65 percent of the maximum allowable increase. Accordingly, the 1994 crop of burley tobacco will be supported at
171.4 cents per pound, 3.1 cents higher than in 1993.

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Office of Thrift Supervision (OTS) is amending its regulations governing mutual-to-stock conversions of insured
savings associations. The purpose of these amendments is to revise, clarify and update the current regulations to
strengthen the conversion standards and ensure the integrity of the conversion process. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The amendments revise and clarify the appraisal standards; prohibit the use of ``running'' proxies by management
of converting associations; place the current tax-qualified Employee Stock Ownership Plan (ESOP) stock purchase
priority after those of eligible depositors; provide stock purchase priority to long-term depositors; require
that a stock purchase preference be given to eligible depositors residing in the association's local community;
prohibit management stock benefit plans in a conversion; prohibit merger conversions except in supervisory situations;
lengthen the conversion public comment period; require associations to submit business plans for all conversions;
prohibit the repurchase of a converted association's stock within one year of conversion; and make publicly available
preliminary conversion proxy materials. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Interested parties are invited to submit written comments on the conversion regulations, both as to the amendments
adopted here and the issues on which comment is specifically solicited and as to any other current provisions of the
conversion regulations as they relate to this interim rule.

I. Introduction 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The OTS has broad authority to authorize and regulate mutual to stock conversions of savings associations under sections
5(i) and (p) of the Home Owners' Loan Act, as amended (HOLA), 12 U.S.C. 1464(i) and (p).
<FOOTCITE>1</FOOTCITE>
 For the past 20 years_since the OTS's predecessor, the Federal Home Loan Bank Board (FHLBB) instituted mutual to stock
conversion regulations in 1974
<FOOTCITE>2</FOOTCITE>
_mutual to stock conversions have been a successful vehicle for bringing new capital into the thrift industry. Since
1974, over 1,000 mutual savings associations have converted to the stock form of ownership, in the process raising
approximately $16 billion in new capital.

While mutual to stock conversions provide an opportunity for thrifts to raise capital, they may also provide an opportunity
for an association's insiders to engage in transactions that transfer to the insiders an inappropriate amount of
a converting association's value. Thus, the OTS mutual to stock conversion regulations reflect standards and safeguards
developed over the years to maintain the integrity of the conversion process, to ensure safety and soundness by responding
to the potential for abuses in thrift conversions and to allow the conversion process to function effectively as a
capital raising tool.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The OTS mutual to stock conversion regulations seek to balance concerns such as a fair opportunity for participation
by account holders and the desire to infuse significant amounts of new capital into converting savings associations.
In addition, the regulations are structured to assure that a savings association receives fair value for its conversion
stock and to prevent insider abuse by governing the manner and extent to which a savings association's insiders and
their associates, individually and in the aggregate, may acquire stock and other benefits in a conversion. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In recent months, mutual to stock conversions have become the subject of controversy and negative media attention.
In particular, there has been controversy over the fact that some states offer insiders of state savings banks the
opportunity to gain potentially greater benefits and more generous compensation packages than are currently permitted
under OTS rules. Congress also has expressed serious concerns in this area. Legislation has been introduced in both
the House and Senate to address the issue of minimum standards for conversions by state savings banks and limitations
on management benefits in conversions. In addition, both the Financial Institutions Subcommittee of the House Banking
Committee and the Senate Banking Committee recently have held hearings on perceived abuses in mutual to stock conversions.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Although the OTS believes that its current regulations have generally provided sound safeguards for mutual to stock
conversions, the OTS and the FHLBB, in administering the conversion program, have refined the conversion regulations
periodically in light of experience with the conversion process and in response to developments in the market place.
As a result of the recent events concerning mutual to stock conversions, the OTS has again reviewed its conversion
regulations to assess whether additional revisions to its rules are necessary. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As part of its review, the OTS has analyzed the changing financial condition of converting mutual associations. During
the 1980s, most mutual savings associations were marginally capitalized and many were insolvent. As a result, the
FHLBB undertook a number of regulatory initiatives designed to encourage associations to convert to stock form.
Many associations took advantage of these changes to recapitalize. Now, however, most mutual institutions in the
industry are healthy. Generally, these healthy institutions are not converting to meet regulatory capital requirements.
Instead, they seek to raise capital to expand their current operations through branching or acquiring other institutions,
to engage in new activities, through both the formation of a holding company and establishment or acquisition of operating
subsidiaries, and to establish stock benefit plans for management and employees. This change in the reasons for conversions
has caused the OTS to rethink the need for the regulatory inducements for conversion contained in the current regulations.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Based upon the foregoing, the OTS has identified several areas of the regulations, discussed below, that it has determined
to revise, update and clarify to further strengthen the standards governing the conversion process. The OTS has consulted
with the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (``FDIC'') in developing these changes to ensure consistent policy
in this area. The OTS also has determined to adopt the amendments immediately as an interim final rule to protect the
integrity of the conversion process. As such, the final rule is designed to assure the public that the conversion program
will continue to be fair and equitable. Also, Congress has made it clear that it expects both the OTS and the FDIC to act
promptly to assure that any abuses or potential abuses in the mutual to stock conversion area are addressed.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

A. Revision to the Appraisal Standards 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Pursuant to 12 CFR 563b.3(c)(1), a converting savings association is required to sell its capital stock at a total
price equal to its estimated 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
pro forma 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
market value, based on an independent valuation. When the FHLBB adopted the initial conversion regulations, it found
that underpricing conversion stock would result in ``windfall'' distributions of the value of a converting association
and that no method of conversion could be considered equitable unless the conversion stock was accurately appraised
and sold at its 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
pro forma 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
market value. This was necessary to assure that the association received full value for the conversion stock it distributed.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The current regulations contain safeguards designed to enhance the accuracy of conversion appraisals. Under 12
CFR 563b.7(f), the OTS requires that the appraisal be prepared by an appraiser who is independent of the converting
association and who has expertise in the area of corporate appraisals. Although the conversion regulations have
been amended numerous times since 1974, the requirement that the conversion stock be sold at its 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
pro forma 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
market value has remained constant. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The integrity of the conversion process rests, in large part, on the accuracy of the appraised value of the converting
association. It is for this reason that the OTS is concerned about recent conversions that have exhibited significant
increases in the immediate post-conversion trading market for the stock. Although some of these increases can be
explained by the high levels of speculation that have existed generally in the market for financial institution stocks,
the OTS is concerned that many of these appraisal reports may have set 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
pro forma 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
market values that were significantly below the true value of the converting associations. In such cases, the converting
association is harmed because the net proceeds from the conversion, and the association's capital levels, are lower
as a result of its stock being undervalued upon issuance. Conversely, insiders and other sophisticated investors
are able to accrue undeserved financial benefits. When this occurs, the independence and competence of the appraiser
are called into question. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The OTS relies on the independent appraiser to submit an appraisal report that is impartial, objective and arrived
at independently, without undue influence from the converting association or any of its other agents, including
its attorneys, accountants, underwriters or selling agents. The OTS is taking this opportunity to remind those persons
serving as conversion appraisers that the current regulations require that the conversion applicant submit information
demonstrating, to the satisfaction of the OTS, the independence and expertise of the appraiser.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 In those cases where there appears to be a consistent pattern of undervaluation on the part of an appraiser, it may be
difficult for the applicant or the appraiser to establish that the appraiser has acted independently and in a competent
manner. In more egregious cases, the OTS also may determine to censure, suspend or bar an appraiser from practicing
before the OTS under the OTS rules of practice, 12 CFR part 513.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Under the current rules, &sect;563b.7(f)(1)(ii) permits the appraisal report to contain a ``brief summary'' of
data that is sufficient to support the appraiser's conclusions as to the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
pro forma 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
market value of the converting association. Section 563b.7(f)(3), however, permits the OTS to request additional
information with respect to the pricing of the converting association's capital stock. In practice, the OTS, relying
on &sect;563b.7(f)(3), has required that a full appraisal report be submitted as part of the conversion application.
In that regard, the OTS and its predecessor, the FHLBB, have provided detailed policy guidance to the industry regarding
appropriate appraisal standards to be used in valuing conversion stock.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In order to eliminate any potential confusion in this area, the OTS is amending &sect;563b.7(f)(1)(ii) by deleting
suggestions that the appraisal report need only be a ``brief summary'' and specifying that a full appraisal report
is required. The revised language codifies the current practice of OTS staff requiring a more complete and detailed
description of the elements that make up an appraisal report and justification for the methodology employed. Because
a full appraisal will now be required under paragraph (f)(1)(ii), the reference to ``full appraisal'' in &sect;563b.7(f)(3)
is unnecessary and is deleted. The OTS expects that appraisals will continue to contain sufficient detail to support
the conclusions contained therein and that appraisers will deliberate carefully in the formation of an opinion to
arrive at a 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

Section 563.7(f) also has been revised to provide that in those instances where the initial appraisal report is deemed
to be materially deficient and/or substantially incomplete, the OTS may deem the entire conversion application
materially deficient and/or substantially incomplete, and in accordance with the OTS applications processing
rules, 12 CFR part 516, decline to further process the application. In such cases, the applicant will be required to
refile the conversion application, including a revised appraisal, as a new application and pay any applicable filing
fees. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under current &sect;563b.7(f)(2), the fact that a person is participating in effecting a sale of the conversion stock,
either as an underwriter or as a selling agent, does not preclude such person or an affiliate of such person from being
considered independent for purposes of preparing the appraisal for the conversion. Although the staff has not experienced
any problems to date where a conversion appraisal firm or its affiliate have participated in effecting the sale of
the conversion stock, the OTS believes that it is essential that conversion appraisals not be tainted in any manner
by a real or potential conflict in such an affiliate relationship that would cause the appraiser to not be independent
in his or her judgments. Thus, while no changes are being adopted at this time, the OTS is requesting public comment
as to whether it should amend &sect;563b.7(f)(2) to prohibit an appraiser or its affiliates from also serving as an
underwriter or selling agent. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Finally, in order to further enhance regulatory oversight in this area, the OTS intends to issue updated guidance
for conversion appraisers that will provide specific details on appraisal methodology and report content.

B. Prohibition on Use of ``Running'' Proxies 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 563b.5(d)(4), adopted in 1985, provides for management of a converting association to use previously obtained
proxies, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
i.e.,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 ``running'' proxies, from a voting member. Previously, the conversion rules prohibited the use of ``running'' proxies.
The requirement was changed in 1985 to reduce conversion costs for marginally capitalized savings associations.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 563b.5(d)(4), however, requires that each voting member be furnished a proxy statement on the special plan
of conversion meeting, and only allows for use of the ``running'' proxy in the event the voting member does not grant
a later-dated proxy to vote at the meeting called to consider the plan of conversion or attend such meeting and vote
in person. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Currently, as discussed in section I. above, most mutual associations in the thrift industry seeking to convert are
well-capitalized. Thus, the regulatory rationale for truncating the proxy solicitation and voting requirements
generally no longer exists. In addition, depositors in greater numbers recently have expressed increased interest
in the conversion plans of their associations. The OTS believes, based on its experiences in this area, that the current
ability to use ``running'' proxies has lessened the incentive of converting associations to actively solicit depositors
to consider and vote on conversions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Thus, the OTS has decided to revise &sect;563b.5(d)(4) to prohibit the use of ``running'' proxies. The OTS believes
the prohibition is the most effective manner in which to assure full participation of the association's membership
in the conversion process. The requirement to use a proxy specifically designed for the conversion will require thrift
management to more actively solicit its depositors to obtain their votes for conversion. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition, the last two paragraphs of Item 1 and Item 4(d) of the Form PS have been revised to conform with the revisions
discussed above. Finally, a sentence has been added to &sect;575.13(a)(4) of the mutual holding company regulations
to conform with this revision.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Under OTS rules, a conversion offering may involve as many as three phases: A subscription offering, a direct community
offering and an underwritten public offering. Only the subscription offering phase, which affords account holders
the opportunity to subscribe for stock on a priority basis, is required; if all of the stock is purchased in the subscription
phase, any other offering is unnecessary. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The conversion regulations protect the status of mutual account holders by establishing a detailed series of subscription
priorities for purchases of conversion stock. Currently, &sect;563b.3(c)(2) requires that first priority to purchase
the stock issued in the conversion, after certain tax-qualified ESOP purchases, discussed below, belongs to eligible
account holders, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
i.e.,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 depositors holding qualifying deposits at the savings association as of a date (eligibility record date) at least
ninety days prior to the date of adoption of the plan of conversion by the association's board of directors.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The regulations also provide that each eligible account holder must receive, without payment, nontransferable
subscription rights in an amount equal to the greater of the maximum purchase limitation established under the converting
association's plan of conversion, or certain formulas prescribed under the regulations.

In 1986, amendments to the conversion regulations were adopted to eliminate uncertainty on a variety of issues presented
by employee stock benefit plans and to enhance the ability of officers, directors and employees of a savings association
to acquire stock when the association converted, through various types of employee stock benefit vehicles.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Prior to the 1986 amendments, the first priority to purchase conversion stock had always been with eligible account
holders. The 1986 amendments, which granted a first priority purchase right to tax-qualified employee benefit plans,
were based on the FHLBB's belief that acquisition of an association's stock by such plans provided a means for officers
and employees of converting associations to acquire larger ownership stakes in their associations upon conversion
without undermining the basic equities of the conversion process.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 In addition, and perhaps more significantly, the FHLBB sought to afford undercapitalized mutual savings associations,
that feared hostile takeovers as a public company, a measure of anti-takeover protection through the opportunity
to place a significant block of conversion stock in friendly hands, and thus, encourage capital raising through conversion.

Section 563b.3(c)(23) currently provides an explicit top priority for tax-qualified employee stock benefit plans
that permits plans to purchase up to 10% of the total conversion stock offering ahead of eligible depositors. This
priority also is on a preferred basis; thus, in the event an offering is over-subscribed, the plans' stock purchases
will not be affected. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Although the OTS believes that it is still appropriate to provide management incentives and to encourage employee
stock ownership in the converted association, these interests have been overshadowed by other factors. Because
most mutual associations are now healthy, there is a need to balance the interests of management and employees against
those of account holders by providing long-term depositors at mutual savings associations the first opportunity
to buy conversion stock. The OTS is therefore amending &sect;563b.3(c)(23) to revise the stock purchase priorities
so as to place eligible account holders before the tax-qualified employee stock benefit plans and to place tax-qualified
employee stock benefit plans before supplemental eligible account holders
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
10
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 and all other voting members who have subscription rights. Finally, the OTS is amending &sect;563b.3 (c)(6)(i),
(c)(7), and (d)(4) to conform to these changes.

The term ``supplemental eligible account holder'' means any person holding a qualifying deposit, except officers,
directors and their associates, as of the last day of the calendar quarter preceding the OTS's approval of the application
for conversion. See current 12 CFR 563b.2 (a)(37) and (a)(38).

D. Revision to Eligibility Record Date 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As discussed above, the intent of the eligibility record date is to give long-term depositors a priority in purchasing
stock. It has been the OTS's experience, however, that converting associations have opted for the minimum 90-day
period for determining who is a long-term depositor. Upon review of this area, the OTS does not believe that use of the
minimum 90-day period is a meaningful indicator of long-term depositor status and should be substantially lengthened.
Thus, the OTS is amending the existing rule to require that the eligibility record date be set at a date no less than a
year prior to board of director approval of the plan of conversion. In so doing, the OTS stresses that the one year period
is a minimum time period; converting associations are encouraged to establish longer time periods to maximize the
stock purchase priority for long-term depositors. The OTS also is requesting public comment as to whether a longer
minimum time period would be appropriate.

E. Priority to Account Holders and Voting Members Residing in the Association's Local Community

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The current conversion regulations require that, following the subscription offering of conversion stock to account
holders, all nonsubscribed shares be sold either in a public offering or a direct community offering giving ``a preference
to natural persons residing in the counties in which the association has an office.''
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
11
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Thus, the regulations currently permit a converting association to conduct a community offering of conversion stock
in the local community, prior to a general public offering. The current regulations, however, do not permit converting
associations to give account holders and voting members in those local communities a priority to purchase stock in
the initial subscription offering. The OTS, has, however, on a case by case basis, recently permitted thrift subsidiaries
of mutual holding companies to prioritize stock purchases in this manner.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Upon consideration of its favorable experiences with local community stock priorities in stock offerings of thrift
subsidiaries of mutual holding companies, the OTS now believes it is appropriate to require converting associations
to give the local community a more meaningful opportunity to participate in all conversions on a priority basis at
the subscription offering stage. Accordingly, new &sect;563b.3 (c)(2)(i), (4)(i), and (5)(i) have been added to
extend this preference to the eligible account holder, supplemental eligible account holder and other voting member
priorities in the subscription stock offering. The preference in each priority group will be to those persons who
reside in the association's ``local community'' or within 100 miles of a home or branch office of the converting association.
The term ``local community'' is defined in new &sect;563b.2(a)(19) to include all counties in which the converting
association has a home or branch office, each county's standard metropolitan statistical area or the general metropolitan
area of each of these counties and such other similar local area(s) as provided for in the converting association's
plan of conversion, as approved by the OTS. Current &sect;563b.3(c)(2)(i)&hyph;(ii), 4(i)&hyph;(iv) and (5)(i)&hyph;(ii)
will be redesignated as &sect;563b.3(c)(2)(ii)&hyph;(iii), (4)(ii)&hyph;(v) and (5)(ii)&hyph;(iii). For purposes
of consistency, section 563b.3(c)(6)(iv) is revised to conform with new section 563b.3(c)(2)(i). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Additionally, 12 U.S.C. 1464(b) and 12 CFR 545.11(b) establish that a federally chartered savings association may
accept and maintain deposit accounts within its discretion and subject to criteria established by the association.
The OTS solicits public comment on whether a converting association should have the ability to prevent depositors
who do not reside in the local community from participating in a conversion. In addition, the OTS specifically solicits
comments as to whether an association, in anticipation of conversion, should be permitted to: (1) refuse to open accounts
for potential depositors residing outside the local community, and (2) close accounts of depositors residing outside
the local community.

Under &sect;563b.3(c)(8), the amount of stock that officers, directors and their associates can purchase, in the
aggregate, is limited to between 25% to 35% of the conversion stock, based upon the total asset size of the converting
association. In addition, existing &sect;563b.3(c)(6)(i) allows any one or more tax-qualified employee stock
benefit plans to purchase in the aggregate not more than 10% of the total offering of shares and allows such purchase
regardless of the number of shares to be purchased by other parties. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Current OTS policy also permits management stock benefit and recognition plans (collectively ``MRPs'') to purchase

Given that mutual savings associations currently seeking to convert generally are well-capitalized, the OTS has
become increasingly concerned that the association's management may be undertaking conversions for reasons other
than the need for capital. Some thrift insiders may be sacrificing the interests of their associations and mutual
account holders to acquire significant amounts of conversion stock and other benefits as cheaply as possible in the
conversion process. In addition, in some cases the issuance of conversion stock to a MRP lessens the opportunity for
depositors to obtain conversion stock. Finally, the issuance of stock options at the conversion price, rather than
at aftermarket trading prices, which in recent years has been substantially higher than the conversion price, creates
the impression that management is structuring an excessive compensation package. While the OTS believes there are
valid business reasons for thrifts to adopt MRPs and stock option plans in order to attract and retain qualified management,
these plans are now more appropriately implemented subsequent to the conversion and with shareholder approval.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The OTS is therefore substantially revising and codifying its policies regarding the establishment of MRPs and stock
option plans during the conversion process in new &sect;563b.3(g)(4). The new provisions require that any decision
to implement MRPs or stock option plans after conversion be voted on and approved by a majority of the shareholders
no earlier than the first annual meeting following the conversion. The rule further requires that thrift subsidiaries
of mutual holding companies obtain a vote of a majority of stockholders, other than the parent mutual holding company,
to approve such plans.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
14
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The provisions also prohibit the use of conversion stock to fund MRPs, require that MRPs be awarded and stock options
be granted only after shareholder approval is received and require that stock options be granted at the market price
at which the stock is trading at the time of grant. In addition, any intention by management to implement MRPs or stock
option plans within one year of conversion would be (1) required to be fully disclosed in the proxy soliciting and conversion
stock offering materials, and (2) subject to the prior approval of the appropriate OTS Regional Director. Finally,
the regulation codifies the OTS's current policies regarding permissible amounts that may be included in stock option
and MRP plans formed within one year of conversion. Codification of these policies is designed to provide clear guidance
in this area.

In this regard, &sect;10(o)(8)(B) of the HOLA requires that a mutual holding company, which is generally controlled
by the management of its thrift subsidiary, must own more than 50% of its thrift subsidiary. Thus, absent a disinterested
stockholder vote requirement, management will be able to ensure approval of its compensation plans.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Under &sect;563b.10, a mutual savings association may convert to stock form by merging with an existing stock association
or by becoming a subsidiary of an existing holding company. In this type of conversion, the account holders of the mutual
savings association, instead of being offered the opportunity to purchase stock of the converting mutual association,
are instead offered the opportunity to purchase shares of the acquiring stock association or holding company. The
structure of these transactions raises unique issues not involved in other types of conversions. These include the
adequacy of the consideration paid by an acquiror; whether a ``control premium'' should or can be incorporated into
the valuation of the mutual savings association; the treatment of the mutual account holders in connection with the
distribution of the acquiror's stock; whether mutual account holders should be able to purchase the acquiror's stock
at a discount and the amount of such discount; and the appropriateness of management compensation and stock incentive
packages offered by an acquiror to coax the mutual association's management into the merger conversion.

When merger conversions were first allowed by the FHLBB in the 1980s, they were perceived to be a useful supervisory
tool by which significantly undercapitalized or marginally capitalized savings associations could improve their
capital positions. In recent years, however, the OTS began to have increasing concern about merger conversions involving
healthy associations. In Thrift Bulletin 58 (April 19, 1993), the OTS established increased disclosure requirements
for merger conversion proxy statements to ensure that account holders received adequate and accurate disclosure
about proposed merger conversion transactions. In so doing, the OTS asserted its view that merger conversions provide
more opportunity than standard conversions for insider abuse.

In addition, there have been numerous complaints recently by account holders and others that permitting healthy
mutual savings associations to be acquired by means of a merger conversion has resulted in some thrift insiders putting
their self interest ahead of the interests of the converting association and its account holders. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As a result of these concerns, the OTS recently imposed a moratorium on healthy savings associations entering into
these transactions. In its announcement, the OTS stated that the moratorium would not prohibit the acquisition of
an undercapitalized thrift by a healthy acquiror. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In undertaking the moratorium, the OTS noted that in many cases, management of the converting mutual savings associations
engaging in merger conversions were receiving extremely generous compensation and benefit packages. While OTS
rules limit many forms of excessive compensation in merger conversions,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
17
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 there is still an issue as to whether management is opting for a merger conversion instead of a standard conversion
based on the best interests of the association and its depositors or in response to the level of benefits offered to
management by the acquiring entity. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

</FOOTNAME>
<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->
For example, the OTS policy statement on mergers, 12 CFR 571.5, in pertinent part, specifically provides that compensation,
including deferred compensation to officers, directors and controlling persons of a merging association may not
be in excess of that which is reasonable and commensurate with their duties and responsibilities. The rule provides
that mergers will be particularly scrutinized where any such persons will receive a material increase in compensation
above that paid by the merging association prior to the commencement of merger negotiations. In this regard, an increase
in compensation in excess of the greater of 15% or $10,000 gives rise to presumptions of unreasonableness and sale
of control. See 12 CFR 571.5(d)(3). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
</FOOTNOTE>

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In addition, merger conversions are perceived as being overly generous to the acquiring entities since they are essentially
able to acquire the mutual association at no cost. Unlike other corporate acquisitions, the acquiror pays nothing
for the converting association's stock. Rather, simultaneous with the acquisition, the acquiror's primary obligation
is to make an equity offering of its own stock to depositors of the converting association, retaining all proceeds
of the offering. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The OTS conversion regulations are based upon the principle that a conversion cannot be equitable unless the potential
for ``windfall'' gains is virtually eliminated. In a standard conversion, the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
pro forma 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
market value of the converting savings association is an appropriate means for determining the price of the stock
to be sold. In a merger conversion, however, the acquiring entity is obtaining control and should pay a premium for
the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
pro forma
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 value of the stock. In essence, the acquiring entity is obtaining control and receiving a ``windfall'' gain. As a result,
there is tremendous incentive for an acquirer to offer excessive benefits to the management of a mutual savings association
to participate in a merger conversion. Upon further review of this issue, the OTS has been unable to resolve the valuation
and ``windfall'' gains problem that the OTS currently believes is inherent in merger conversion transactions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The OTS therefore has concluded that in nonsupervisory cases, there should be a two step process. The account holders
at the mutual association should be given the opportunity to purchase stock in a mutual to stock conversion. This assures
the account holders that they will have the opportunity to more directly participate in any appreciation of the converting
association's stock price following the conversion. After the conversion to stock form, stockholders can vote on
whether to merge with another institution, subject to the rules governing post-conversion transactions.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Based on the reasons described above, the OTS has determined to amend its conversion regulations to limit merger conversions
to supervisory cases. As noted earlier, merger conversions may serve a useful purpose in those cases where a savings
association is unable to convert on a stand alone basis because of its weak financial condition. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
While eliminating the authority for nonsupervisory merger conversions in the interim final rule, the OTS is soliciting
comment as to whether merger conversions involving healthy savings associations should be permitted in the future,
and if so, under what circumstances. In particular, the OTS is interested in receiving comments on how merger conversions
could be structured to avoid the problems discussed above, including the problems associated with valuation issues.

H. Extension of the Conversion Public Comment Period
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 563b.4(b)(1) requires a conversion applicant to publish, in writing, a notice of the filing of an application.
Pursuant to the rule, written comments, including objections to the plan of conversion and materials supporting
the objections, from any member of the applicant or aggrieved person will be considered by the OTS if filed within ten
business days after the date of this notice. Failure to provide the written comments within the ten day period may preclude
the pursuit of any administrative or judicial remedies. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Depositors of converting associations and community groups have become increasingly interested in expressing
their views on proposed conversions, usually through the public comment process. In this regard, the current ten
day comment period may not be sufficient time for interested parties to review and comment on a detailed conversion
application. Thus, the OTS is revising &sect;563b.4(b)(1) to conform the public comment period in the conversion
regulations with the longer twenty calendar day public comment period provided under the acquisition of control
regulations.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
18
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The revision also would permit the OTS, in its discretion and upon written request, to extend the twenty day comment
period for an additional twenty days. The OTS believes that this revision will give interested parties a more meaningful
opportunity to express their views on a proposed conversion transaction. In so doing, the OTS does not believe this
requirement will impose an undue burden, since most converting associations undertake holding company conversions,

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
i.e., 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
where a holding company is being formed in the transaction, and are subject to the time periods under the acquisition
of control regulations.

The OTS conversion regulations do not require business plans in standard mutual to stock conversion transactions.
The OTS acquisition of control regulations, however, do require a consolidated business plan conforming to the requirements
set by the Regional Director to be included in holding company conversions.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

currently file a business plan.

The OTS believes that all converting associations should be required to demonstrate how they will prudently deploy
and utilize the conversion proceeds. Therefore, the exhibits portion of the conversion application form, Form AC,
is being amended to require a new Exhibit 8, a consolidated business plan subject to approval by the Regional Director.
Also, in response to the OTS's experience that a number of associations have recently submitted business plans that
do not adequately address the deployment of conversion proceeds, the new Exhibit 8 includes a requirement that each
converting association provide, as part of the business plan submitted with the application for conversion, a detailed
discussion of how the capital acquired in the conversion will be utilized. If the plan is to be treated confidentially,
the applicant should follow the procedures set forth at &sect;563b.4(c).

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The capital distributions regulation
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
20
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 and &sect;563b.3(g)(3) of the conversion regulations provide that a well capitalized converted association can
repurchase its capital stock, within certain limits and restrictions, by filing with the Regional Director an open-market
stock repurchase program for no more than 5% of the association's outstanding capital stock during a six month period.
This provision is in essence a safe harbor, provided an institution is well capitalized.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
21
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Section 563b.3(g)(3) also provides that OTS may object to proposed repurchases fitting within the safe harbor if
the repurchases would adversely affect the financial condition of the thrift.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
22
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Provided the safe harbor is met, a converted association can, under current rules, buy back up to 30% of the stock sold
in the conversion within three years of conversion.

The agency's experience has been that many associations begin substantial buyback programs immediately following
their conversions. While OTS believes that stock repurchase programs may serve valid business purposes, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
e.g
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
., maintaining the value of a converting institution's stock in an active trading market, the OTS has concerns that
substantial buyback programs begun immediately after conversion may not have a valid business purpose. In addition,
repurchases begun immediately after conversion raise substantial issues regarding whether conversion stock has
been appropriately valued.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
To address these concerns, Form AC has been revised to now require that each converting association provide, as part
of the business plan submitted with the application for conversion, a detailed discussion of how the capital acquired
in the conversion will be utilized, including, among other things, any proposed stock repurchases. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Also, the OTS is revising &sect;563b.3(g)(3) to prohibit stock repurchases for one year following conversion. After
one year, a recently converted association may file with the appropriate Regional Director an open-market repurchase
program in which it can request stock repurchases of no more than 5% of the outstanding capital stock during any twelve
month period within the following two years. In addition to the current standards governing permissible repurchases,
the Regional Director can now disapprove repurchases if the association does not demonstrate a valid business purpose
for the stock repurchase. The regulation, however, will permit the Regional Director to approve amounts greater
than 5% in the second and third years if there are circumstances that would justify such repurchases. Section 563b.3(g)(1)(iii)
has been deleted to conform with this revision. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The OTS also is soliciting comments as to whether the current requirements of the capital distributions regulations
governing the ``upstreaming'' of conversion proceeds to holding companies formed by converting institutions should
be revised to further restrict the upstreaming of substantial amounts of the conversion proceeds soon after the conversion.

1. Subscription Rights 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The conversion regulations require that prior to the completion of a conversion, no person may transfer, or enter
into any agreement or understanding to transfer, the legal or beneficial ownership of conversion subscription rights,
or the underlying securities to the account of another.

The OTS notes that the FDIC and others have recently suggested that it may be appropriate for depositors to be able to
transfer and sell their subscription rights so that any ``windfall'' value can be distributed directly to the depositors.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In this regard, the OTS believes that this type of change to the current conversion regulations would raise a number
of novel and complex legal and policy issues, many of which were taken into account previously by the FHLBB in determining
to prohibit transferability. These issues include the possibility of adverse federal tax consequences to depositors
receiving such rights, undue pressure on mutual associations to convert that may evolve from significant shifts
of savings funds by depositors into such associations, difficulties in equitably allocating such subscription
rights among depositors, potential manipulation of the process by sophisticated third parties to the detriment
of the depositors, incentives for manipulation by insiders, the continued need for establishment and maintenance
of a liquidation account,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
24
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 and significantly increased conversion costs due to compliance with securities laws requirements for registering
subscription rights for public distribution.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->
 The regulations require that a converting association establish and maintain a liquidation account for the benefit
of eligible account holders and supplemental eligible account holders in an amount equal to the association's net
worth at the date of conversion. Each eligible account holder is deemed to have a pro rata inchoate interest in the liquidation
account. In the event of a complete liquidation of the association, an account holder's interest may not be increased
after conversion, but may be reduced by any subsequent decrease in the account holder's savings account balance.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The OTS believes these issues must be carefully analyzed before considering regulatory changes in this area. Therefore,
the OTS is not proposing any change at this time that would allow for the transfer or sale of subscription rights, but
is requesting comment on whether subscription rights should continue to be nontransferable, or if transferability
is recommended, the reasons for, and the manner in which to allow for, such transfer.

2. Availability of Conversion Documents 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The conversion regulations, since adoption in 1974, have prohibited the placing of copies of preliminary conversion
stock offering and proxy soliciting materials in the OTS public files. The OTS has noted, over the past few years, an
increasing interest shown by account holders, the public and the media in the information contained in those portions
of an application for conversion. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The OTS believes that even though this information is preliminary in nature, it may be useful for account holders and
the public to access it earlier in the conversion process. The OTS, therefore, is revising &sect;563b.4(c) to eliminate
the automatic confidential treatment that has been afforded this information in the past. The revision will permit
the public to have ready access to all relevant materials regarding proposed conversion transactions.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
25
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Applicants will have the ability to request confidential treatment of any portion of these materials by following
the confidential treatment procedures contained in section 563b.4(c).

 This revision augments the amount of information regarding conversions currently required to be made public by converting
associations. Section 563b.4(a)(3)(i) requires that, promptly after adoption of a plan of conversion by its board
of directors, a converting association must notify its members, and make copies of the adopted plan of conversion
available for inspection by its members at each office of the savings association. Section 563b.4(a)(3)(ii) also
allows a converting association to issue a press release announcing the conversion.

Regulations and Other Technical Changes

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The mutual holding company regulations, 12 CFR part 575, generally incorporate the substantive and procedural standards
for conversion contained in the conversion regulations. To the extent the interim final rule addresses conversion
standards, those same standards apply to mutual holding company transactions. Thus, the OTS is also revising 12 CFR
part 575 to make clarifying and conforming changes to those regulations to reflect the changes being made to 12 CFR
part 563b. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

V. Executive Order 12866 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The OTS has determined that the interim final regulation does not constitute a ``significant regulatory action''
for purposes of E.O. 12866. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
VI. Administrative Procedure Act 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 553, OTS has found good cause to dispense with both prior notice and comment on this interim final
rule and with a 30-day delay of its effective date in light of the critical need to ensure an equitable conversion process
while still providing converting associations access to the capital markets. The OTS has a number of conversion applications
pending and it expects that it will receive significantly more in the next few weeks. Unless these revisions are implemented
immediately, associations will be able to avoid compliance with the new rules by filing and attempting to obtain approval
of their conversion applications before the new rules become effective. If the OTS were to proceed with a notice of
proposed rulemaking, the only practical solution to this problem would be to impose an administrative moratorium
on all conversions until the rulemaking process is complete. That type of rulemaking process would take a minimum
of several months. The result would thus be to preclude converting savings associations from raising additional
capital at a time when the capital markets are receptive to capital stock offerings by financial institutions. Should
the capital markets become less favorable, such a delay could prevent savings associations from raising sufficient
new capital through a mutual to stock conversion. The public interest is served by encouraging savings associations
to raise additional capital because an association's capital is the financial cushion that protects the association's
depositors and the federal fund that insures the depositors' accounts. In view of the need both to ensure an equitable
conversion process and to provide converting associations with access to the capital markets without delay, the
OTS finds that good cause exists for dispensing with the notice and comment procedures of the Administrative Procedure
Act. Similarly, the OTS finds that good cause exists for eliminating the 30-day delay of the effective date. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The revised rules will become effective upon publication in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 and will be applicable to all applications pending or newly filed as of that date. The OTS generally expects converting
associations with pending applications to comply with the revised rules. The OTS may grant, on a case by case basis,
a waiver in writing from any provision in the interim final rule for good cause shown. The request for a waiver must contain
sufficient information to substantiate the justification for the waiver. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The OTS, however, seeks public comment on the conversion regulations, both as to the amendments adopted here and the
issues on which comment is specifically solicited and as to any other current provisions of the conversion regulations
as they relate to this interim final rule. The OTS may modify the rule in response to those comments if appropriate.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) For management or employee stock benefit plans, the aggregate amount of such plans shall not exceed three percent

(vii) All such plans are approved by a majority of the association's stockholders, or in the case of a recently formed
holding company, its stockholders, prior to implementation and no earlier than the first annual meeting following
the conversion; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(viii) In the case of a savings association subsidiary of a mutual holding company, all such plans are approved by a
majority of stockholders other than its parent mutual holding company prior to implementation and no earlier than
the first annual meeting following the stock issuance; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ix) For stock option plans, stock options are granted at the market price at which the stock is trading at the time of
grant; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(x) For management or employee stock benefit plans, no conversion stock is used to fund the plans; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(xi) Prior to implementation, all such plans are submitted to the appropriate Regional Director for review and approval
in accordance with the foregoing standards. In connection with such review, the Regional Director shall consider
all relevant supervisory information, including, among other things, the association's capital level, operating
history and size of the association. The Regional Director may permit amounts greater than those specified in paragraph
(g)(4)(vi) of this section, provided that the aggregate limitations of paragraphs (g)(4)(ii)&hyph;(v) of this
section are not exceeded.

Director. The proposed plan of conversion and any comments will be available for inspection by any member of the applicant

(c) Should the applicant desire to submit any information it deems to be of a confidential nature regarding the answer
to any item or any part of any exhibit included in any application under this part, such information pertaining to such
item or exhibit shall be separately bound and labeled ``confidential,'' and a statement shall be submitted therewith
briefly setting forth the grounds on which such information should be treated as confidential. Only general reference
thereto need be made in that portion of the application which the applicant deems not to be confidential. Applications
under this part shall be made available for inspection by the public, except for portions which are bound and labeled
``confidential'' and which the Office determines to withhold from public availability under 5 U.S.C. 552 and part
505 of this chapter. Preliminary soliciting materials will be made available upon filing, unless such materials
are not otherwise available to the public and are bound and labeled ``confidential.'' The applicant will be advised
of any decision by the Office to make public information designated ``confidential'' by the applicant. Even though
sections of the application are considered ``confidential,'' as far as public inspection thereof is concerned,
to the extent it deems necessary, the Office may comment on such confidential submissions in any public statement
in connection with its decision on the application without prior notice to the applicant.

This action establishes Class E airspace at Belle Plaine, Iowa. The development of a new standard instrument approach
procedure (SIAP) at the Belle Plaine Municipal Airport, Belle Plaine, Iowa, utilizing the Cedar Rapids, Iowa, Very
High Frequency Omnidirectional Range Tactical Air Navigation (VORTAC) and the Belle Plaine non-directional beacon
(NDB) on the airport as a navigational aid has made this action necessary. Controlled airspace extending from 700
to 1200 feet above ground level (AGL) is needed for aircraft executing the approach. The area will be depicted on aeronautical
charts to provide a reference for pilots operating in the area.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
On January 21, 1994, the FAA proposed to amend part 71 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR part 71) to establish
Class E airspace at the Belle Plaine Municipal Airport, Belle Plaine, Iowa (59 FR 8566).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Interested parties were invited to participate in this rulemaking proceeding by submitting written comments on
the proposal to the FAA. No comments objecting to the proposal were received. We discovered there was a minor error
in the geographic coordinates of the Belle Plaine Municipal Airport. In addition, there was a reference to the Belle
Plaine, Iowa, NDB and Cedar Rapids, Iowa, VORTAC in the official description, which is not required. They were corrected
in this document. Other than these changes, this amendment is the same as that proposed in the notice. Class E airspace
designations for airspace areas extending upward from 700 feet or more above ground level are published in paragraph
6005 of FAA Order 7400.9A, dated June 17, 1993, and effective September 16, 1993, which is incorporated by reference
in 14 CFR 71.1 (58 FR 36298; July 6, 1993). The Class E airspace designation listed in this document will be published
subsequently in the Order.

The Rule
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This amendment to part 71 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR part 71) establishes Class E airspace at Belle
Plaine, Iowa, extending upward from 700 feet above the surface excluding that portion which overlies the Cedar Rapids,
Iowa, Class E airspace. The development of new SIAPs at Belle Plaine Municipal Airport has made this rule necessary.
The intended effect of this rule is to provide adequate Class E airspace for aircraft executing the NDB or VOR/DME&hyph;A
SIAPs at Belle Plaine Municipal Airport.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FAA has determined that this regulation only involves an established body of technical regulations for which
frequent and routine amendments are necessary to keep them operationally current. It, therefore_(1) is not a ``significant
regulatory action'' under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under DOT Regulatory Policies
and Procedures (44 CFR 11034; February 26, 1979); and (3) does not warrant preparation of a regulatory evaluation
as the anticipated impact is so minimal. Since this is a routine matter that will only affect air traffic procedures
and air navigation, it is certified that this rule will not have a significant impact on a substantial number of small
entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
On January 7, 1994, the FAA proposed to amend part 71 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR part 71) to amend the
Class D airspace at the Kansas City Richards-Gebaur Airport, Missouri (59 FR 4608). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Interested parties were invited to participate in this rulemaking proceeding by submitting written comments on
the proposal to the FAA. No comments objecting to the proposal were received. This amendment is the same as that proposed
in the notice. Class D airspace areas are published in paragraph 5000 of FAA Order 7400.9A, dated June 17, 1993, and
effective September 16, 1993, which is incorporated by reference in 14 CFR 71.1 (58 FR 36298; July 6, 1993). The Class
D airspace designation listed in this document will be published subsequently in the order.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=2 -->
The Rule 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
This amendment to part 71 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR part 71) amends the Class D airspace at the Kansas
City Richards-Gebaur Airport. On September 16, 1993, Airspace Reclassification discontinued the use of the term
``airport traffic area.'' Airspace designated from the surface for an airport where there is an operating control
tower is now Class D airspace. During the Airspace Reclassification project, the Hillside Airport at Stilwell, Kansas,
was to be excluded from the Richards-Gebaur Class D airspace. However, it was inadvertently not addressed in the official
description. Hillside is a public use airport which was established in 1956 and serves numerous non-radio aircraft,
as well as ultralight vehicles. Under the rules prior to September 16, 1993, an aircraft could land and take off at this
airport without contacting the Richards-Gebaur Tower. Under the present rules, an aircraft operating to/from the
Hillside Airport must contact this Tower. The intended effect of this rule is to provide access for aircraft utilizing
the Hillside Airport without the requirement to establish radio contact with the Richards-Gebaur Tower. The coordinates
for this airspace docket are based on North American Datum 83.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FAA has determined that this regulation only involves an established body of technical regulations for which
frequent and routine amendments are necessary to keep them operationally current. It, therefore: (1) Is not a ``significant
regulatory action'' under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under DOT Regulatory Policies

This action establishes Class E airspace at the Sullivan Regional Airport, Sullivan, Missouri. The development
of a standard instrument approach procedure (SIAP) at the Sullivan Regional Airport, Sullivan, Missouri, utilizing
a new nondirectional beacon (NDB) has made this action necessary. Controlled airspace extending from 700 to 1200
feet above ground level (AGL) is needed. For aircraft executing the approach. The area will be depicted on aeronautical
charts to provide a reference for pilots operating in the area.

History
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
On January 7, 1994, the FAA proposed to amend part 71 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR part 71) to establish
Class E airspace at the Sullivan Regional Airport, Sullivan, Missouri (59 FR 4611).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Interested parties were invited to participate in this rulemaking proceeding by submitting written comments on
the proposal to the FAA. No comments objecting to the proposal were received. This amendment is the same as the proposed
in the notice. Class E airspace designations for airspace areas extending upward from 700 feet or more above ground
level are published in paragraph 6005 of FAA Order 7400.9A, dated June 17, 1993, and effective September 16, 1993,
which is incorporated by reference in 14 CFR 71.1 (58 FR 36298; July 6, 1993). The Class E airspace designation listed
in this document will be published subsequently in the Order.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
The Rule
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This amendment to part 71 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR part 71) establishes Class E airspace at Sullivan,
Missouri, extending from 700 feet AGL to 1200 feet AGL. The development of a SIAP based on a new NDB located on the Sullivan
Regional Airport, Sullivan, Missouri, made this proposal necessary. The intended effect of this rule is to provide
adequate Class E airspace for aircraft executing the NDB SIAP at Sullivan Regional Airport.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FAA has determined that this regulation only involves an established body of technical regulations for which
frequent and routine amendments are necessary to keep them operationally current. It, therefore: (1) Is not a ``significant
rule'' under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under DOT Regulation Policies and Procedures
(44 FR 11034; February 26, 1979); and (3) does not warrant preparation of a regulatory evaluation as the anticipated
impact is so minimal. Since this is a routine matter that will only affect air traffic procedures and air navigation,
it is certified that this rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities
under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act.

This amendment establishes, amends, suspends, or revokes Standard Instrument Approach Procedures (SIAPs) for
operations at certain airports. These regulatory actions are needed because of the adoption of new or revised criteria,
or because of changes occurring in the National Airspace System, such as the commissioning of new navigational facilities,
addition of new obstacles, or changes in air traffic requirements. These changes are designed to provide safe and
efficient use of the navigable airspace and to promote safe flight operations under instrument flight rules at the
affected airports.

This amendment to part 97 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR part 97) establishes, amends, suspends, or revokes
Standard Instrument Approach Procedures (SIAPs). The complete regulatory description of each SIAP is contained
in official FAA form documents which are incorporated by reference in this amendment under 5 U.S.C. 552(a), 1 CFR part
51, and &sect;97.20 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (FAR). The applicable FAA Forms are identified as FAA Form
8260&hyph;5. Materials incorporated by reference are available for examination or purchase as stated above.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The large number of SIAPs, their complex nature, and the need for a special format make their verbatim publication
in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 expensive and impractical. Further, airmen do not use the regulatory text of the SIAPs, but refer to their graphic
depiction on charts printed by publishers of aeronautical materials. Thus, the advantages of incorporation by reference
are realized and publication of the complete description of each SIAP contained in FAA form documents is unnecessary.
The provisions of this amendment state the affected CFR (and FAR) sections, with the types and effective dates of the
SIAPs. This amendment also identifies the airport, its location, the procedure identification and the amendment
number. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This amendment to part 97 is effective upon publication of each separate SIAP as contained in the transmittal. The
SIAPs contained in this amendment are based on the criteria contained in the United States Standard for Terminal Instrument
Approach Procedures (TERPS). In developing these SIAPs, the TERPS criteria were applied to the conditions existing
or anticipated at the affected airports.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The FAA has determined through testing that current non-localizer type, non-precision instrument approaches developed
using the TERPS criteria can be flown by aircraft equipped with Global Positioning System (GPS) equipment. In consideration
of the above, the applicable Standard Instrument Approach Procedures (SIAPs) will be altered to include ``or GPS''
in the title without otherwise reviewing or modifying the procedure. Because of the close and immediate relationship
between these SIAPs and safety in air commerce, I find that notice and public procedure before adopting these SIAPs
are unnecessary, impracticable, and contrary to the public interest and, where applicable, that good cause exists
for making some SIAPs effective in less than 30 days.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FAA has determined that this regulation only involves an established body of technical regulations for which
frequent and routine amendments are necessary to keep them operationally current. It, therefore_(1) is not a ``significant
regulatory action'' under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under DOT Regulatory Policies
and Procedures (44 FR 11034; February 26, 1979); and (3) does not warrant preparation of a regulatory evaluation as
the anticipated impact is so minimal. For the same reason, the FAA certifies that this amendment will not have a significant
economic impact on a substantial number of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act.

The Director of the National Institute of Standards and Technology, United States Department of Commerce, is today
issuing a final rule making changes to regulations previously found at 15 CFR part 7 pertaining to the operation of
the National Voluntary Laboratory Accreditation Program (NVLAP). The NVLAP procedures are redesignated as part
285 of title 15 of the Code of Federal Regulations, and are revised to expand the procedures to include accreditation
of calibration laboratories; update the procedures for compatibility with conformity assurance and assessment
concepts; assure consistency with relevant International Organization for Standardization (ISO) documents (e.g.,
ISO Guides 25, 38, 43, 58, and 9000); and facilitate and promote acceptance of calibration and test results between
countries to avoid barriers to trade. Provisions in this regard will facilitate cooperation between laboratories
and other bodies to assist in the exchange of information and experience, harmonize standards and procedures, and
establish the basis for bi-lateral and multi-lateral agreements.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
The Director of the National Institute of Standards and Technology, (NIST) is today issuing a final rule making changes
to regulations previously found at 15 CFR Part 7 pertaining to the operation of the National Voluntary Laboratory
Accreditation Program (NVLAP). NVLAP provides an unbiased third party evaluation and recognition of laboratory
performance, as well as expert technical assistance to upgrade that performance, by accrediting calibration laboratories
and testing laboratories found competent to perform specific tests or calibrations.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 02 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Competence is defined as the ability of a laboratory to meet the NVLAP conditions set out in the NVLAP regulations and
to conform to the criteria in NVLAP publications for particular calibration and test methods. Specifically, NVLAP
accreditation indicates that a laboratory's quality system, staff, facilities and equipment, calibration protocols,
methods and procedures, records and reports have been evaluated and found to meet NVLAP criteria.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Accreditation is granted following successful completion of a process which includes submission of an application
and payment of fees by the laboratory, an on-site assessment, resolution of any deficiencies identified during the
on-site assessment, participation in proficiency testing, technical evaluation, and administrative review.
The accreditation is formalized through issuance of a Certificate of Accreditation and Scope of Accreditation and
is publicized by announcement in various government and private media. NVLAP accreditation does not imply any guarantee
or certification of laboratory performance or test/calibration data; it is solely a finding of laboratory competence.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
NVLAP accreditation is available to commercial laboratories, manufacturers' in-house laboratories, university
laboratories, and federal, state and local government laboratories. Foreign-based laboratories may also be accredited
if they meet the same requirements as domestic laboratories and pay any additional fees required for travel expenses.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
NVLAP is comprised of a series of laboratory accreditation programs (LAPs) which are established on the basis of requests
and demonstrated need. Each LAP includes specific calibration and/or test standards and related methods and protocols
assembled to satisfy the unique needs for accreditation in a field of testing, field of calibration, product or service.

Description of the Changes
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The NVLAP procedures are redesignated as part 285 of title 15 of the Code of Federal Regulations; expanded to include
accreditation of calibration laboratories; updated for compatibility with conformity assurance and assessment
concepts; made consistent with relevant International Organization for Standardization (ISO) documents (e.g.,
ISO Guides 25, 38, 43, 58, and 9000); revised to facilitate and promote acceptance of calibration and test results
between countries to avoid barriers to trade; and to eliminate references to the NVLAP advisory committee. Section
D has been replaced with language essentially identical to ISO Guide 25. Provisions in this regard will facilitate
cooperation between laboratories and other bodies to assist in the exchange of information and experience, harmonize
standards and procedures, and establish the basis for bi-lateral and multi-lateral agreements.

Summary of Comments
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
On July 27, 1993, the National Institute of Standards and Technology published a notice of proposed rulemaking in
the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (58 FR 40087). A total of 11 letters were received: Four trade associations, three manufacturers, one government
agency, one laboratory accrediting organization, one testing laboratory, and one consultant commented. All eleven
supported the proposal, especially the changes in procedures that will result in achieving compatibility with international
standards and guides and broadening the scope of NVLAP to include accreditation of calibration laboratories.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Other than recommendations to strengthen the national and international recognition of NVLAP accredited laboratory
data, the comments covered a wide range of suggestions made by only one or two of the respondents. Recommendations
are addressed below with a summary ``Recommendation'' and a ``Response'' for each.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Comment. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
One accreditation organization and one consultant suggested that NVLAP clarify &sect;285.24 Denying, Suspending,
and revoking accreditation, to specify the conditions for making a suspension decision vis-a-vis a revocation decision.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 285.24 (e) clearly states that invoking suspension or revocation ``will depend on the nature of the violation(s)''.
It is very difficult to be prescriptive because of the vast possible combinations of laboratory operations and deficiencies.
Selecting suspension action implies the expectation that deficiencies can be resolved before actual suspension
is invoked; additionally, if suspension is invoked, the expectation is that it will be rather short lived. Revocation,
in contrast, is clearly used in cases of more serious deficiencies that are not likely to be resolved. The return of
the Certificate and Scope of Accreditation are required under revocation; it is expected that suspension will be
short lived, therefore return of the Certificate and Scope are not required.

Comment. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
One manufacturer and one laboratory suggested that NVLAP procedures should provide for an ``office of government
liaison'' to work toward reduction of redundant accreditation programs in the United States to save laboratories
the expense of paying for multiple programs.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Although redundant programs and multiple audits cause confusion and added expense to accredited laboratories,
NVLAP has no authority to add a provision regarding redundant programs and/or multiple audits. The NVLAP process
is designed so that NVLAP itself does not offer a LAP that duplicates one that exists or could be offered by a public sector
accreditor.

Comment. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
One consultant suggested that although a definition is provided for the term ``Certificate of Accreditation'',
a definition is needed for the term ``Certificate'' as used in the definition of ``Reference material''.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
See NIST Special Publication 260, ``Standard Reference Materials Catalog'', for definition and discussion of the
term ``certificate'' as it applies to Standard Reference Materials. Defining the term in the NVLAP procedures would
be confusing and out of context with its use.

One manufacturer suggested that part 285 should be referenced in &sect;285.6 NVLAP documentation.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 285.6 (a) will be changed to include such a reference.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Comment. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
One trade association suggested that NVLAP modify the definition for Authorized Representative in &sect;285.5
Definitions to provide an organization with more flexibility in naming an Authorized Representative.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This section will be reworded to provide additional flexibility by stating that the Authorized Representative of
an accredited laboratory may be an individual who is authorized by the laboratory or the parent organization.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Comment. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
One manufacturer suggested adding a definition for Competent to &sect;285.5 Definitions.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The definition of Competence will be added as ``the ability of a laboratory to meet the NVLAP conditions and to conform
to the criteria in NVLAP publications for specific calibration and test methods''.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

Comment. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
One manufacturer suggested modifying the definition of NVLAP in &sect;285.5 Definitions to include its relationship
to NIST.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Agree. The definition for NVLAP will be changed to state that NVLAP ``is an Office within the National Institute of
Standards and Technology''.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Comment. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
One trade association suggested changing the definition of Traceability of the accuracy_in &sect;285.5 Definitions
by changing ``primary'' standard to ``reference'' standard.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The definition is correct as written. Traceability follows a path which may include the ``reference standard'' in
the laboratory but, as the definition states, must be traceable ``ultimately to a primary standard''.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Comment. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
One trade association suggested that &sect;285.33 (k) Certificates and reports identify the type of laboratory
issuing the certificate and report (e.g., independent, manufacturer's, etc.). It is the belief of the writer of this
comment that ``in-house'' laboratories can not necessary produce ``unbiased'' results.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
No change is needed. Information describing the type of laboratory accredited is provided by the laboratory in its
application and included in the NVLAP data base. However, the type of laboratory has no bearing on the accreditation
decision; rather, the accreditation decision is based on the judgment (using results from on-site assessments,
proficiency testing, and monitoring visits) that the laboratory meets all of the criteria established for a particular
Laboratory Accreditation Program (LAP), independent of the ``organizational'' association of the laboratory.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 One consultant suggested revision of &sect;285.23(a) Granting and renewing accreditation to remove decisions
based on variations of compliance.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Full compliance results in accreditation action. Less than full compliance can result in accreditation or other
actions depending on variation from full compliance in terms of deficiencies and the expectations of corrective
action.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Comment:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 One consultant suggested that &sect;285.23(b)(3) Granting and renewing accreditation should contain a stronger
statement than ``reminding'' laboratories of their legal obligations.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 NVLAP has no responsibility or authority to do more than remind laboratories of this fact.

Comment:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 One trade association and one laboratory suggested that &sect;&sect;285.32(a)(10) and 285.33(b)(2)(ii) and (iii)
be either deleted or limited to ensure that the requirement for laboratories to avoid undue or coercive commercial
or financial pressures on staff are not applied to the normal course of employer-employee and independent contractor
relationships of a manufacturer's in-house laboratory.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 These Sections clearly avoid undue interference by limiting the requirement to ``pressures which might adversely
affect the quality of the work.'' Accreditation of a laboratory depends on NVLAP's confidence that the laboratory
will provide accurate test and calibration services. These services must no be degraded by pressures of any kind.
NVLAP cannot deal with degrees or types of pressure, only with the accuracy of data provided to customers.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 One trade association suggested that NVLAP needs to clarify its policy for addressing the recognition of foreign-based
laboratories based on accreditation by a foreign government or accrediting organization.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The policy will be clarified by adding to &sect;285.11 Requesting a LAP a new paragraph (f) which states that ``consistent
with applicable laws and regulations, the Director may negotiate and conclude agreements with the governments of
other countries for NVLAP recognition of foreign laboratories. At a minimum, any agreement must provide that accredited
foreign laboratories meet conditions for accreditation comparable to and consistent with those set out in these
requirements''.

 NVLAP must get this information prior to the laboratory making any changes. The fact of moving or reconfiguration
of a laboratory could significantly affect the quality of its testing or calibration activities.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 NVLAP accreditation does not limit the freedom of laboratories to offer services outside the scope of accreditation.
NVLAP only limits laboratories from claiming accreditation for services not included on their Scopes of Accreditation
issued to the laboratories.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 One trade association asked that the regulation be made more specific in defining the meaning of ``staffing'' in &sect;285.26.,
stating that it is too broad.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 NVLAP believes that there are so many possibilities regarding staffing changes that the reference needs to be general
so that an objective opinion can be made on the specific change proposed or made. NVLAP focuses on staffing changes
that could affect the quality of the testing or calibration work.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 One trade association suggested changing &sect;285.33 (1) Subcontracting of calibration or testing to limit subcontracting
to accredited laboratories only.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 This section is in full conformity with international requirements which do not impose such a restriction. This is
partly based on the fact that no other accredited laboratory may be geographically available or willing to provide
the services needed. NVLAP believes that its procedures for subcontracting will ensure that the data provided by
the subcontractor will meet the established quality standards.

A trade association, a Government agency and an accreditation organization commented that &sect;285.12(b)(3)
LAP development decision does not adequately prevent a conflict of interest for NIST in making LAP development decisions
that could be in competition with private sector accreditation programs.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The conditions under which NVLAP establishes and operates accreditation programs is explicit and addresses the
conflict of interest question. NVLAP believes that the requirements followed in making a development decision are
adequate and that NVLAP has guarded against establishment of programs already existing or that could be offered by
private sector accreditors.

A trade association, a Government agency and an accreditation organization commented that &sect;285.18 Adding
to or modifying an established LAP should be strengthened to require NVLAP to follow the same requirements for modifying
a LAP as for establishing a new LAP. NVLAP should not add test methods without going through a full ``need'' analysis.

Every LAP is established after an exhaustive process that includes the determination of need. Changes needed by a
LAP sponsor, caused by standards updated by standards bodies, or due to revisions in regulatory requirements, must
be made expeditiously so that the accreditation program continues to meet the needs of its sponsor.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
One manufacturer and one government agency suggested that &sect;285.13 Request from a government agency be revised
to contain all of the information required from a private sector organization requesting a LAP (&sect;285.14). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The procedures to be followed by private sector organizations and government agencies are, of necessity, different.
Regulatory and public service program authorities are specified in laws and administrative procedures. Accreditation
requirements established by government agencies may contain the conditions noted in &sect;285.14 and are automatically
referenced in the specific authority establishing a laboratory accreditation program.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
NVLAP, however, agrees that the procedures do need to explicitly address establishing or modifying NVLAP LAPs to
meet the requirements mandated by the Federal Government including legislative action and/or intergovernmental
understandings or agreements. Accordingly, section 285.1 is revised to state that NVLAP will operate to accredit
both calibration laboratories and testing laboratories ``in response to (a) Mandates by the Federal government
through legislative or administrative action; (b) Requests from a government agency (&sect;285.13); and (c) Requests
from a private section organization (&sect;285.14)''.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition, &sect;285.11, Requesting a LAP, is revised to provide that following receipt of the identification
of a mandate for a LAP based on legislative or administrative action, the Director must publish a Federal Register
notice (1) stating the purpose of the LAP including the national or international need; (2) describing the general
scope of the LAP; (3) identifying government agencies having oversight; and (4) providing information to any interested
party wishing to be on the NVLAP mailing list to receive routine information on the development of the LAP. In addition,
&sect;285.12 is revised to provide that the Director of NIST shall establish all LAPs on the basis of need; and that
a mandate to develop a LAP by NVLAP will be interpreted as a defacto decision to develop the specified LAP, and a LAP will
be developed (or existing LAPs modified, if practical) following these procedures.

Comment. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In the context of the establishment of LAPs at the request of Government agencies, one manufacturer stated that the
proposed change to the NVLAP procedures does not cover: (1) Requirements for factory inspections as a part of certification;
(2) certification organizations; and (3) the need for a public review of the findings. Further, the changes would
allow the use of subcontractors who are not independent of manufacturers, employers, and distributors.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
No changes are made. The comments reflect some of the conditions of accreditation required by a government agency.
These kinds of conditions are normally addressed in gathering information leading to a decision whether or not to
develop a new LAP. The NVLAP procedures can not be complete in anticipation of any and all possible conditions required
by a sponsor.

Comment.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Three trade associations, two manufacturers, a Government agency, an accreditation organization and a consultant
each commented on the need for more specifics regarding international trade, international recognition of testing
and calibration data, and memoranda of understanding (MOUs) and mutual recognition agreements. Most letters contained
some reference to these issues, either pointing out the need for explicit language recognizing international trade
interests such as ``reduction of non-tariff barriers''; working to ``make the program more acceptable nationally
and internationally''; stating that ``it is of great interest to U.S. manufacturers to have U.S./EC recognized accreditation
for testing to European specifications''; and identifying the need to ``promote the acceptance of calibration and
testing results between countries to encourage international trade''.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The comment was also made that the NVLAP revision should state that inquiries from other countries regarding memoranda
of understandings (MOUs) and mutual recognition agreements (MRAs) will be referred to the appropriate U.S. agency
to participate in any detailed negotiations.

 One consultant suggested changing &sect;285.22 Assessing and evaluating a laboratory to eliminate the suggestion
that NVLAP provides consulting or legal services. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

Response.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Regarding consulting services, communications with laboratories are in the context of these procedures, none of
which provide for consulting services. NVLAP identifies the deficiencies noted; it is the responsibility of the
laboratory, not NVLAP, to determine how deficiencies will be rectified. Regarding legal services, NVLAP provides
guidance to the accredited laboratories on the conditions for referencing accredited status; this is procedural,
not legal advice.

 The language in this section clearly defines the goals and objectives of NVLAP. Methods for achieving these goals
and objectives are already contained in many other publications, including NIST administrative procedures and
various NVLAP programmatic documents.

in response to comments received as a result of the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

that such changes should be compiled for use in discussions at upcoming ISO meetings related to changing ISO Guide
25.

Comment.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 One accreditation organization suggested that ASTM Standard E 1301 should be referenced instead of ISO Guide 38,
which is ``no longer a viable standard''; ISO Guide 43 should not be referenced because it is very general and being
revised.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Guides 38 and 43 served as reference to ensure that the NVLAP procedures meet all current international requirements.
In fact, the NVLAP procedures are more robust than the procedures contained in either Guide 38 or Guide 43. NVLAP is
committed to meeting international requirements for laboratory accreditation, therefore we reference the ISO
guides and standards. We also know that ISO ``equivalents'' are published by other standards bodies. However, we
do not plan to invest time in evaluating the equivalence of these standards in order to reference them in our procedures.

Comment.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 One accreditation organization suggested that the reference to ISO Series 9000 documents in &sect;285.4 References
might imply that NVLAP accreditation also conveys ISO 9000 registration.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Reference to the ISO Series 9000 does not imply that NVLAP is an ISO 9000 registrar. However, NVLAP accepts the statement
in ISO Guide 25 that ``laboratories meeting the requirements of the Guide comply with the relevant requirements of
the ISO 9000 series of standards including those of the model described in ISO 9002''.

The General Counsel of the Department of Commerce has certified to the Chief Counsel for Advocacy of the Small Business
Administration that this rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities
because (1) participation in NVLAP is entirely voluntary, and (2) the changes are primarily administrative, affecting
the management of the program rather than laboratories seeking or holding accreditation. Further, the technical
components of NVLAP, that is, the specific technical criteria that individual laboratories are accredited against,
are not changed in any significant way by this proposal.

Description and goal of NVLAP.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
(a) NVLAP is a system for accrediting calibration laboratories and testing laboratories found competent to perform
specific tests or calibrations. Competence is defined as the ability of a laboratory to meet the NVLAP conditions
(&sect;285.32) and to conform to the criteria (&sect;285.33) in NVLAP publications for specific calibration and
test methods.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) NVLAP is a process which:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Provides the technical and administrative mechanisms for national and international recognition for competent
laboratories based on a comprehensive procedure for promoting confidence in calibration and testing laboratories
that show that they operate in accordance with NVLAPs requirements;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Provides laboratory management with documentation for use in the development and implementation of their quality
systems;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Identifies competent laboratories for use by regulatory agencies, purchasing authorities, and product certification
systems;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) Provides laboratories with guidance from technical experts to aid them in reaching a higher level of performance
resulting in the generation of improved engineering and product information; and
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5) Promotes the acceptance of calibration and test results between countries, and facilitates cooperation between
laboratories and other bodies to assist in the exchange of information and experience, facilitating removal of non-tariff
barriers to trade and promoting the harmonization of standards and procedures.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
(c) NVLAP is comprised of a series of laboratory accreditation programs (LAPs) which are established on the basis
of requests and demonstrated need. The specific calibration and test methods, types of calibration and test methods,
products, services, or standards to be included in a LAP are determined by an open process during the establishment
of the LAP (see &sect;285.11). The Director of the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) does not
unilaterally propose or decide the scope of a LAP. Communication with other laboratory accreditation systems is
fostered to encourage development of common criteria and approaches to accreditation and to promote the domestic,
foreign, and international acceptance of test data produced by the accredited laboratories.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 This rule is a technical amendment to the Section 8 Housing Assistance Payments programs governed by 24 CFR parts 880
(New Construction), 881 (Substantial Rehabilitation), and 883 (State Housing Agencies). The amendment will conform
the special rent adjustment regulations for those programs (&sect;&sect;880.609(b), 881.609(b) and 883.710(b))
to the language used in section 8(c)(2)(B), by adding the phrase ``or similar costs'' to the list of substantial increases
in expenses, such as real property taxes and utility rates, that may result in the need for special rent adjustments.
The ``similar costs'' language appears in other section 8 program regulations (parts 882, 884 and 886), but was never
included in the regulations for those programs covered by parts 880, 881, and 883. This final rule will treat all section
8 programs comparably.

In accordance with its own regulations on rulemaking in 24 CFR part 10, the Department generally publishes a rule for
public comment before issuing a rule for effect, unless to do so would be impracticable, unnecessary, or contrary
to the public interest. This rule is being published as a final rule for effect because the Department believes that
public comment is unnecessary. The amendments made by this rule are technical in nature, and conform the regulations
to the statutory language.

Other Matters

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
An environmental assessment is unnecessary, since fair market rent schedules is categorically excluded from the
Department's National Environmental Policy Act procedures under 24 CFR 50.20(
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
l
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

This rule was not listed in the Department's Semiannual Agenda of Regulations published on April 25, 1994 (59 FR 20424)
in accordance with Executive Order 12866 and the Regulatory Flexibility Act.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In accordance with 5 U.S.C. 605(b) (the Regulatory Flexibility Act), the undersigned hereby certifies that this
rule does not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. Any economic impact, whether
on small entities or large, would be beneficial, in that it would seek to compensate property owners for extraordinary
expenses incurred that are not compensated by the annual rent adjustments.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The General Counsel, as the Designated Official under section 6(a) of Executive Order 12612, Federalism, has determined
that the policies contained in this rule will not have substantial direct effects on States or their political subdivisions,
or the relationship between the Federal government and the States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities
among the various levels of government. As a result, the rule is not subject to review under the Order. Specifically,
the requirements of this rule are directed to private owners of Section 8 projects and do not impinge upon the relationship
between the Federal government and State and local governments.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The General Counsel, as the Designated Official under Executive Order 12606, The Family, has determined that this
rule does not have potential for significant impact on family formation, maintenance, and general well-being, and,
thus, is not subject to review under the Order. Nothing in this rule changes the amount of rent paid by tenant families,
which is based on the income of the family.

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Department of the Navy is amending its certifications and exemptions under the International Regulations for
Preventing Collisions at Sea, 1972 (72 COLREGS), to reflect that the Judge Advocate General of the Navy has determined
that USS SIROCCO (PC 6) is a vessel of the Navy which, due to its special construction and purpose, cannot comply fully
with certain provisions of the 72 COLREGS without interfering with its special functions as a naval patrol craft.
The intended effect of this rule is to warn mariners in waters where 72 COLREGS apply.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 Pursuant to the authority granted in 33 U.S.C. 1605, the Department of the Navy amends 32 CFR part 706. This amendment
provides notice that the Judge Advocate General of the Navy, under authority delegated by the Secretary of the Navy,
has certified that USS SIROCCO (PC 6) is a vessel of the Navy which, due to its special construction and purpose, cannot
comply fully with 72 COLREGS, Rule 23(a)(ii), pertaining to display of a masthead light and a second (after) masthead
light on vessels exceeding 50 meters in length; Annex I, paragraph 2(k), pertaining to the vertical distance between
the forward and after anchor lights and the height of the forward anchor light above the hull; Rule 21(c), pertaining
to location of the sternlight, without interfering with its special functions as a naval patrol craft. The Judge Advocate
General of the Navy has also certified that the number of masthead lights displayed and the location of the other mentioned
lights are in closest possible compliance with the applicable 72 COLREGS requirements. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Moreover, it has been determined, in accordance with 32 CFR parts 296 and 701, that publication of this amendment for
public comment prior to adoption is impracticable, unnecessary, and contrary to public interest since it is based
on technical findings that the number and placement of lights on USS SIROCCO (PC 6) in a manner differently from that
prescribed herein will adversely affect the vessel's ability to perform its military functions.

This interim rule amends the Postal Service regulation which prohibits the disclosure to the public of information
contained in Postal Service Form 1583, ``Application for Delivery of Mail Through Agent.'' The amendment will authorize
the disclosure of information from Form 1583 for the purpose of identifying addresses as Commercial Mail Receiving
Agencies. The intended affect of this amendment is to provide an effective tool in combating credit card fraud and
other types of consumer fraud.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
Commercial Mail Receiving Agencies (CMRAs) are private entities which receive mail on behalf of other persons. Both
CMRAs and their customers are required to sign Postal Service Form 1583, ``Application for Delivery of Mail Through
Agent,'' a copy of which is filed with the postmaster responsible for the delivery address. Under 39 CFR 265.6(d)(10),
the disclosure to the public of any information contained in Form 1583 has been prohibited.

The Postal Service, primarily through its law enforcement branch, the Postal Inspection Service, has been working
with the credit card industry to prevent credit card fraud. One form of credit card fraud consists of submitting an
application for a credit card under a fictitious name. Perpetrators of this type of fraud may use an address provided
by a CMRA, which often appears to be a typical residential or business address, as a means of avoiding detection. Credit
card companies have asked the Postal Service to help them detect such fraud by identifying CMRA addresses, and the
Postal Service has concluded that the identification of CMRA addresses would be an effective tool in combating credit
card fraud and other types of consumer fraud.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As amended by the interim rule, 39 CFR 265.6(d)(8) will authorize disclosure of information only for the purpose of
identifying an address as belonging to a CMRA, and no other information concerning CMRAs or their customers will be
disclosed pursuant to the regulation. Because the regulation will not authorize the disclosure of the identities
of CMRA customers, disclosures under the regulation will not invade the legitimate privacy interests of persons
who receive mail through CMRAs. The information will be disclosed primarily by means of annotations to the Postal
Service's Delivery Sequence File (DSF). DSF data, the use of which is made available to the public through authorized
licensees, contains delivery-point addresses, and it does not include the identities of individuals.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Copies of Form 1583 on file with the Postal Service are records protected by the Privacy Act of 1974, 5 U.S.C. 552a, and
they are maintained in the Postal Service's Privacy Act system of records USPS 010.050, Collection and Delivery Records_Delivery

, the Postal Service is adding a routine use to system of records USPS 010.050 which will authorize the disclosure of
the information that may be released pursuant to the interim rule.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Although the Postal Service is exempted by 39 U.S.C. 410(a) from the advance notice requirements of the Administrative
Procedure Act regarding rulemaking (5 U.S.C. 553), the Postal Service invites interested persons to submit written
comments concerning the interim rule. These comments will be considered before a final rule is adopted.

I. Background
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
On November 12, 1992, the Commonwealth of Virginia's Department of Environmental Quality (VDEQ) submitted a request
to EPA to redesignate the Richmond moderate ozone nonattainment area from nonattainment to attainment, and to approve
a maintenance plan for the Richmond area as a State Implementation Plan (SIP) revision.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On August 17, 1993, (59 FR 43609), EPA published a notice of proposed rulemaking (NPR) proposing approval of the Commonwealth's
request to redesignate the Richmond moderate ozone nonattainment area to attainment and its associated maintenance
plan SIP revision. EPA's rationale for its proposed approval was stated in that NPR and will not be restated here. However,
on January 31, 1994, (59 FR 4263) EPA published a NPR withdrawing its August 17, 1993 proposed approval and proposing
to disapprove the request to redesignate the Richmond ozone nonattainment area from moderate nonattainment to attainment
and proposed to disapprove the maintenance plan as a SIP revision. EPA converted its proposed approval action to a
proposed disapproval because review of the 1993 ambient air quality data monitored during the 1993 ozone season indicated
that the Charles City County monitor, located in the Richmond nonattainment area, had registered a violation of the
ozone national ambient air quality standards (NAAQS). The ambient data was quality assured in accordance with established
procedures for validating such monitoring data. The VDEQ did not contest the registered data. Therefore, the Richmond
area does not meet the statutory criteria for redesignation to attainment found in section 107(d)(3)(E) of the CAA.
The maintenance plan SIP revision is not approvable because its demonstration of attainment and maintenance of the
ozone NAAQS is based on a level of ambient ozone precursor emissions which was thought to represent an inventory of
emissions that would provide for attainment and maintenance of the NAAQS, but which does not as evidenced by the ozone
violations recorded during the 1993 ozone season.

II. Comments Received on EPA's January 31, 1994 Proposal

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Letters of Public Comment:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 EPA received four comment letters concerning the January 31, 1994 action proposing to disapprove the request to redesignate
the Richmond ozone nonattainment area from moderate nonattainment to attainment and proposing to disapprove the
maintenance plan as a revision to the SIP. One comment letter supported EPA's proposal to disapprove both the request
to redesignate the Richmond ozone nonattainment area and to disapprove the maintenance plan SIP revision. Three
comment letters opposed EPA's proposed disapproval of the request to redesignate the Richmond area. The commenters
opposing EPA's proposed disapproval stated that that even though exceedances of the ozone standard had been registered
at the Charles City County monitor, the monitor is located in a rural location downwind of a more populated urban area.
The commenters stated that, based on meteorological data, the recorded violations were caused by a small portion
of the urban portion of the Richmond nonattainment area and are localized. The commenters stated that the rest of the
Richmond ozone nonattainment area should not be economically penalized by the disapproval of the Richmond redesignation
request. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
EPA's Response:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 EPA's response to the latter comments is that EPA has determined that ozone is a regional pollutant driven by several
factors including, but not restricted to, weather and climate changes and ozone precursors so that the effect of ozone
emissions are not localized. In light of this, and the lack of evidence that the violations in the Richmond area are
due only to localized emissions, EPA does not believe that it would be appropriate to redesignate as attainment portions
of the Richmond ozone nonattainment area. Such an action would not be appropriate unless it were firmly established
that, contrary to the bases underlying the establishment of the boundaries of the Richmond ozone nonattainment area
following the 1990 Clean Air Act Amendments, certain portions of the Richmond ozone nonattainment area do not contribute
to nonattainment of other portions of the Richmond ozone nonattainment area. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
Final Action
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
EPA is disapproving both the request to redesignate the Richmond ozone nonattainment area to attainment and the associated
maintenance SIP revision, both submitted on November 12, 1992 by VDEQ. This disapproval will have the effect of retaining
the designations of Virginia for ozone found in 40 CFR part 81 (56 FR 56843) dated November 6, 1991. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Nothing in this action should be construed as permitting or allowing or establishing a precedent for any future request
for revision to any state implementation plan. Each request for revision to the state implementation plan shall be
considered separately in light of specific technical, economic, and environmental factors and in relation to relevant
statutory and regulatory requirements. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This action disapproving the request for redesignation of the Richmond moderate ozone nonattainment area and the
associated maintenance plan SIP revision has been classified as a Table 2 action for signature by the Acting Regional
Administrator under the procedures published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 on January 19, 1989 (54 FR 2214&hyph;2225), as revised by an October 4, 1993 memorandum from Michael H. Shapiro, Acting
Assistant Administrator for Air and Radiation. A future document will inform the general public of these tables.
On January 6, 1989, the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) waived Table 2 and Table 3 SIP revisions (54 FR 2222) from
the requirements of section 3 of Executive Order 12291 for a period of two years. The EPA has submitted a request for
a permanent waiver for Table 2 and 3 SIP revisions. The OMB has agreed to continue the waiver until such time as it rules
on U.S. EPA's request. This request continues in effect under Executive Order 12866, which superseded Executive
Order 12291 on September 30, 1993. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under section 307(b)(1) of the Clean Air Act, petitions for judicial review of this action must be filed in the United
States Court of Appeals for the appropriate circuit by July 5, 1994. Filing a petition for reconsideration by the Administrator
of this final rule does not affect the finality of this rule for the purposes of judicial review nor does it extend the
time within which a petition for judicial review may be filed, and shall not postpone the effectiveness of such rule
or action. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This action disapproving the request to redesignate the Richmond moderate ozone nonattainment area to attainment
and the associated maintenance plan SIP revision may not be challenged later in proceedings to enforce its requirements.

(k) The maintenance plan SIP revision, and request to redesignate the Richmond moderate ozone nonattainment area
to attainment were submitted on November 12, 1992, by the Department of Environmental Quality. These requests are
disapproved because review of the 1993 ambient air quality data monitored during the 1993 ozone season indicated
that a violation of the ozone NAAQS occurred at the Charles City monitor in the Richmond nonattainment area . Because
of the registered violation during the 1993 ozone season, the underlying basis of the Commonwealth's November 12,
1992 maintenance plan's demonstration is no longer valid.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The reef fish fishery of the Gulf of Mexico is managed under the Fishery Management Plan for the Reef Fish Resources
of the Gulf of Mexico (FMP). The FMP was prepared by the Gulf of Mexico Fishery Management Council and is implemented
through regulations at 50 CFR part 641 under the authority of the Magnuson Fishery Conservation and Management Act
(16 U.S.C. 1801 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=3 -->
et seq.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
). Those regulations set the commercial quota for red snapper in the Gulf of Mexico at 3.06 million lbs (1.39 million
kg) for the current fishing year, January 1 through December 31, 1994 (50 CFR 641.25(a)). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Under 50 CFR 641.26, NMFS is required to close the commercial fishery for a species or species group when the quota for
that species or species group is reached, or is projected to be reached, by publishing a document in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. Based on current statistics, NMFS has projected that the commercial quota of 3.06 million lbs (1.39 million kg) for
red snapper will be reached on April 27, 1994. Accordingly, the commercial fishery in the EEZ in the Gulf of Mexico for
red snapper is closed effective 12:01 a.m., local time, April 28, 1994, through December 31, 1994, the end of the fishing
year. A vessel with a valid reef fish permit having red snapper aboard must land and barter, trade, or sell such red snapper
prior to 12:01 a.m., local time, April 28, 1994. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
During the closure, the bag limit applies to all harvests of red snapper from the EEZ in the Gulf of Mexico. The daily
bag limit for red snapper is seven per person. From 12:01 a.m., local time, April 28, 1994, through December 31, 1994,
the purchase, barter, trade, or sale of red snapper taken from the EEZ is prohibited. This prohibition does not apply
to trade in red snapper that were harvested, landed, and bartered, traded, or sold prior to 12:01 a.m., local time,
April 28, 1994, and were held in cold storage by a dealer or processor.

 NMFS issues this final rule to implement measures contained in Framework Adjustment 1 to the Northeast Multispecies
Fishery Management Plan (FMP). NMFS implemented parts of Amendment 5 to the FMP on March 1, 1994, but delayed implementation
of some provisions, including the effort-reduction program, until May 1, to provide the industry and NMFS sufficient
time to prepare for this unprecedented and far-reaching change to the regulations. The effect of this delay is that
the first-year's effort reduction requirements are compressed into eight months with different impacts on different
segments of the fleet. The adjustment in the fishing year implemented by this rule will establish May 1 through April
30 as the annual fishing year for the effort reduction program contained in Amendment 5.

Background 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The New England Fishery Management Council (Council) submitted Amendment 5 to the NMFS on September 27, 1993, after
spending more than 2 years on its development. The primary purpose of Amendment 5 is to eliminate the overfished condition
of the primary stocks of the multispecies complex through an effort-reduction program. The effort-reduction program
consists of annual reductions in the numbers of days that vessels are allowed to spend at sea as a method to limit fishing
effort for groundfish. Vessels have a choice whether to fish under an individual allocation of days-at-sea (DAS),
based on each vessel's history of fishing for groundfish, or to fish under the fleet DAS option, wherein vessels must
declare blocks of time out of the fishery and lay over in port for a period proportional to the time fishing for groundfish.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
NMFS published the proposed rule for Amendment 5 on October 27, 1993 (58 FR 57774), and informed the Council on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
January 3, 1994, that Amendment 5 had been approved. At that time, the Director, Northeast Region, NMFS (Regional
Director) indicated that the expected implementation date for the amendment was to be March 1, 1994. The Council immediately
realized that the implementation of this comprehensive amendment would require NMFS' starting a number of new administrative
programs. The Council acknowledged the procedural and administrative difficulties and stated that it wanted NMFS
to implement the effort-reduction program only when the agency was ready. The Council also communicated its intent
that Amendment 5's effort-reduction program be implemented on a full-year basis, rather than on a part-year basis
for the first year, and initiated Framework Adjustment 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=6 f=1 -->
#
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
1 on February 16 to adjust the final rule for Amendment 5. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Council is making this adjustment to the final rule for Amendment 5 (59 FR 9872, March 1, 1994) under the framework
abbreviated rulemaking procedure established by Amendment 5 and contained in 50 CFR part 651, subpart C. This procedure
requires the Council, when making certain adjustments to the FMP, to develop and analyze the actions over the span
of at least two Council meetings. The Council provides the public with advance notice of both the proposals and the
analysis and an opportunity to comment on them prior to and at the second Council meeting. Upon review of the analysis
and public comment, the Council may recommend to the Regional Director that the measures of a given framework adjustment
be published as a final rule, if certain conditions are met. The Regional Director may publish the measures as a final
rule, or as a proposed rule if additional public comment is needed.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
When the Council began developing Amendment 5, groundfish stocks were overfished and the prospects were dim for improvement
without the effort-reduction program. Since then, the condition of the stocks has deteriorated to the point where
NMFS, with Council support, implemented emergency regulations to protect haddock. Each new assessment of groundfish
stocks underlines the urgency of implementing rigorous and effective management measures. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Council designed the management program using annual incremental reductions in fishing effort. The result of
implementing the effort-reduction program for less than 12 months in the first year is that vessels fishing under
the individual allocation option would have their annual allocation compressed into eight months, while vessels
under the fleet DAS would be required to meet the annual time-out requirement over eight months, instead of the full
year. Since the vessels in the individual DAS category generally choose to be in that group because of their higher
allocation of opportunity than under the fleet group, the conservation benefits of the first year's reductions in
allocation would be negated if the same allocation were distributed over only 8 months, instead of 12. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On the other hand, vessels in the fleet DAS category would be disproportionately burdened if they were required to
declare the same amount of time out of groundfishing over 8 months, that they would have to take over 12 months had Amendment
5 been implemented beginning on January 1. Many of the vessels in this category ordinarily would meet their time-out
requirement during the first few months of the year when the weather limits fishing opportunity, or when they are in
other winter fisheries such as northern shrimp. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A further need for Framework Adjustment 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=6 f=1 -->
#1
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 arises from the Amendment 5 requirement that all vessels declare one 20-day block out of groundfishing during the
spawning months of March, April, and May. Since NMFS decided to implement the effort-reduction program on May 1, that
requirement would be compressed into the month of May for the first year. As a result, at least two-thirds of the fleet
would be required to be out of groundfishing at the same time, unless Framework Adjustment 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=6 f=1 -->
#
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
1 were implemented. Many fishermen are unable to plan how to best use their time and resources during the required period
out of groundfishing given the relatively short notice, and the substantial impact that the sudden loss of two-thirds
of the domestic supply of groundfish might have on the processing sector and the market. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This final rule will adjust the rule implementing the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
effort-reduction program so that each allocation of DAS (fleet or individual) is done on a 365-day program year beginning
with the first full year of implementation of Amendment 5.

Comments and Responses 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
During the period following the approval of Amendment 5 and preceding the Council's formal initiation of the framework
adjustment, a number of individual fishermen, interested members of the public, and industry association representatives
commented on the problems with the current effort-reduction program implementation schedule. Since the comment
period had not begun, these comments were not tabulated; however, all comments were in support of the Council's expeditiously
making the adjustment that is contained in this rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
During the comment period spanning the two required Council meetings, the Council received written comments from
one individual and two associations_the Provincetown Draggermen's Association and the Seafood Harvester's Association
of New York. Oral comments were submitted by three individuals. All of the public comments supported the Council's
action and urged expeditious implementation. No negative comments were received on the proposed action during or
outside the comment period. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Council requested publication of the management measures as a final rule after considering the required factors
stipulated under the Framework Measures in Amendment 5 and providing supporting analysis for each factor considered.
The Assistant Administrator for Fisheries, NOAA (AA) determined that the framework adjustments to the FMP that this
rule would implement are consistent with the national standards, other provisions of the Magnuson Act, and other
applicable law. The AA, in making that determination, has taken into account the information, views, and comments
received during the two public hearings and comment period under the FMP's framework adjustment mechanism as specified
in 50 CFR 651.40. Considering the opportunity for public comment at Council meetings on January 12 through 13, February
16 through 17, March 17, and April 6 through 7, and Groundfish Committee meetings on February 2 through 3 and February
24, and considering the need for immediate resource protection for the groundfish stocks, the provisions for continuing
evaluation of the adjusted measures, and the timing of the rule relative to the requirement that all vessels take twenty
days out of the fishery during May, 1994, the AA has waived for good cause the proposed rules and additional comment
period.

This final rule has been determined to be ``not significant'' for purposes of E.O. 12866. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The AA finds there is good cause to waive prior notice under 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
5 U.S.C. 553(b) of the Administrative Procedure Act (APA). Prior notice is impracticable and contrary to the public
interest because it would cause undue burdens on some members of the groundfish fishing industry and would further
delay full implementation of conservation measures intended to replenish groundfish stocks. Further, the AA finds
that the public meetings held by the Council to discuss designation of beginning and ending dates for the fishing year
for this fishery provided opportunity for public comment to be considered. The AA finds that under section 553(d)
of the APA the need to have this regulation in place by May 1, 1994, is good cause to waive the 30-day delay in effectiveness
of this regulation.

DAS as calculated under paragraph (b)(2) of this section by 10 percent each fishing year, including the first year,
for the first 5 fishing years of the effort reduction program. Each fishing year shall begin on May 1 and extend 12 months
through April 30 of the following year.

has made a final determination on the appeal. Any DAS spent fishing for multispecies finfish shall be counted against
the Individual-DAS allocation that the vessel may ultimately receive. If before this appeal is decided, a vessel
exceeds the number of days it is finally allocated after appeal, the excess days will be subtracted from the vessel's
allocation of days in fishing year 1995.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The groundfish fishery in the BSAI 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
exclusive economic zone is managed by the Secretary of Commerce 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
according to the Fishery Management Plan for the Groundfish 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Fishery of the BSAI (FMP) prepared by the North Pacific Fishery Management Council under authority of the Magnuson
Fishery Conservation and Management Act. Fishing by U.S. vessels is governed by regulations implementing the FMP
at 50 CFR parts 620 and 675. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In accordance with &sect;675.20(a)(7)(ii), the Greenland turbot TAC for the AI was established by the final 1994
initial specifications of groundfish (59 FR 7656, February 16, 1994) and subsequent apportionment of reserve (59
FR 21673, April 26, 1994) as 2,333 metric tons (mt). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In accordance with &sect;675.20(a)(8), the Director of the Alaska Region, NMFS (Regional Director), has established
a directed fishing allowance of 1,400 mt, with consideration that 933 mt will be taken as incidental catch in directed
fishing for other species in the AI. In accordance with &sect;675.23(f), this fishery begins at 12 noon, A.l.t., May
1, 1994. Because of the low directed fishing allowance and high interest in the fishery, there will be insufficient
time to collect and analyze catch data and take appropriate action to ensure the directed fishing allowance is not
exceeded. Therefore, based on the best available data, the Regional Director has determined that the Greenland turbot
directed fishing allowance in the AI will be reached by 12 noon, A.l.t., May 4, 1994. Consequently, NMFS is prohibiting
directed fishing for Greenland turbot in the AI, effective from 12 noon, A.l.t., May 4, 1994, until 12 midnight, A.l.t.,
December 31, 1994.

SUMMARY:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 This interim rule amends the Department's section 8 regulations for newly constructed and substantially rehabilitated
housing projects to provide for the system of occupancy preferences in certain section 8 assisted housing authorized
by subtitle D of title VI of the Housing and Community Development Act of 1992. Subtitle D allow owners of section 8 projects
originally designed primarily for occupancy by elderly families to provide preferences to elderly families in selecting
tenants for available units in those projects. Owners that elect to provide preferences to elderly families as authorized
by subtitle D also must reserve no less than a statutorily determined number of units for disabled families who are
not elderly or near-elderly families.

 in Certain Section 8 Assisted Housing,'' and allows an owner of a covered section 8 housing project to elect to provide
preferences to elderly families in selecting tenants for available units in the project, subject to certain statutory
requirements. An owner who elects to provide preferences to elderly families must also reserve a percentage of units,
not to be less than the percentage determined according to a formula set out in the statute, for disabled families who

Definitions for ``elderly families'' and ``disabled families'' are codified in section 3(b) of the U.S. Housing
Act of 1937 (1937 Act). Section 3(b) was amended by section 621 of the 1992 HCD Act. Where the definition for ``elderly
families'' has, since 1974, encompassed disabled families, the amended section 3(b) now defines ``elderly families''
as families whose heads (or their spouses) or sole members are persons at least 62 years old. Thus, under the revised
definition, a disabled person does not qualify as an elderly family solely because of the person's disability. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 3(b) defines ``disabled families'' to mean families whose heads (or their spouses) or sole members are persons
with disabilities. ``Person with disabilities'' is defined to mean a person who: (1) has a disability as defined in
section 223 of the Social Security Act; (2) is determined pursuant to regulations issued by the Secretary of HUD, to
have a physical, mental or emotional impairment which is expected to be of long-continued and indefinite duration,
substantially impedes his or her ability to live independently, and is of such a nature that such ability could be improved
by more suitable housing conditions; or (3) has a developmental disability as defined in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
section 102 of the Developmental Disabilities Assistance and Bill of Rights Act. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

The Department's regulations for the terms defined in section 3(b) of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the 1937 Act for the assisted housing programs are published at 24 CFR part 812. While the 1992 HCD Act amendments to
section 3(b) of the 1937 Act require changes to 24 CFR part 812, this rule does not amend 24 CFR part 812. The Department
will modify 24 CFR part 812 by separate rulemaking. Also, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
unless the context indicates otherwise, reference to the terms elderly families, disabled families, and near-elderly
families in this preamble is reference to these terms as defined in section 3(b) of the 1937 Act, as amended by section
621 of the 1992 HCD Act.

Under section 3(b) of the 1937 Act, as revised by section 621 of the 1992 HCD Act, the term ``near-elderly families''

II. Eligibility To Provide Preferences for Elderly Residents 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 651 of the 1992 HCD Act provides in relevant part, ``[n]otwithstanding any other provision of law, an owner
of a 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
covered section 8 housing project designed primarily for occupancy by elderly families,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 may in selecting tenants for units in the project that become available for occupancy, give preference to elderly
families who have applied for occupancy in the housing&blank;*&blank;*&blank;*.'' (Emphasis added.) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
With regard to the phrase ``designed primarily for occupancy by elderly families,'' the Department believes that
in using the term ``primarily,'' the Congress intended to limit the applicability of subtitle D to either the section
8 units in those covered projects in which a majority of the section 8 units were designed for elderly families (i.e.,
seniors
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
3
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
), or to the section 8 units in covered projects where a distinct portion of the project (e.g., a tower or a wing of a project,
but not just a floor) exists in which the majority of section 8 units were restricted to seniors only. Thus, section
651 may apply to the section 8 units in an entire project originally designed primarily for occupancy by elderly families
(``covered section 8 housing project''), or section 651 may apply to the section 8 units in a portion of such project,
but only where the section 8 units in this project or portion of the project were designed primarily for seniors. The
preamble frequently uses the term ``covered section 8 units'' to recognize that there are partially assisted projects
whose section 8 units will be covered by this interim rule .

are 62 years or older.

It is important to note that the statutory system of preferences provided by subtitle D is only available to projects
which qualify as ``covered section 8 housing projects designed primarily for occupancy by elderly families.'' The
Department points out that many projects which have section 8 assistance are not ``covered section 8 housing projects
designed primarily for occupancy by elderly families'' (as defined in Section I.A. of the preamble, which follows),
and may not elect the subtitle D statutory system of preferences.

Subtitle D and these regulations define ``covered section 8 housing'' to mean housing that: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) was constructed or substantially rehabilitated pursuant to assistance provided under section 8(b)(2) of the
United States Housing Act of 1937 (1937 Act), as in effect before October 1, 1983; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) is assisted under a contract for assistance under such section; and (3) was originally designed primarily for
occupancy by elderly families.

8(b)(2) of the 1937 Act, as in Effect Before October 1, 1983. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department administers six section 8 programs that involve newly constructed or substantially rehabilitated
housing. However, the system of preferences under subtitle D does not apply to all these programs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The programs to which subtitle D applies are: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) The section 8 New Construction Program, 24 CFR part 880;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) The Section 8 Substantial Rehabilitation Program, 24 CFR part 881; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) The State Housing Agencies program (insofar as it involves new construction and substantial rehabilitation),
24 CFR part 883; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) The New Construction Set-Aside for Section 515 Rural Rental Housing Projects Program, 24 CFR part 884; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5) The Section 8 Housing Assistance Program for the Disposition of HUD-Owned Projects (insofar as it involves substantial
rehabilitation), 24 CFR part 886.

The ``Additional Assistance Program for Projects with HUD-Insured and HUD-Held Mortgages'' (see 24 CFR part 886,
subpart A) involves only existing housing. However, the ``Section 8 Housing Assistance Program for the Disposition
of HUD-owned Projects'' (see 24 CFR part 886, subpart C) involves substantially rehabilitated housing, in addition
to existing housing. Accordingly, this rule would amend subpart C of 24 CFR part 886, but only for projects involving
substantially rehabilitated housing.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
</FOOTNOTE>

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Other programs which may involve section 8 new construction or substantial rehabilitation assistance, but which
are not covered by the preferences in subtitle D are identified in section 658 of the 1992 HCD Act. Under section 658
of the 1992 HCD Act, an owner of a project (or portion of a project) that was originally designed for occupancy by elderly
families, and assisted under the Section 221(d)(3) Below Market Interest Rate (BMIR) program, the Section 236 Mortgage
Insurance and Interest Reduction Payment for Rental Projects program, or Section 202 Loans for Housing for the Elderly
or Handicapped Program, may continue to restrict occupancy in such projects (or portion of such projects) to elderly
families in accordance with the rules, standards and agreements in effect when the housing project was developed.
Accordingly, under this interim rule, the subtitle D statutory system of preferences does not apply to newly constructed
or substantially rehabilitated section 8 projects with HUD insurance or assistance under any of these three programs.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Department emphasizes that it is critical that a project owner understand the type of assistance a project receives
to determine eligibility under subtitle D and these regulations.

Although in this regard, the Department is aware of no Section 221(d)(3) BMIR projects or Section 236 projects with
Section 8 new construction or substantial rehabilitation assistance. As such, by its terms, ``covered section 8
housing'' does not seem to encompass the Section 236 Mortgage Insurance and Interest Reduction Payment for Rental
Projects program or the Section 221(d)(3) BMIR program.

2. Assisted Under a Contract for Assistance Under Section 8(b)(2) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Some newly constructed or substantially rehabilitated projects have unassisted units and assisted units. These
projects are often referred to as ``partially assisted projects.'' Because the statutory definition of ``covered
section 8 housing'' only applies to housing that is under a contract for assistance, the subtitle D system of preferences
would not apply to unassisted units in a partially assisted project. Additionally, nothing in this regulation establishes
a cap on the number of unassisted units for disabled families in a partially assisted project. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
While this regulation does not apply to the unassisted units in a partially assisted project, this regulation also
does not relieve any owner of any project, including the owner of a partially assisted project from complying with
the Fair Housing Amendments Act of 1988, section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, the implementing regulations
for these statutes, or any other applicable statutory or regulatory requirement, including the requirements of
the National Housing Act, with respect to the assisted or unassisted units. However, notwithstanding the foregoing,
owners may provide the preferences in accordance with this interim rule, with respect to the assisted units.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
3. Originally Designed Primarily for Occupancy by Elderly Families
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The final statutory requirement for qualification as a ``covered section 8 housing project'' is that the project
must have been originally designed for occupancy by elderly families. The statute does not define the term ``originally''
or define the phrase ``originally designed for occupancy by elderly families.'' However, the House Report offers
some insight on this subject. The House Report suggests that to qualify as housing originally designed for occupancy
by elderly families, the owner of the project must have expressed an intent to create housing for elderly tenants when
the developer negotiated with the Department for Federal financial assistance. (H.R. Rept. No. 760, 102d Cong. 2d
Sess. at 141 (1992).)
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Because the various types of housing projects covered by this interim rule were developed under several different
programs, and over a period of time which spans almost two decades, there is no uniform documentation at the Department
which evidences the population group to be served by a project. In many instances, the application in response to a
notice of funding availability (NOFA) shows that a project was designed as an elderly housing project. However, an
indication of the population group to be served by the housing project does not always appear in any one document. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition, because one of the previous definitions of ``elderly families'' in section 3(b) of the 1937 Act included
disabled families, it is not always clear from documents that indicate a project was developed for ``elderly families''
whether the project for elderly families was intended to mean housing for the broader eligible category of families
(i.e., elderly families and disabled families) or for families who qualified by virtue of age alone. Further confusion
may be added by the fact that for most of the period when this housing was being developed, the Department policy required
all housing for the elderly (defined by age) to incorporate certain accessible features and to design a certain percentage
of the units to be accessible for persons with physical disabilities. Typically, these units were made available
to eligible families with physical disabilities, regardless of age. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Thus, in establishing whether a project was originally designed primarily for occupancy by elderly families within
the meaning of subtitle D, two distinctions must be drawn: (1) The project was designed primarily for elderly families
(as opposed to non-elderly families); and (2) the project was designed for elderly families (i.e., seniors), and
not designed for elderly families under the broader meaning of this term, which formerly included elderly families
and disabled families.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Recognizing all these factors, the interim rule provides for supporting documentation to be drawn from a variety
of sources. These sources are identified as being either ``primary'' sources, or ``secondary'' sources. The interim
rule provides that if at least one of the primary sources clearly establishes that a project was originally designed
for elderly families (seniors), the owner of this project may elect the system of preferences provided by subtitle
D. However, if another primary source establishes a design contrary to the primary source upon which the owner would
base support that the project is a covered section 8 housing project, the owner cannot make the election of preferences
provided by subtitle D without finding support in secondary sources. Secondary sources may then, as discussed in
this interim rule, be used to establish the use for which the project was originally designed. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If there are no primary sources clearly establishing the original design of the project, then original design may
still be established through secondary sources. At least two secondary sources must support that the project was
designed as elderly (seniors) housing in the absence of primary documentation in order to establish such intention
for elderly housing. Additionally, in the case of conflict between primary sources, and the owner chooses to rely
on secondary sources, then at least two secondary sources must support that the project was designed as elderly (seniors)
housing. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Primary sources. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Primary sources that would evidence that a project was originally designed for occupancy by elderly families (seniors)
include any of the following: the application in response to the notice of funding availability (NOFA); the terms
of the NOFA under which the application was solicited; the regulatory agreement, the loan commitment, the bid invitation,
the owner's management plan, or any other underwriting or financial document collected at or before loan closing.
If any one of these project documents clearly evidence that the project was originally designed primarily for elderly
families (seniors), the owner would be eligible to elect to apply the system of preferences provided under these regulations
so long as the primary documents do not conflict. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Secondary sources. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As discussed above, if primary sources do not evidence that the population intended to be served by the project were
elderly families (seniors), an owner may elect the system of preferences provided by subtitle D if the owner is able
to produce evidence from two secondary sources that clearly evidence that the project was originally designed primarily
for elderly families (seniors). Secondary sources include: (1) Lease records from the earliest two years of occupancy
for which records are available showing that occupancy has been restricted primarily to households where the head,
spouse, or sole member is 62 years of age or older; (2) evidence that services for elderly persons have been provided,
such as services funded by the Older Americans Act, transportation to senior citizen centers, or programs coordinated
with the Area Agency on Aging; (3) project unit mix with a higher percentage of efficiency and one-bedroom units [a
secondary source particularly relevant to distinguishing elderly projects under the previous section 3(b) definition
(in which disabled families were included in the definition of ``elderly families'') from non-elderly projects
and which in combination with other factors (such as the number of accessible units) may be useful in distinguishing
projects for seniors from those serving the broader definition of ``elderly families'' which includes disabled
families]; or (4) any other relevant type of historical data unless clearly contradicted by other comparable evidence.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As discussed above, the lack of uniform documentation, and the possible lack of distinction between: (1) Elderly
projects which are seniors housing, and (2) elderly projects which planned to serve disabled families equally with
seniors, make the determination of whether a project is a ``covered section 8 housing project'' a difficult one. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department is specifically interested in public comment on this issue, particularly with respect to the existence
(or lack thereof) of documentation that would show the original population group intended to be served by the project,
other types of evidence that might be considered, and how to distinguish between: (1) Projects for elderly families,
which included, and intended to include, disabled families, from (2) projects for elderly families which served
disabled families only incidentally.

B. Projects That Do Not Elect Subtitle D System of Preferences: Section 657 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Department emphasizes that the system of preferences provided by subtitle D and these regulations is not mandatory,
and is available at the election of the multifamily housing owner. In accordance with section 657 of the 1992 HCD Act,
an owner of a covered section 8 housing project that does not elect to implement the system of preferences provided
by subtitle D would continue to provide housing for elderly families without incurring any obligation (beyond that
mandated by the specific authorizing statutes and any other applicable statutory requirements) to provide housing
for elderly families and/or non-elderly and disabled families. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For covered section 8 projects for which the owner does not elect the subtitle D system of preferences, the new definition
of ``elderly families'' established by section 621 of the 1992 HCD Act would 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
not
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 apply. Rather the former definition in section 3(b) of the 1937 Act, which includes the non-elderly disabled families
in the meaning of ``elderly families,'' would be applicable, and elderly families under this broader definition
(i.e., elderly families 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
and 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
disabled families) would be eligible for units in these projects for which the election of preferences was not taken
to the same extent that such families were eligible before enactment of the 1992 HCD Act. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The non-election of the subtitle D system of preferences does not override any occupancy requirements affecting
covered section 8 housing designed primarily for occupancy by elderly families based on the authority of regulatory
agreements or statutory provisions governing the FHA mortgage insurance programs. By way of example, the enabling
statute for the Section 231 Program (``Housing Mortgage Insurance for the Elderly'') mandates that not less than
50 percent of the units in a Section 231 project must be designed for the use of elderly persons, meaning any person,
married or single, who is 62 years of age or over. Accordingly, not all members of the entire population group encompassed
by the pre-1992 HCD Act definition of ``elderly families'' (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
i.e., 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
elderly families and non-elderly disabled families), are eligible for elderly units in Section 231 projects. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Application of the pre-1992 HCD Act definition could make it impossible to meet the statutory percentage requirement
of the Section 231 Program or a higher percentage that may have been specified in the regulatory agreement or in other
authority. Therefore, owners of Section 231 projects (where the projects are also covered section 8 housing designed
primarily for occupancy by elderly families) who do not make an election to be covered by the subtitle D system of preferences
will continue to follow the standards of Section 231 of the National Housing Act and the terms of their regulatory agreement
or other controlling documentation in determining the eligibility of elderly families for occupancy in their projects.
This position is consistent with section 657 of subtitle D which provides that where the owner does not elect the preference
scheme, ``elderly families'' as defined by the pre-1992 HCD Act definition, shall be eligible for occupancy ``
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
to the same extent 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
that such families were eligible before the date of enactment [of the 1992 HCD Act.] (emphasis added.)''

III. Implementation of Preferences for Elderly Families 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
An owner who elects to provide preferences for elderly families in accordance with section 651, and who can compile
and, on request, produce the required documentation to support a determination that the project was designed primarily
for occupancy by elderly families (seniors), may, in selecting tenants for units in the project that become available
for occupancy after the effective date of this regulation, give preference to elderly families who have applied for
occupancy in the housing. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
An owner of a covered section 8 project is not required to solicit or obtain the approval of HUD before exercising the
election of preference for elderly families provided by subtitle D. The owner, if challenged on the issue of the ``coverage''
of the project, must be able to support the project's coverage, and the owner's eligibility to make the election of
preference through the production of the supporting evidence discussed earlier in this preamble. (The owner may
be challenged by, among others, existing tenants, applicants for tenancy or HUD on this issue.) Additionally, the
Department reserves the right at any time to review and make determinations regarding the accuracy of the determination
of the project as an eligible project. The Department can make such determinations as a result of its ongoing monitoring
of activities, or the conduct of complaint investigations and compliance reviews required under the Fair Housing
Act (42 U.S.C. 3601&hyph;19), section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (29 U.S.C. 794) and other applicable statutes.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
When establishing the preference for elderly families, an owner also must reserve units for occupancy by disabled
families who are not elderly or near-elderly, as explained below. In no case, may an owner evict, without good cause,
a family that is lawfully residing in a unit in a covered section 8 housing project to achieve the occupancy level that
has been determined under the system of preferences or the reservation of units set forth in this interim rule. (Good
cause would not exist where the eviction stemmed from the system of preferences or the reservation of units, or because
of any action taken by the Secretary or owner pursuant to subtitle D.) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
A. Reservation of Units for Disabled Families Who Are Neither Elderly Nor Near-Elderly: Section 652 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
If an owner elects to provide preferences for elderly families for admission to a project or a portion of a project that
is determined to be ``covered section 8 housing project'' in accordance with section 651, then section 652 requires
the owner also to reserve covered section 8 units in the project for occupancy by disabled families who are not elderly
or near-elderly. The number of units to be reserved for disabled families who are not elderly or near-elderly is based
on a calculation prescribed in section 652(b). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under section 652(b), an owner who elects to provide preferences for elderly families must determine the percentage
of covered section 8 units occupied by disabled families who are not elderly or near-elderly on October 28, 1992, which
is the date of enactment of the 1992 HCD Act (the October 28, 1992 percentage). The next step is for the owner to compare
the October 28, 1992 percentage to the percentage of covered section 8 units occupied by disabled families who are
not elderly or near-elderly on January 1, 1992 (the January 1, 1992 percentage), in order to determine the highest
occupancy percentage of disabled families who are not elderly or near-elderly in 1992. The owner must reserve the
highest occupancy percentage (either the October 28, 1992 percentage or the January 1, 1992 percentage), up to a maximum
of 10 percent of the covered section 8 units, for disabled families who are not elderly or near-elderly. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under the statute and these regulations, an owner may, but is never obligated to, admit disabled families who are not
elderly or near-elderly to more than 10 percent of the covered section 8 units. The actual percentage required is the
highest percentage in occupancy on the two ``snapshot'' dates in 1992 (again October 28, 1992 or January 1, 1992),
unless that number exceeds 10 percent, in which case the requirement is set at 10 percent. Thus, under the statutory
formula and this interim rule, if a project did not have any disabled families who are not elderly or near-elderly residing
in the covered section 8 units on both January 1, 1992 and October 28, 1992, the owner would not be required to reserve
any covered section 8 units for such families. The Department believes that few, if any, projects will fall into this
category. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
While the percentage of covered section 8 units required to be reserved may vary between 10 percent and zero, the Department
reiterates that the required percentage is not a ceiling, and owners are encouraged to reserve (or permit admission
to) a higher percentage of covered section 8 units for disabled families who are not elderly or near-elderly where
the need exists. Owners who choose to reserve (or permit admission to) a greater percentage of covered section 8 units
than the percentage which is statutorily required for disabled families who are not elderly or near-elderly would
not incur any obligation to continue maintaining the higher percentage (than statutorily required by subtitle D)
as vacancies arise.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In calculating actual utilization of units reserved for disabled families who are not elderly or near-elderly, units
occupied by elderly families where a member of the family is disabled do not count as part of the required percentage.
Another factor to be considered is that the percentage of units which are reserved under subtitle D for disabled families
who are not elderly or near-elderly is not linked to specific units. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Since most elderly projects, even when designed for occupancy by seniors, have a portion of the units designed to be
accessible and usable by persons with physical disabilities, there may be a tendency to assume that these ``accessible''
units will be designated to fulfill the required percentage of units reserved for disabled families who are not elderly
or near-elderly. This is not the case. Disabled families who are not elderly or near-elderly and therefore qualify
for the units reserved under subtitle D may have any one of a variety of disabilities, many of which will not require
an accessible unit. Thus, in determining whether a project has met its obligation under subtitle D, the relevant factor
is the number of disabled families who are not elderly or near-elderly in occupancy, not the units in which they reside.
The accessible units may be occupied by elderly families, or by a mixture of elderly families and disabled families
who are not elderly or near-elderly. Similarly, a project may have reached its required percentage of occupancy by
disabled families who are not elderly or near-elderly, and have vacant accessible units. In such case, an owner is
under no obligation to offer these units to disabled families before offering such units to elderly families. However,
the owner must offer such vacant accessible units to current tenants who need any of the accessible features of the
unit before offering it to the first elderly or non-elderly family on the waiting list. In selecting from the waiting
list, the owner can give elderly disabled families who need the accessible unit a preference over elderly non-disabled
families. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department emphasizes that when a vacancy occurs and it is a disabled family's turn to be placed in a project pursuant
to the preference system, the fact that the vacant unit may not be accessible, does not entitle the housing provider
to skip over the disabled family. Where the available unit is not accessible and the disabled family needs an accessible
unit, the housing provider is to accommodate the family, either by (1) making that unit accessible, or (2) by transferring
a tenant who is living in an accessible unit but does not need an accessible unit to the inaccessible unit and offering
the disabled family an accessible unit. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
B. Secondary System of Preferences: Section 653. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Under the statutory system of preferences, if there are an insufficient number of elderly families to fill vacant
covered section 8 units, an owner may give a secondary preference to disabled families who are near-elderly. Similarly,
if there are an insufficient number of disabled families who are not elderly or near-elderly to fill vacant covered
section 8 units reserved for such disabled families, an owner may give a secondary preference to disabled families
who are near-elderly to fill those units. However, in the event that there are an insufficient number of elderly families,
disabled families who are not elderly or near-elderly, or near-elderly disabled families to fill vacancies that
occur, the owner must make vacant covered section 8 units generally available to eligible families who apply for housing,
without regard to the statutory system of preferences or reservation of units. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The statute looks to the Department to establish a standard for determining whether there are an insufficient number
of families to fill vacant units subject to the preferences or reservations established in this interim rule. These
standards are already in place in the existing section 8 regulations. The interim rule provides that before an owner
can determine that there are an insufficient number of families to fill vacant covered section 8 units, an owner must
conduct marketing to attract applicants qualifying for the preferences (including outreach to such applicants)
in accordance with &sect;&sect;880.601(a), 881.601(a), 883.702(a), 884.226, or 886.321(a), as applicable. Additionally,
the owner must make a good faith effort to lease to applicants qualifying for the preferences (which must include taking
all feasible actions to fill vacancies by renting to such families), and not reject any such applicant family except
for reasons acceptable to the Department or the contract administrator (in accordance with HUD guidelines).

C. Waiting Lists 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Owners of covered section 8 housing projects designed primarily for occupancy by elderly families, which are required
to have a percentage of covered section 8 units reserved for disabled families who are not elderly or near-elderly
pursuant to section 652, or which have other units available to disabled families pursuant to statutory and regulatory
requirements (e.g., near-elderly disabled families admitted under the secondary preferences of section 653) would
not be able to use this interim rule to remove applicants from a waiting list. Moreover, an owner would have to continue
to select applicants for covered section 8 vacant units in accordance with current HUD procedures with the exception
noted below. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Procedures presently in effect provide that the applicant's place on the waiting list and the application of preferences
determine the order of selection for admission. Section 655 provides that the existing Federal preferences apply
within each group (i.e. elderly families, disabled families who are not elderly or near-elderly, and disabled families
who are near-elderly) to the extent that they currently apply under each applicable multifamily housing program.

However, under this interim rule, if the applicants at the top of the waiting list are disabled families who are not
elderly or near-elderly, and such disabled families currently occupy the full percentage of covered section 8 units
required to be reserved for them under subtitle D, the owner may, but is not required to, skip over the disabled applicants
on the waiting list, and select elderly families for vacant covered section 8 units. The owner would only be required
to select disabled families who are not elderly or near-elderly, and who are at the top of the waiting list for vacant
covered section 8 units when: (1) The number of disabled families who are not elderly or near-elderly in covered section
8 units drops below the minimum required percentage, (2) the owner has adopted a secondary preference under section
653(a) of the 1992 HCD Act, and there are not sufficient numbers of elderly families or near-elderly disabled families
to fill the elderly units (in accordance with section 654 of the 1992 HCD Act), or (3) the owner has not adopted a secondary
preference under section 653(a), and there are not sufficient numbers of elderly families to fill the elderly units.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
It is important to note that some projects which do not have to reserve any units for non-elderly disabled families
under subtitle D may have disabled families who are not elderly or near-elderly on their waiting lists. If a project
originally designed primarily for occupancy by elderly families would not have to reserve any units for disabled
families who are not elderly or near-elderly under subtitle D, the owner would not have to admit such disabled families
on the waiting list to covered section 8 units, nor would any additional non-elderly families have to be added to the
waiting list for covered section 8 units. The owner would, of course, have to admit disabled families who are also elderly,
and provide such families with the same preference for admission as non-disabled elderly families. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Also, an owner who has adopted a secondary preference under section 653(a) would admit, and give a preference to, near-elderly
disabled families, if there are insufficient numbers of elderly families to fill the elderly units. An owner who has
adopted a secondary preference under section 653(a) would also admit families without regard to age (including disabled
families that are not elderly or near-elderly) if there are not sufficient numbers of elderly families or near-elderly
disabled families to fill the elderly units (pursuant to section 654). An owner who has not adopted a secondary preference
under section 653(a) would admit applicants without regard to age (including disabled families that are not elderly
or near-elderly) if there are not sufficient numbers of elderly families to fill the elderly units. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Even where there are sufficient numbers of elderly families to fill the elderly units, an owner may elect to admit disabled
families who are not elderly or near-elderly to covered section 8 units, and the Department encourages this voluntary
policy, particularly where the need exists and the units are available. Owners who choose to admit such disabled families
in excess of the statutorily-mandated minimum may do so without incurring any continuing obligation as such disabled
families voluntarily move out, and without losing their project's identification as a project designed primarily
for occupancy by elderly families. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In any case, when an owner's decision to provide preferences to elderly families under subtitle D would have an adverse
effect on non-elderly families on the waiting list, the owner would be required to notify those families of the new
policy and how this policy may affect them. The notification requirement would be triggered if the current percentage
of disabled families who are neither elderly nor near-elderly exceeds the minimum required percentage, and non-elderly
families on the waiting list (including those with disabilities) may be passed over for covered section 8 units for
the elderly, or if the project is one of the few which will have no units set aside for such disabled families under subtitle
D.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
Justification for Interim Rulemaking 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
It is the Department's general policy to publish a rule for notice and comment before issuing a rule for effect in accordance
with the Department's own rule on rulemaking, codified at 24 CFR part 10. However, part 10 provides for exceptions
from that general rule where the agency finds good cause to omit advance notice and public participation. The good
cause requirement is satisfied when prior public procedure is determined to be ``impracticable, unnecessary, or
contrary to the public interest.'' (See 24 CFR 10.1) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department finds that good cause exists to publish this interim rule for effect without notice and prior public
comment because the Department has determined that, with the exception of possible clarifying changes at the final
rule stage, public comment will not alter the standards set forth in this interim rule for making the election of preferences
provided by subtitle D, and is therefore unnecessary. The interim rule adopts the standards for the election of preferences
for elderly families and reservation of units for disabled families as set forth in the statute. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Subtitle D establishes which section 8 housing projects are eligible for the election of preferences provided by
subtitle D. Subtitle D establishes that the ``elderly families'' eligible to reside in covered section 8 housing
projects for which the owner has made the election of preferences provided by subtitle D are those families who meet
the definition of ``elderly families'' as set forth in section 3(b) of the 1937 Act, as amended by section 621 of the
1992 HCD Act. Subtitle D establishes the formula by which an owner will determine the number of units in the covered
section 8 housing project that must be reserved for occupancy by disabled families who are not elderly or near-elderly.
Subtitle D establishes the secondary system of preferences available to owners if there are insufficient numbers
of elderly families to occupy all the units reserved for elderly families. Subtitle D also establishes the procedures
to be followed if units remain vacant after the owner has elected to provide the secondary system of preferences, and
the procedures to be followed concerning the order of selection within groups to whom a preference has been given.
The interim rule adopts all these statutory provisions without substantive change. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The interim rule departs from the statute in providing the types of documents that an owner must be able to produce in
the event the owner is challenged on the issue of whether the owner's project is eligible for the election of preferences
provided by subtitle D. The statute does not provide how the owner may support that the owner's section 8 housing project
was originally designed primarily for occupancy by elderly families (i.e., seniors). The interim rule provides
a list of documents which the owner may rely upon as support for determining project eligibility to make the election
of preferences provided by subtitle D. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department carefully considered which documents may evidence project eligibility for the subtitle D system
of preferences. As discussed earlier in the preamble, because of the various types of housing projects covered by
subtitle D and this interim rule, and because these housing projects were developed under several different programs
and over a period of time which spans almost two decades, there is no uniform documentation at the Department which
identifies the population group to be served by the project. Additionally, and again as discussed earlier in the preamble,
the difficulty in identifying the population group to be served is added by the fact that the previous definition of
``elderly families'' in the 1937 Act included disabled families, and the Department's policy required all housing
for the elderly (defined by age) to incorporate certain accessible features and to design a certain percentage of
units to be accessible for persons with physical disabilities. The Department specifically requests comments from
the public on the list of supporting documents provided in the interim rule, and this provision may change following
public comment.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Department recognizes that there may be questions concerning the Department's use of interim rulemaking for
subtitle D of title VI, but not for subtitle B of the title VI. Subtitle B provides public housing agencies (PHAs) with
the option, subject to certain requirements, to designate public housing projects, or portions of these projects,
for occupancy by elderly families, by disabled families, or elderly families and disabled families. Under subtitle
B, to elect this option, a PHA must submit an allocation plan to the Department for review and approval before designating
a project for occupancy by one of the three categories of families listed in the statute. Additionally, for projects
to be designated for occupancy by disabled families, the statute requires the PHA also must submit, and receive approval
of, a supportive service plan. The Department added requirements, by regulation, to the allocation plan and supportive
service plan to supplement those set forth in the statute. For this reason, it was necessary to provide the public with
advance notice and public comment before making those regulatory requirements effective. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Additionally, to the extent that this subtitle D rule, which concerns section 8 housing, and the subtitle B rule, which
concerns public housing, address similar issues, the public comments on the subtitle B rule are applicable to this
interim rule. Both statutes (subtitle D and subtitle B), which permit housing to be reserved for occupancy by elderly
families, may have the affect of reducing housing assistance for non-elderly disabled persons. Subtitle D attempts
to minimize the reduction of housing assistance for non-elderly disabled families by limiting the preference for
elderly families to covered section 8 housing that was originally designed primarily for occupancy by elderly families.
Subtitle D also requires owners of these covered projects to reserve units in the covered project for disabled families
who are neither elderly nor near-elderly, and the number of units to be reserved is determined in accordance with the
formula established by the statute. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Subtitle B attempts to minimize the reduction of housing assistance for non-elderly disabled families by requiring
housing authorities that designate projects for elderly families to submit a plan for securing sufficient additional
resources that the agency owns, controls, or has received preliminary notification that it will obtain, or for which
the agency plans to apply that will be sufficient to provide assistance to not less than the number of non-elderly disabled
families that would have been housed but for the designation of the project for elderly families. Further, both statutes
prohibit the eviction of any tenant lawfully residing in a section 8 covered project or a public housing project because
the project is to be reserved for elderly families or to be designated for elderly families. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Persons with disabilities commenting on the subtitle B rule were concerned about the possible reduction of public
housing assistance for non-elderly disabled families as a result of projects designated for elderly families, and
several requested that the Department not permit designated housing. The Department anticipates that persons with
disabilities will have the same concerns about the subtitle D rule, and perhaps make similar comments. However, in
both cases, the statute permits the reservation or designation for projects for occupancy by elderly families, and
the Department cannot preclude this an as option for project owners or housing authorities. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Persons with disabilities commenting on the subtitle B rule requested that the Department carefully monitor the
statutory protections provided for non-elderly disabled families. The Department anticipates that persons with
disabilities commenting on the subtitle D rule will make similar comments. The Department will monitor both the subtitle
D reservation, and the subtitle B designation, to ensure, to the extent possible, that there is minimum adverse impact
on non-elderly disabled families. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Persons with disabilities commenting on the subtitle B rule stated that their concern about loss of access to projects
designated for elderly families should be construed to mean a concern about reduction of housing assistance generally,
and not concern about loss of access to ``elderly'' projects. These commenters stated that an integrated housing
setting is not a project that houses only elderly families and disabled families. The commenters asked the Department
to make available section 8 assistance to non-elderly disabled families so that they could live in housing with ``mainstream''
populations. The Department anticipates that similar comments will be made by persons with disabilities on the subtitle
D rule. The Department will make every effort to increase section 8 housing assistance for non-elderly disabled persons.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Given the statutory framework of the system of preferences for elderly families authorized by the subtitle D rule,
the Department reiterates that, except for the types of documentation a project owner should be able to produce to
support a determination of eligibility to make the election of preferences, there is very little that will change
at the final rule stage as a result of public comments. Given the similarity of certain issues addressed by subtitle
D and subtitle B, the Department also reiterates that those comments received on the subtitle B rule and that are applicable
to this rule were taken into consideration in developing this interim rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Although this interim rule is being published for effect within 30 days from the date of publication, the Department
requests comments from the public on this interim rule, and the public comments will be considered by the Department
in development of the final rule.

Executive Order 12612, Federalism 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The General Counsel, as the Designated Official under section 6(a) of Executive order 12612, Federalism, has determined
that the policies contained in this interim rule will not have substantial direct effects on states or their political
subdivisions, or the relationship between the Federal government and the states, or on the distribution of power
and responsibilities among the various levels of government. Specifically, the interim rule is directed to owners
of multifamily housing projects, and will not impinge upon the relationship between the Federal Government and State
and local governments. As a result, the interim rule is not subject to review under the order.

Executive Order 12606, the Family 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The General Counsel, as the Designated Official under Executive Order 12606, The Family, has determined that this
interim rule does not have potential for significant impact on family formation, maintenance, and general well-being
within the meaning of the order. This interim rule implements the system of preferences authorized by subtitle D of
title VI of the 1992 HCD Act, which provides that owners of certain section 8 covered projects that were originally
designed primarily for occupancy by elderly families (i.e., families whose heads, spouses or sole members are 62
years or older) may elect to give preference in occupancy to vacant units in the project to elderly families. Although
subtitle D provides for preferences for elderly families in projects meeting the conditions established by subtitle
D, subtitle D also requires that owners of such projects must reserve no less than a minimum number of units in these
projects for disabled families who are not elderly or near-elderly. The minimum number is determined in accordance
with the formula established by statute. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Since the subtitle D preference system provides a primary preference for elderly families, and a secondary preference
for disabled families who are near-elderly, there is the possibility that this statutory system of preferences would
limit the availability of certain section 8 housing for: (1) Disabled families who are not elderly or near-elderly
(if an owner gives preference to elderly families for units), and (2) such families with children, and thus adversely
impact the maintenance and well-being of these families. (Although owners can apply the same preferences and reservation
of units to families with children as to families without children, owners cannot restrict admission to any units
solely because of familial status as long as the family qualifies for the unit on the basis of the relevant age or disability
criterion for admission.) The Department believes that the number of projects that would be eligible for the preferences
provided by subtitle D is limited, and thus, the impact on family maintenance and well being would not be significant
within the meaning of the order.

interim rule, and in so doing certifies that this interim rule would not have a significant economic impact on a substantial
number of small entities. This interim rule reflects a system of occupancy preferences authorized by statute which
applies to section 8 newly constructed or substantially rehabilitated housing without regard to the size of entities
involved.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(i) An owner of a project assisted under this part (including a partially assisted project) that was originally designed
primarily for occupancy by elderly families (an ``eligible project'') may elect to give preference to elderly families
in selecting tenants for assisted, vacant units in the project, subject to the requirements of this section. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) For purposes of this section, a project eligible for the preference provided by this section, and for which the
owner makes an election to give preference in occupancy to elderly families is referred to as an ``elderly project.''
``Elderly families'' refers to families whose heads of household, their spouses or sole members are 62 years or older.

occupancy provided in paragraph (a)(1) of this section. The owner, however, if challenged on the issue of eligibility
of the project for the election provided in paragraph (a)(1) of this section must be able to support the project's eligibility
through the production of supporting evidence as provided in paragraph (b) of this section. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) The Department reserves the right at any time to review and make determinations regarding the accuracy of the
identification of the project as an elderly project. The Department can make such determinations as a result of ongoing
monitoring activities, or the conduct of complaint investigations and compliance reviews required under the Fair
Housing Act (42 U.S.C. 3601 through 19), section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (29 U.S.C. 794) and other applicable

shall consist of at least one item from the sources (``primary'' sources) listed in paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this section,
or at least two items from the sources (``secondary'' sources) listed in paragraph (b)(1)(ii) of this section:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Identification of the project (or portion of a project) as serving elderly (seniors) families in at least one primary
source such as: the application in response to the notice of funding availability; the terms of the notice of funding
availability under which the application was solicited; the regulatory agreement; the loan commitment; the bid
invitation; the owner's management plan, or any other underwriting or financial document collected at or before
loan closing;

or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) Secondary sources.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Two or more sources of evidence such as: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
lease records from the earliest two years of occupancy for which records are available showing that occupancy has
been restricted primarily to households where the head, spouse or sole member is 62 years of age or older; evidence
that services for elderly persons have been provided, such as services funded by the Older Americans Act, transportation
to senior citizen centers, or programs coordinated with the Area Agency on Aging; project unit mix with a higher percentage
of efficiency and one-bedroom units [a secondary source particularly relevant to distinguishing elderly projects
under the previous section 3(b) definition (in which disabled families were included in the definition of ``elderly
families'') from non-elderly projects and which in combination with other factors (such as the number of accessible
units) may be useful in distinguishing projects for seniors from those serving the broader definition of ``elderly
families'' which includes disabled families]; or any other relevant type of historical data, unless clearly contradicted
by other comparable evidence.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 If a primary source establishes a design contrary to that established by the primary source upon which the owner would
base support that the project is an eligible project (as defined in this section), the owner cannot make the election
of preferences for elderly families as provided by this section based upon primary sources alone. In any case where
the primary sources do not provide clear evidence of original design of the project for occupancy primarily by elderly
families, including those cases where primary documents conflict, secondary sources may be used to establish the
use for which the project was originally designed.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) The Department reserves the right at any time to review and make determinations regarding the accuracy of the

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Evidence that a project assisted under this part (or portion of a project) was originally designed primarily for occupancy
by elderly families, and is therefore eligible for the election of occupancy preference provided by this section,
shall consist of at least one item from the sources (``primary'' sources) listed in paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this section,
or at least two items from the sources (``secondary'' sources) listed in paragraph (b)(1)(ii) of this section:

 Identification of the project (or portion of a project) as serving elderly (seniors) families in at least one primary
source such as: The application in response to the notice of funding availability; the terms of the notice of funding
availability under which the application was solicited; the regulatory agreement; the loan commitment; the bid
invitation; the owner's management plan, or any other underwriting or financial document collected at or before

or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) Secondary sources.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Two or more sources of evidence such as: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Lease records from the earliest two years of occupancy for which records are available showing that occupancy has
been restricted primarily to households where the head, spouse or sole member is 62 years of age or older; evidence
that services for elderly persons have been provided, such as services funded by the Older Americans Act, transportation
to senior citizen centers, or programs coordinated with the Area Agency on Aging; project unit mix with a higher percentage
of efficiency and one-bedroom units [a secondary source particularly relevant to distinguishing elderly projects
under the previous section 3(b) definition (in which disabled families were included in the definition of ``elderly

 If a primary source establishes a design contrary to that established by the primary source upon which the owner would
base support that the project is an eligible project (as defined in this section), the owner cannot make the election
of preferences for elderly families as provided by this section based upon primary sources alone. In any case where
the primary sources do not provide clear evidence of original design of the project for occupancy primarily by elderly
families, including those cases where primary documents conflict, secondary sources may be used to establish the
use for which the project was originally designed.

of preferences for elderly families as provided by this section based upon primary sources alone. In any case where
the primary sources do not provide clear evidence of original design of the project for occupancy primarily by elderly
families, including those cases where primary documents conflict, secondary sources may be used to establish the
use for which the project was originally designed.

 (i) An owner of a project assisted under this part (including a partially assisted project) that was originally designed

of the project for the election provided in paragraph (a)(1) of this section must be able to support the project's eligibility
through the production of supporting evidence as provided in paragraph (b) of this section. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) The Department reserves the right at any time to review and make determinations regarding the accuracy of the
identification of the project as an elderly project. The Department can make such determinations as a result of ongoing
monitoring activities, or the conduct of complaint investigations and compliance reviews required under the Fair
Housing Act (42 U.S.C. 3601 through 19), section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (29 U.S.C. 794) and other applicable

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Two or more sources of evidence such as: Lease records from the earliest two years of occupancy for which records are
available showing that occupancy has been restricted primarily to households where the head, spouse or sole member
is 62 years of age or older; evidence that services for elderly persons have been provided, such as services funded
by the Older Americans Act, transportation to senior citizen centers, or programs coordinated with the Area Agency
on Aging; project unit mix with a higher percentage of efficiency and one-bedroom units [a secondary source particularly
relevant to distinguishing elderly projects under the previous section 3(b) definition (in which disabled families
were included in the definition of ``elderly families'') from non-elderly projects and which in combination with
other factors (such as the number of accessible units) may be useful in distinguishing projects for seniors from those
serving the broader definition of ``elderly families'' which includes disabled families]; or any other relevant
type of historical data, unless clearly contradicted by other comparable evidence.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (i) An owner is not required to solicit or obtain the approval of HUD before exercising the election of preference for
occupancy provided in paragraph (a)(1) of this section. The owner, however, if challenged on the issue of eligibility
of the project for the election provided in paragraph (a)(1) of this section must be able to support the project's eligibility
through the production of supporting evidence as provided in paragraph (b) of this section. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) The Department reserves the right at any time to review and make determinations regarding the accuracy of the
identification of the project as an elderly project. The Department can make such determinations as a result of ongoing
monitoring activities, or the conduct of complaint investigations and compliance reviews required under the Fair
Housing Act (42 U.S.C. 3601 through 19), section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (29 U.S.C. 794) and other applicable
statutes.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Evidence supporting project eligibility.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Evidence that a project assisted under this part (or portion of a project) was originally designed primarily for occupancy
by elderly families, and is therefore eligible for the election of occupancy preference provided by this section,
shall consist of at least one item from the sources (``primary'' sources) listed in paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this section,
or at least two items from the sources (``secondary'' sources) listed in paragraph (b)(1)(ii) of this section: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Primary sources.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Identification of the project (or portion of a project) as serving elderly (seniors) families in at least one primary
source such as: the application in response to the notice of funding availability; the terms of the notice of funding
availability under which the application was solicited; the regulatory agreement; the loan commitment; the bid
invitation; the owner's management plan, or any other underwriting or financial document collected at or before
loan closing; 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
or
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Secondary sources.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Two or more sources of evidence such as: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
lease records from the earliest two years of occupancy for which records are available showing that occupancy has
been restricted primarily to households where the head, spouse or sole member is 62 years of age or older; evidence
that services for elderly persons have been provided, such as services funded by the Older Americans Act, transportation
to senior citizen centers, or programs coordinated with the Area Agency on Aging; project unit mix with a higher percentage
of efficiency and one-bedroom units [a secondary source particularly relevant to distinguishing elderly projects
under the previous section 3(b) definition (in which disabled families were included in the definition of ``elderly
families'') from non-elderly projects and which in combination with other factors (such as the number of accessible
units) may be useful in distinguishing projects for seniors from those serving the broader definition of ``elderly
families'' which includes disabled families]; or any other relevant type of historical data, unless clearly contradicted
by other comparable evidence. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Sources in conflict.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 If a primary source establishes a design contrary to that established by the primary source upon which the owner would
base support that the project is an eligible project (as defined in this section), the owner cannot make the election
of preferences for elderly families as provided by this section based upon primary sources alone. In any case where
the primary sources do not provide clear evidence of original design of the project for occupancy primarily by elderly
families, including those cases where primary documents conflict, secondary sources may be used to establish the
use for which the project was originally designed.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Reservation of units in elderly projects for non-elderly disabled families.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The owner of an elderly project is required to reserve, at a minimum, the number of units specified in paragraph (c)(1)
of this section for occupancy by disabled families who are not elderly or near-elderly families (hereafter, collectively
referred to ``non-elderly disabled families'').

 The owner, at the owner's option, and at any time, may reserve a greater number of units for non-elderly disabled families
than that provided for in paragraph (c)(1) of this section. The option to provide a greater number of units to non-elderly
disabled families will not obligate the owner to always provide that greater number to non-elderly disabled families.
The number of units required to be provided to non-elderly disabled families at any time in an elderly project is that

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Office of Thrift Supervision (OTS) proposes to amend its regulations governing mutual to stock conversions and
stock issuances by savings association subsidiaries of mutual holding companies (MHC stock offerings). The proposed
amendment requires the OTS, in connection with its review of conversion applications and MHC stock offering applications,
to consider the extent to which the transaction will affect the convenience and needs of the communities to be served
by the applicant. Under the proposal, in determining whether to approve these types of applications, the OTS will
consider the applicant's record of compliance with the Community Reinvestment Act (CRA) and other factors relating
to the convenience and needs of the communities served by the applicant.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The OTS recently has undertaken a comprehensive review of its conversion regulations. By Order No. 94&hyph;48, dated
April 7, 1994, the OTS adopted significant amendments to its mutual to stock conversion regulations, 12 CFR part 563b,
and mutual holding company regulations, 12 CFR part 575, to revise, update and clarify the regulations in a number
of areas. In connection with its review of the conversion regulations, one of the issues the OTS considered was whether
the convenience and needs of the local communities should be a factor in determining whether to approve these conversions.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The reasons for mutual associations' conversion to stock form have changed over the years. During the 1980s, most
mutual savings associations were marginally capitalized and many were insolvent. During this period, conversion
transactions were a primary method for undercapitalized savings associations to raise capital and avoid being closed
by the regulators. The conversion enabled an association to stay in business and continue to serve the community's
credit needs.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Now, however, most mutual associations are healthy. While a relatively small number of capital deficient mutual
associations undertake conversions primarily to recapitalize, most healthy mutual thrifts now convert for other
reasons. These reasons include financing the expansion of their operations and taking advantage of the benefits
available to a public company, such as the ability to establish stock benefit plans for management and employees.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The OTS is aware that account holders and consumer groups recently have voiced significant concerns regarding the
conversion of well-capitalized associations, particularly in light of the compensation and stock benefits that
management typically receives in such transactions. Such groups also have expressed concerns regarding the proper
deployment of conversion proceeds, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
i.e.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, the extent to which the capital raised in such transactions should be used to support credit and loan programs and
related services tailored to the community's credit needs. In addition, management of many well-capitalized converting
associations recently have expressed concern to the OTS that their institutions do not need_or are unable efficiently
to deploy_substantial amounts of the capital required to be raised under current regulations.
<FOOTCITE>1</FOOTCITE>
 Managers of such associations also have voiced concern about the negative impact of what they view as ``excess capital''
on the price/earnings ratio of the converted association's stock.

</FOOTNOTE>

The OTS is responding to these concerns by issuing an interim final regulation that, among other things, restricts
management benefit plans and requires converting institutions to file with the OTS a business plan that adequately
addresses the deployment of conversion proceeds.

 The interim rule, which appears elsewhere in this issue of the

which comment is specifically sought, and as to any other current provisions of the conversion regulations as they
relate to the interim rule.

 Upon review of this area, however, the OTS is proposing to apply a convenience and needs standard to these transactions
for the reasons discussed below.

A convenience and needs standard is already being applied to mutual holding company reorganizations because these
transactions require the OTS's approval under the Bank Merger Act (BMA). See 58 FR 44105 (August 19, 1993) (adopting
part 575 governing mutual holding company reorganizations and related stock issuances). The BMA requires that the
responsible agency consider the convenience and needs of the community to be served in acting on any BMA application.
See 12 U.S.C. 1828(c)(5). Because mutual holding company reorganizations and stock issuances to date generally
have been effected simultaneously as a two part transaction, the OTS has, as a practical matter, reviewed the entire
transaction under a convenience and needs standard.

First, the OTS has broad authority under sections 5(i)(1) and 5(i)(2) of the Home Owners' Loan Act (HOLA) to regulate
mutual to stock conversions by savings associations, and under section 10(o)(7) of the HOLA to regulate mutual holding
companies.
<FOOTCITE>4</FOOTCITE>
 These authorities give the agency considerable discretion in reviewing a conversion application or MHC stock offering
application. For example, the OTS has exercised this authority to determine whether a transaction is in the best interests
of depositors, the association and the Savings Association Insurance Fund.
<FOOTCITE>5</FOOTCITE>
 The OTS believes that inherent in this broad grant of authority is the ability to assess the impact of a proposed transaction
on the convenience and needs of the communities to be served by a savings association.

Second, section 4(a)(3) of the HOLA supports the adoption of the proposed regulations addressing housing credit
needs.
<FOOTCITE>6</FOOTCITE>
 Section 4(a)(3) of the HOLA provides that the Director ``shall exercise all powers granted to the Director under this
chapter so as to encourage savings associations to provide credit for housing safely and soundly.'' The powers granted
to the Director include the general regulatory authority under sections 5(i)(1), 5(i)(2), and 10(o)(7) of the HOLA
mentioned above. Because savings associations are predominantly housing lenders, the admonition in section 4(a)(3)
of the HOLA that the Director use his or her statutory powers to encourage savings associations to provide credit for
housing provides a substantial additional basis for the Director to assess community needs when reviewing applications.

Third, the OTS believes it is appropriate to apply a convenience and needs standard to conversion transactions and
MHC stock offerings as a part of the OTS's responsibility to consider the ongoing CRA performance of savings associations.
The CRA expresses Congress's judgment that regulated financial institutions must demonstrate that their deposit
facilities serve the convenience and needs of the communities in which they are chartered to do business and that regulated
financial institutions have continuing and affirmative obligations to help meet the credit needs of those local
communities.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In this regard, the federal banking agencies recently conducted a comprehensive review of their CRA regulations
in order to provide clearer guidance to financial institutions on the nature and extent of their CRA obligations,
the methods by which their performance will be assessed, and the manner in which the CRA will be enforced. This review
was undertaken in response to the President's July 1993 request that the federal financial institution supervisory
agencies reform the CRA examination and enforcement system. The President asked, among other things, that in undertaking
this effort, the regulators seek to promote consistency and even-handedness, to improve CRA performance evaluations
and to institute more effective sanctions against institutions with consistently poor CRA performance.
<FOOTCITE>8</FOOTCITE>
 The addition of a convenience and needs factor to the mutual to stock conversion standards and the standards for MHC
stock offerings is wholly consistent with the larger Presidential and regulatory initiatives on the CRA.
<FOOTCITE>9</FOOTCITE>
 The OTS's assessment of the CRA performance record of each association that is subject to the regulations promulgated
under sections 5(i) and 10(o) of the HOLA furthers its responsibility under section 4(a)(3) of the HOLA to encourage
thrifts to provide housing credit safely and soundly.

To implement the President's initiative, the four agencies held a series of seven public hearings across the country,
and amendments to the agencies' CRA regulations were proposed on December 21, 1993. See 58 FR 67466 (December 21, 1993).

In connection with its review of the CRA and its implementing regulations, the OTS also concluded that the CRA, by its
terms, requires the OTS to consider the CRA record of an association proposing to convert from mutual to

 stock form because the association must receive a new federal stock charter to replace its previous mutual charter.

See also section 5(a) of the HOLA, 12 U.S.C. 1464(a). Section 5(a) of the HOLA provides that the lending and other powers
conferred on federal savings associations under section 5 are intended to encourage provision of credit for housing
safely and soundly. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
</FOOTNOTE>

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposed convenience and needs standard, like the convenience and needs standards governing transactions subject
to the Bank Merger Act,
<FOOTCITE>11</FOOTCITE>
 certain holding company applications,
<FOOTCITE>12</FOOTCITE>
 and certain non-routine corporate transactions under current OTS regulations,
<FOOTCITE>13</FOOTCITE>
 is intended to encourage savings associations to devote their resources to lending programs and related customer
services that are designed to address the credit needs of their local communities, including low- and moderate-income
communities, consistent with safety and soundness. Such programs and services are an integral part of a mutual association's
traditional role of providing ``credit for housing,'' as envisioned by section 4(a)(3) of the HOLA. Thus, the OTS
believes the proposed regulations will enhance the OTS's ability to ensure that savings associations undertaking
these transactions recognize their responsibility to consider their community's credit needs.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposal would add a new &sect;563b.11 to the OTS conversion regulations that would require the OTS, in reviewing
a conversion application, to examine the extent to which the proposed conversion will affect the convenience and
needs of the communities to be served by the converted savings association. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As part of this examination, the OTS will review the applicant's record under the CRA regulations at 12 CFR part 563e
and related CRA policies. Under the proposal, the OTS would give substantial weight to an applicant's previous CRA
record, consistent with the long-standing policy of the OTS.
<FOOTCITE>14</FOOTCITE>
 For example, if an applicant in its most recent CRA examination received a rating of ``substantial noncompliance,''
<FOOTCITE>15</FOOTCITE>
 the OTS likely would not approve the application.

Under the proposal, the OTS also would scrutinize the business plans of the applicant. Applicants must demonstrate
that their plans for deployment of proceeds will help meet the credit and lending needs of the communities served by
the applicant. Under the proposed convenience and needs standard, where an applicant's business plan does not adequately
address this issue, the OTS may deny the application or impose additional conditions of approval. While commitments
in an applicant's business plan to allocate resources to community development projects or credit-related programs
generally indicate responsiveness to the convenience and needs of the community, the OTS will not necessarily view
such commitments as remedying CRA-related deficiencies. Performance under those commitments, however, would
be considered in evaluating the association's CRA record. The OTS also will consider other relevant factors relating
to the association's performance in meeting the convenience and needs of the community. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

The proposal also would add a new &sect;575.7(a)(7) to the OTS's mutual holding company regulations, and renumber
current &sect;575.7(a)(7) as 575.7(a)(8). The proposed new section would set forth an additional approval requirement
for stock issuances by a savings association subsidiary of a mutual holding company, requiring that the transaction
meet the convenience and needs standard of proposed &sect;563b.11.

In reviewing an application under this subpart, the Office will examine the extent to which the conversion will affect
the convenience and needs of the communities to be served by the converted savings association. The Office will review
the applicant's record under part 563e of this subchapter. In addition, the Office will scrutinize the business plan
of the applicant. Each applicant must demonstrate that the proposed deployment of proceeds contained in its business
plan will help meet the credit and lending needs of the communities served by the applicant. Also, the Office will consider
other relevant factors relating to the association's performance in meeting the convenience and needs of the community.
Based on an assessment of the applicant's record under part 563e of this subchapter, the applicant's business plan
and other relevant factors, the Office may approve the application, deny the application, or approve the application
on the condition that the applicant improve certain aspects of its CRA performance record or address particular credit
or lending needs of the communities that it serves.

SUMMARY: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
This document proposes special conditions for the Learjet Inc. (Lear) Model 45 airplane. This new airplane will utilize
new avionics/electronic systems that provide critical data to the flightcrew. The applicable regulations do not
contain adequate or appropriate safety standards for the protection of these systems from the effects of lightning
and high-intensity radiated fields. These proposed special conditions contain the additional safety standards
that the Administrator considers necessary to establish a level of safety equivalent to that established by the existing
airworthiness standards.

Background
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
On January 27, 1992, Learjet Inc. (Lear), 8220 West Harry Street, Wichita, KS 67209&hyph;2942, P.O. Box 7707, Wichita,
KS 67277&hyph;7707, applied for a new type certificate in the transport airplane category for the Model 45 airplane.
The Learjet Model 45 is a T-tail, low wing, medium sized business jet powered by two Garrett TFE 731&hyph;20 turbofan
engines mounted on pylons extending from the aft fuselage. Each engine will be capable of delivering 3,500 lbs. thrust
(3,650 lbs. thrust with auto performance reserve). The airplane will be capable of operating with two flight crewmembers
and a maximum of ten passengers (standard is eight passengers).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=2 -->
Type Certification Basis
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
Under the provisions of &sect;21.17 of the FAR, Learjet must show, except as provided in &sect;25.2, that the Model
45 meets the applicable provisions of part 25, effective February 1, 1965, as amended by Amendments 25&hyph;1 through
25&hyph;75. In addition, the proposed certification basis for the Model 45 includes part 34, effective September
10, 1990, plus any amendments in effect at the time of certification; and part 36, effective December 1, 1969, as amended
by Amendments 36&hyph;1 through the amendment in effect at the time of certification. The special conditions that
may be developed as a result of this notice will form an additional part of the type certification basis. In addition,
the certification basis may include other special conditions that are not relevant to these proposed special conditions.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If the Administrator finds that the applicable airworthiness regulations (i.e., part 25, as amended) do not contain
adequate or appropriate safety standards for the Learjet Model 45 because of a novel or unusual design feature, special
conditions are prescribed under the provisions of &sect;21.16 to establish a level of safety equivalent to that established
in the regulations.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Special conditions, as appropriate, are issued in accordance with &sect;11.49 of the FAR after public notice, as
required by &sect;&sect;11.28 and 11.29, and become part of the type certification basis in accordance with &sect;21.17(a)(2).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Special conditions are initially applicable to the model for which they are issued. Should the type certificate for
that model be amended later to include any other model that incorporates the same novel or unusual design feature,
or should any other model already included on the same type certificate be modified to incorporate the same novel or
unusual design feature, the special conditions would also apply to the other model under the provisions of &sect;21.101(a)(1).

Novel or Unusual Design Features
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
The Model 45 incorporates new avionic/electronic installations, including primary flight displays, an electronically
controlled braking system, digital electronic engine controls, an engine indication and crew alerting system (EICAS),
multifunction display, and a digital autopilot/flight director system. These systems may be vulnerable to lightning
and high-intensity radiated fields external to the airplane.

Discussion
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
The existing lightning protection airworthiness certification requirements are insufficient to provide an acceptable
level of safety with new technology avionic and electronic systems. There are two regulations that specifically
pertain to lightning protection: one for the airframe in general (&sect;25.581), and the other for fuel system protection
(&sect;25.954). There are, however, no regulations that deal specifically with protection of electrical and electronic
systems from lightning. The loss of a critical function of these systems due to lightning would prevent continued
safe flight and landing of the airplane. Although the loss of an essential function would not prevent continued safe
flight and landing, it could significantly impact the safety level of the airplane.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
There is also no specific regulation that addresses protection requirements for electrical and electronic systems
from HIRF. Increased power levels from ground based radio transmitters and the growing use of sensitive electrical
and electronic systems to command and control airplanes have made it necessary to provide adequate protection.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
To ensure that a level of safety is achieved equivalent to that intended by the regulations incorporated by reference,
special conditions are proposed for the Lear Model 45, which would require that new technology electrical and electronic
systems be designed and installed to preclude component damage and interruption of function due to both the direct
and indirect effects of lightning and HIRF.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

Lightning
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
To provide a means of compliance with these proposed special conditions, clarification of the threat definition
of lightning is needed. The following ``threat definition,'' based on FAA Advisory Circular 20&hyph;136, Protection
of Aircraft Electrical/Electronics Systems Against the Indirect Effects of Lightning, dated March 5, 1990, is proposed
as a basis to use in demonstrating compliance with the lightning protection special condition, with the exception
of the multiple burst environment, which has been changed to agree with the latest recommendation from the Society
of Automotive Engineers (SAE) AE4L lightning committee.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The lightning current waveforms (Components A, D, and H) defined below, along with the voltage waveforms in AC 20&hyph;53A,
will provide a consistent and reasonable standard that is acceptable for use in evaluating the effects of lightning
on the airplane. These waveforms depict threats that are external to the airplane. The effect of these threats on the
airplane and its systems depends upon several factors, including installation configuration, materials, shielding,
airplane geometry, etc. Therefore, test (including tests on the completed airplane or an adequate simulation) and/or
verified analyses need to be conducted in order to obtain the resultant internal threat to the installed systems.
The electronic systems may then be evaluated with this internal threat in order to determine their susceptibility
to upset and/or malfunction.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
To evaluate the induced effects to these systems, three considerations are required:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
First Return Stroke:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (Severe Strike_Component A, or Restrike-Component D). This external threat needs to be evaluated to obtain the resultant
internal threat and to verify that the level of the induced currents and voltages is sufficiently below the equipment
``hardness'' level.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Multiple Stroke Flash:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (1/2 Component D). A lightning strike is often composed of a number of successive strokes, referred to as multiple
strokes. Although multiple strokes are not necessarily a salient factor in a damage assessment, they can be the primary
factor in a system upset analysis. Multiple strokes can induce a sequence of transients over an extended period of
time. While a single event upset of input/output signals may not affect system performance, multiple signal upsets
over an extended period of time (2 seconds) may affect the systems under consideration. Repetitive pulse testing
and/or analysis needs to be carried out in response to the multiple stroke environment to demonstrate that the system
response meets the safety objective. This external multiple stroke environment consists of 24 pulses and is described
as a single Component A followed by 23 randomly spaced restrikes of 1/2 magnitude of Component D (peak amplitude of
50,000 amps). The 23 restrikes are distributed over a period of up to 2 seconds according to the following constraints:
(1) The minimum time between subsequent strokes is 10ms, and (2) the maximum time between subsequent strokes is 200ms.
An analysis or test needs to be accomplished in order to obtain the resultant internal threat environment for the system
under evaluation.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Multiple Burst:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (Component H). In-flight data gathering projects have shown bursts of multiple, low amplitude, fast rates of rise,
short duration pulses accompanying the airplane lightning strike process. While insufficient energy exists in
these pulses to cause physical damage, it is possible that transients resulting from this environment may cause upset
to some digital processing systems.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The representation of this interference environment is a repetition of short duration, low amplitude, high peak
rate of rise, double exponential pulses that represent the multiple bursts of current pulses observed in these flight
data gathering projects. This component is intended for an analytical (or test) assessment of functional upset of
the system. Again, it is necessary that this component be translated into an internal environmental threat in order
to be used. This ``Multiple Burst'' consists of repetitive Component H waveforms in 3 sets of 20 pulses each. The minimum
time between individual Component H pulses within a burst is 50 microseconds, the maximum is 1,000 microseconds.
The 3 bursts are distributed according to the following constraints: (1) The minimum period between bursts is 30ms,
and (2) the maximum period between bursts is 300ms. The individual ``Multiple Burst'' Component H waveform is defined
below.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The following current waveforms constitute the ``Severe Strike'' (Component A), ``Restrike'' (Component D), ``Multiple
Stroke'' (1/2 Component D), and the ``Multiple Burst'' (Component H).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
These components are defined by the following double exponential equation:

High-Intensity Radiated Fields (HIRF)
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
With the trend toward increased power levels from ground based transmitters, plus the advent of space and satellite
communications, coupled with electronic command and control of the airplane, the immunity of critical digital avionics
systems to HIRF must be established.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
It is not possible to precisely define the HIRF to which the airplane will be exposed in service. There is also uncertainty
concerning the effectiveness of airframe shielding for HIRF. Furthermore, coupling of electromagnetic energy
to cockpit-installed equipment through the cockpit window apertures is undefined. Based on surveys and analysis
of existing HIRF emitters, an adequate level of protection exists when compliance with the HIRF protection special
condition is shown with either paragraphs 1 or 2 below:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. A minimum threat of 100 volts per meter peak electric field strength from 10 KHz to 18 GHz.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a. The threat must be applied to the system elements and their associated wiring harnesses without the benefit of airframe
shielding.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
b. Demonstration of this level of protection is established through system tests and analysis.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. A threat external to the airframe of the following field strengths for the frequency ranges indicated.

The envelope given in paragraph 2 above is a revision to the envelope used in previously issued special conditions
in other certification projects. It is based on new data and SAE AE4R subcommittee recommendations. This revised
envelope includes data from Western Europe and the U.S.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As discussed above, the proposed special conditions would be applicable initially to the Learjet Model 45. Should
Learjet apply at a later date for a change to the type certificate to include another model incorporating the same novel

SUMMARY:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 This notice proposes the supersedure o

f an existing airworthiness directive (AD), applicable to General Electric Company (GE) CF6&hyph;45/&hyph;50/
<!-- PJG 0034 unknown -->
&hyph;80A series turbofan engines, that currently requires a one-time ultrasonic and eddy current inspection of
the high pressure compressor rotor (HPCR) stage 3&hyph;9 spool for cracks. This action would retain the inspection
requirements of the current AD, but would accelerate the inspection schedule, and introduce a repetitive inspection
requirement. This proposal is prompted by a review of the inspection results to date, which indicate that the crack
occurrence rate is higher than initially projected. The actions specified by the proposed AD are intended to prevent
an uncontained HPCR stage 3&hyph;9 spool failure, which could result in damage to the aircraft.

Discussion 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
On October 25, 1991, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) issued airworthiness directive (AD) 91&hyph;20&hyph;01,
Amendment 39&hyph;8035 (56 FR 55230), to require a one-time ultrasonic and eddy current inspection of the high pressure
compressor rotor (HPCR) stage 3&hyph;9 spool for cracks. That action was prompted by two reports of spools found cracked
in service. That condition, if not corrected, could result in an uncontained HPCR stage 3&hyph;9 spool failure, which
could result in damage to the aircraft. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Since the issuance of that AD, the FAA has received reports of five additional spools found cracked in service. Investigation
indicates that the cracks initiated in sub-surface origins in the stage 9 bore region of the spool. These cracks form
from metallurgical anomalies that result from reduced forging work associated with the sixteen inch billet material
used in the manufacture of certain HPCR stage 3&hyph;9 spools. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Based on the investigation findings, and the higher than projected crack occurrence rates, the FAA has determined
that the inspection schedule in the current AD should be accelerated, and a repetitive inspection requirement be
implemented. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FAA has reviewed and approved the technical contents of GE CF6&hyph;50 Service Bulletin (SB) No. 72&hyph;1000,
Revision 2, dated September 9, 1993, and GE CF6&hyph;80A SB No. 72&hyph;583, Revision 4, dated September 15, 1993,
which describe procedures for the ultrasonic and eddy current inspection of the HPCR stage 3&hyph;9 spool. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Since an unsafe condition has been identified that is likely to exist or develop on other products of this same type
design, the proposed AD would supersede AD 91&hyph;20&hyph;01, would retain the one-time ultrasonic and eddy current
inspection of the HPCR stage 3&hyph;9 spool for cracks as required in the current AD, but would accelerate the inspection

There are approximately 462 GE CF6&hyph;45/&hyph;50/&hyph;80A series engines of the affected design in the worldwide
fleet. The FAA estimates that 67 engines installed in aircraft of U.S. registry would be affected by the proposed AD,
that it would take approximately 584 work hours per engine to accomplish the proposed actions, and that the average
labor rate is $55 per work hour. Required parts would cost approximately $127,412 per engine. Based on these figures,
and assuming that 3 of the inspected spools will require replacement, the total cost impact of the proposed AD on U.S.
operators is estimated to be $2,534,276.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The regulations proposed herein would not have substantial direct effects on the States, on the relationship between
the national government and the States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels
of government. Therefore, in accordance with Executive Order 12612, it is determined that this proposal would not
have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For the reasons discussed above, I certify that this proposed regulation: (1) Is not a ``major rule'' under Executive
Order 12291; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under the DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034, February
26, 1979); and (3) if promulgated, will not have a significant economic impact, positive or negative, on a substantial
number of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act. A copy of the draft regulatory evaluation
prepared for this action is contained in the Rules Docket. A copy of it may be obtained by contacting the Rules Docket

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 This document proposes the adoption of a new airworthiness directive (AD) that is applicable to certain Saab Model
SAAB SF340A and SAAB 340B airplanes. This proposal would require repetitive inspections to detect cracking of the
tray stop spindle and backrest spindle bosses on the inboard sections of certain seats; and replacement of the inboard
sections, if necessary. This proposal would also require repair and identification of the modification plate, which
would terminate the requirement to inspect repetitively. This proposal is prompted by reports of fatigue cracking
in the vicinity of the tray stop spindle and backrest spindle bosses, which could lead to excessive movement and eventual
failure of the backrest on these seats during aft loading. The actions specified by the proposed AD are intended to
prevent failure of the backrest on these seats, which could inhibit emergency egress.

Discussion 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Civil Aviation Authority (CAA), which is the airworthiness authority for the United Kingdom, recently notified
the FAA that an unsafe condition may exist on certain Flight Equipment and Engineering Limited (FEEL) Model 121 series
seats that are installed on Saab Model SAAB SF340A and SAAB 340B airplanes. The CAA advises that several operators
of Saab Model SAAB SF340A and SAAB SF340B airplanes found fatigue cracking in the vicinity of the tray stop spindle
and backrest spindle bosses. Cracking in this area may weaken the machined component that attaches the backrest of
the seats to the main spars of the airplane and may lead to excessive movement and eventual failure of the backrest on
these seats during aft loading. This condition, if not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
corrected, could result in failure of the backrest of these seats, which could inhibit emergency egress. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FEEL has issued Service Bulletin 25&hyph;20&hyph;1287, Revision 3, dated March 1993, that describes procedures
for a detailed visual inspection to detect cracking of the tray stop spindle and backrest spindle bosses on the inboard
section of certain Model 121 series seats; replacement of the inboard section with a section having the same part number,
if necessary, and repetitively inspecting; and identification of the newly installed section. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FEEL has also issued Service Bulletin 25&hyph;20&hyph;1294, Revision 1, dated May 1993, that describes procedures
for repair by replacing the inboard section of certain Model 121 series seats with a newly designed, stronger inboard
section, and replacing the front beam with a serviceable beam, if necessary; and identification of the newly installed
section. This repair and identification procedure would eliminate the need to inspect the inboard sections repetitively.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The CAA classified these service bulletins as mandatory and issued CAA Airworthiness Directives 006&hyph;03&hyph;93
and 017&hyph;03&hyph;93 in order to assure the continued airworthiness of these airplanes in the United Kingdom.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This airplane model is manufactured in Sweden and is type certificated for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
operation in the United States under the provisions of &sect;21.29 of the Federal Aviation Regulations and the applicable
bilateral airworthiness agreement. Pursuant to this bilateral airworthiness agreement, the CAA has kept the FAA
informed of the situation described above. The FAA has examined the findings of the CAA, reviewed all available information,
and determined that AD action is necessary for products of this type design that are certificated for operation in
the United States. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Since an unsafe condition has been identified that is likely to exist or develop on other airplanes of the same type
design registered in the United States, the proposed AD would require a detailed visual inspection to detect cracking
of the tray stop spindle and backrest spindle bosses on the inboard section of certain Model 121 series seats; replacement
of the inboard sections with sections having the same part number and repetitively inspecting, if necessary; and
identification of the newly installed section. This proposal would require repair (including the installation
of stronger inboard sections) and identification of the stronger inboard sections (accomplishment of the actions
specified in FEEL Service Bulletin 25&hyph;20&hyph;1294), which would terminate the requirement to inspect repetitively.
The actions would be required to be accomplished in accordance with the service bulletins described previously.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FAA estimates that 73 airplanes of U.S. registry would be affected by this proposed AD, that it would take approximately
2 work hours (1 work hour per seat to inspect and 1 work hour per seat to replace, with 34 seats per airplane) to accomplish
the proposed actions, and that the average labor rate is $55 per work hour. Required parts would be provided by the manufacturer
at no cost to the operator. Based on these figures, the total cost impact of the proposed AD on U.S. operators is estimated
to be $273,020, or $3,740 per airplane. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The total cost impact figure discussed above is based on assumptions that no operator has yet accomplished any of the
proposed requirements of this AD action, and that no operator would accomplish those actions in the future if this
AD were not adopted. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The regulations proposed herein would not have substantial direct effects on the States, on the relationship between
the national government and the States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels
of government. Therefore, in accordance with Executive Order 12612, it is determined that this proposal would not
have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For the reasons discussed above, I certify that this proposed regulation: (1) Is not a ``significant regulatory action''
under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under the DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44
FR 11034, February 26, 1979); and (3) if promulgated, will not have a significant economic impact, positive or negative,
on a substantial number of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act. A copy of the draft
regulatory evaluation prepared for this action is contained in the Rules Docket. A copy of it may be obtained by contacting
the Rules Docket at the location provided under the caption

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
On February 9, 1994, the Commission published proposed rule 17a&hyph;23 under the Act.
<FOOTCITE>1</FOOTCITE>
 The proposal would establish a uniform recordkeeping and reporting structure for broker-dealer sponsors of broker-dealer
trading systems, requiring those broker-dealer sponsors to make available to the Commission and the appropriate
self-regulatory organization (``SRO''), system-specific information about activity occurring in those systems.
The Commission is extending the comment period on the proposal from April 19, 1994 to May 19, 1994 in order to receive
the benefit of comments from the greatest possible number of interested persons.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
</FOOTNOTE>

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposal raises a number of complex issues with respect to the regulation of broker-dealer trading systems, including
the consistency of the proposal with the policies underlying the Act and the appropriate scope of the requirements
imposed under the proposal. The Commission has received only two comments on the proposal to date. Accordingly, the
Commission is concerned that the current comment period may not permit interested persons sufficient time to address
these issues in a thorough manner.
<FOOTCITE>2</FOOTCITE>
 Moreover, the lack of a sufficient volume of comments to comprise an adequate record potentially undermines the quality
of any determination the Commission ultimately may make with respect to the proposal.
<FOOTCITE>3</FOOTCITE>
 Accordingly, in order to receive the benefit of comments from the greatest possible number of interested persons,
the Commission is extending the comment period on the proposal from April 19, 1994 to May 19, 1994.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->
The Commission's experience with proposed rule 15c2&hyph;10 under the Act, which the Commission recently withdrew
(Securities Exchange Act Release No. 33621 [February 14, 1994], 59 FR 8379), indicates that an extension of time may
assist interested persons in formulating their views and help ensure that the Commission is provided with an adequate
record. Proposed rule 15c2&hyph;10 would have established a comprehensive regulatory framework for certain automated
securities trading systems that are not operated as facilities of national securities exchanges or associations.
The Commission twice extended the comment period on proposed rule 15c2&hyph;10, for a total of 45 days (from June 19
to August 2, 1989). The Commission received 17 comments on its proposal. However, only five of those 17 comments were
received during the initial comment period; the remaining 12 comments were submitted during the subsequent 45-day
extended period. If the same pattern holds with respect to the current proposal, extension of the comment period could
provide the Commission with a substantial number of additional comments upon which to base its determination.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Background
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
Section 103(a) generally provides that the interest on obligations of a State or political subdivision thereof is
excluded from gross income. Section 103(b)(1) provides, however, that section 103(a) does not apply to any private
activity bond unless the bond is a qualified bond. Section 141(e) defines a qualified bond to include an exempt facility
bond which, under section 142(a)(5), includes an issue at least 95 percent of the net proceeds of which are used to provide
sewage facilities.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Until the Tax Reform Act of 1986 (1986 Act), both sewage disposal facilities and water pollution control facilities
constituted exempt facilities under former sections 103(b)(4)(E) and 103(b)(4)(F), respectively, the predecessors
to existing section 142. Section 1.103&hyph;8(f)(2)(i) defines sewage disposal facilities to mean any property
used for the collection, storage, treatment, utilization, processing, or final disposal of sewage.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The 1986 Act eliminated the exempt facility exemptions for air and water pollution control facilities, while retaining
the exemption for sewage disposal facilities (renamed sewage facilities by the 1986 Act) under section 142(a)(5).
Neither section 142 nor the regulations issued under section 103(b)(4) define sewage. As a result, it has become important
to define the facilities eligible for private activity bond financing as sewage facilities under section 142(a)(5).

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=2 -->
Definition of Sewage Facility
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
The proposed regulations define a sewage facility for purposes of section 142(a)(5). A facility may satisfy the definition
of a sewage facility regardless whether wastewater originates from a domestic, a commercial, or an industrial source.
The proposed regulations, in effect, generally distinguish between sewage treatment facilities and water pollution
control facilities. The proposed regulations define sewage facilities by reference to the operations historically
performed at most publicly-owned treatment works (POTW). On the other hand, because toxic, priority, and nonconventional
pollutants are more in the nature of water pollutants, the regulations consider treatment of these pollutants as
ordinarily not performed in sewage facilities.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed regulations provide that sewage facilities include property used for the secondary treatment of wastewater
but only to the extent the treatment is for wastewater having an average daily raw wasteload concentration of biochemical
oxygen demand (BOD) that does not exceed 350 milligrams per liter as oxygen. Thus, to the extent the wastewater treated
by the property has an average daily raw wasteload concentration of BOD exceeding 350 milligrams per liter as oxygen,
then the property used for the secondary treatment of the excess is not a sewage facility. The limitation is intended
to reasonably approximate the upper limit of the average daily raw wasteload concentration for most POTWs.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed regulations further provide that any property used for the preliminary and/or primary treatment of
wastewater used in connection with secondary treatment qualifies as a sewage facility. Sewage facilities also include
related property used for the collection, storage, use, processing, or final disposal of wastewater or sewage sludge
and property functionally related and subordinate to a sewage facility.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Generally, other treatment of wastewater is not sewage treatment. Thus, for example, sewage facilities, including
functionally related and subordinate property, do not include property used for the pretreatment, advanced treatment,
or tertiary treatment of wastewater, whether or not the treatment is necessary for preliminary, primary, or secondary
treatment.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For property that has both a sewage treatment function and another function, such as pretreatment or, in certain cases,
secondary treatment of wastewater having an average daily raw wasteload concentration of BOD in excess of 350 milligrams
per liter as oxygen, the proposed regulations provide an allocation rule to permit the portion of the property allocable
to sewage treatment to be financed as part of an exempt facility issue.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The IRS solicits comments on how best to address technological advances to wastewater treatment processes within
the definition of sewage facilities.

Special Analyses 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
It has been determined that this notice of proposed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
rulemaking is not a significant regulatory action as defined in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EO 12866. Therefore, a regulatory assessment is not required. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
It also has been determined that section 553(b) of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Administrative Procedure Act (5 U.S.C. chapter 5) and the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. chapter 6) do not apply to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
these regulations, and, therefore, a Regulatory Flexibility 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Analysis is not required. Pursuant to section 7805(f) of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Internal Revenue Code, this notice of proposed rulemaking will be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
submitted to the Chief Counsel for Advocacy of the Small Business 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Administration for comment on its impact on small business.

Comments and Public Hearing
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Before these proposed regulations are adopted as final 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
regulations, consideration will be given to any written comments 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(a signed original and eight (8) copies) that are submitted 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
timely to the IRS. All comments will be available for public 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
inspection and copying. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A public hearing has been scheduled for July 26, 1994, at 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
10 a.m., in the Commissioner's Conference Room, Internal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Revenue Building, room 3313, 1111 Constitution Avenue, NW., 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Washington, DC. Because of access restrictions, visitors will 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
not be admitted beyond the Internal Revenue Building lobby more 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
than 15 minutes before the hearing starts. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The rules of 26 CFR 601.601(a)(3) apply to the hearing. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Persons that wish to present oral comments at the hearing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
must submit written comments and an outline of the topics to be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
discussed and the time to be devoted to each topic (signed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
original and eight (8) copies) by July 5, 1994. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A period of 10 minutes will be allotted to each person for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
making comments. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
An agenda showing the scheduling of the speakers will be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
prepared after the deadline for receiving outlines has passed. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Copies of the agenda will be available free of charge at the

sewage facility.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Property other than property described in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
paragraph (b)(1) of this section is not a sewage facility. Thus, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for example, property is not a sewage facility, or functionally 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
related and subordinate property, if the property is used for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
pretreatment, advanced treatment, or tertiary treatment of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
wastewater (whether or not this treatment is necessary to perform 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
preliminary, primary, or secondary treatment), or the related 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
collection, storage, use, processing, or final disposal of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
wastewater. In addition, property used to treat, process, or use 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
wastewater subsequent to the time the wastewater can be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
discharged into navigable waters is not a sewage facility. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

Allocation of costs.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 In the case of property that has 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
both a use described in paragraph (b)(1) of this section 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(a sewage treatment function) and a use other than sewage 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
treatment, only the portion of the cost of the property allocable 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to the sewage treatment function is taken into account as an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
expenditure to provide sewage facilities. The portion of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
cost of property allocable to the sewage treatment function is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
determined by allocating the cost of that property between the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
property's sewage treatment function and any other uses by any 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
method which, based on all the facts and circumstances, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reasonably reflects a separation of costs for each use of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
property.

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Clean Air Act, as amended (the Act), authorizes EPA to implement a field citation program, as part of the Agency's
recently-granted authority for the administrative assessment of civil penalties.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Act authorizes EPA to issue field citations for appropriate minor violations, defined in today
<!-- PJG 0034 unknown -->
s proposal as those violations determined to be minor in nature after consideration of various specified factors.
EPA also proposes a maximum penalty of $5,000 per day for each violation cited, and a maximum cumulative penalty in
the range of $15,000 to $25,000 per citation.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Upon receipt of a field citation, a respondent must either pay the proposed penalty or submit a request for a hearing.
Hearing procedures are also proposed in this document. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA expects to implement this program such that in the great majority of cases the issuance of a field citation will
lead to a quick correction of a clear violation and a payment of the assessed penalty.

III. Background of Proposed Rule 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Prior to the passage of the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990,
<FOOTCITE>1</FOOTCITE>
 EPA enforced Clean Air Act provisions through civil or criminal judicial enforcement actions and the issuance of
administrative orders for compliance.
<FOOTCITE>2</FOOTCITE>
 The 1990 Amendments expanded EPA's range of enforcement tools by authorizing EPA to issue administrative penalty
orders (section 113(d)(1) of the Act) and to administratively assess civil penalties through field citations issued
for minor violations (section 113(d)(3) of the Act). EPA expects that these new enforcement options will enhance
the Agency's ability to enforce the Act. Where appropriate, EPA will be able to respond quickly to a violation by issuing
an administrative penalty order or a field citation, rather than commencing a civil judicial enforcement action
for penalties. While civil and criminal judicial enforcement actions will remain an important component of EPA's
enforcement program, EPA's new administrative authorities will enable it to effectively pursue a broad range of
violations without the expenditure of resources associated with judicial action.

Section 113(d)(3) of the Act authorizes EPA to implement a field citation program to enforce the Act through regulations
which establish appropriate minor violations for which field citations may be issued. The Act requires that the Agency
consult with the Attorney General and the States, that the maximum civil penalty for a minor violation not exceed $5,000
per day of violation, and that field citations be issued only by EPA officers or employees designated by the Administrator.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 113(d)(3) of the Act also provides that any person to whom a field citation is issued may elect either to pay
the proposed penalty or to request a hearing in accordance with procedures specified in the regulations. It further
provides that the penalty assessed in the field citation becomes final if a request for a hearing is not made within
the time specified in the implementing regulations. The Act specifies that hearings shall not be subject to the requirements
of the Administrative Procedure Act (APA), 5 U.S.C. 554 or 556, but shall provide a reasonable opportunity to be heard
and to present evidence. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Act also specifies that payment of a field citation penalty shall not be a defense to further enforcement by the
United States or a State to correct a violation, or to assess the statutory maximum penalty pursuant to other authorities
in the Act, if the violation continues. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
IV. Program Considerations 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
A. Appropriate Minor Violations for Issuance of Field Citations 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
EPA expects the field citation program to exhibit several important characteristics. First, field citations should
be issued for violations that are clear cut and truly minor in nature. Second, field citations should, in general,
be issued shortly after a violation is discovered, if not upon discovery. Third, the amount of the penalty assessed
and other aspects of the program should induce quick correction of the violation and payment of the penalty. As required
by section 113(d)(3), EPA is proposing a definition of minor violation for which field citations may be issued. This
definition is designed to help implement these goals. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA considered several regulatory options for establishing appropriate minor violations as directed in the statute.
One option was inclusion in the rule of a comprehensive list of all possible violations suitable for field citations.
This approach would appear to have several advantages. Explicitly listing each minor violation in the rule would
provide clear, objective criteria for the issuance of field citations, thereby limiting inspector discretion.
An inspector would need only check the list of appropriate minor violations to determine whether a field citation
could be issued. This approach would appear to both streamline the program and help to achieve national consistency
in its application. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A major problem with this option became clear, however, when attempts were made to develop such a list of ``minor violations.''
Almost any violation might be considered significant or minor depending on the circumstances. A regulatory list
of all or nearly all possible minor violations would therefore be too long to be of any real use, or in the alternative,
would exclude violations which, given the right circumstances, would properly be considered minor.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In addition, it became clear that an exercise of discretion was almost unavoidable in determining whether a violation
was minor. This was inherent in the view that the specific circumstances, along with the kind of violation, were critical
in determining whether or not it was minor. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Thus, the option of listing all or nearly all minor violations in the regulations would result in a list that was either
too long or too short to be of significant value. It would also not provide a mechanism for channeling the exercise of
discretion that appears inherent in the decision on whether a violation is minor, and consequently would not appear
to foster national consistency. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A second option considered by EPA would define as minor those violations limited to particular categories of regulatory
requirements (e.g., recordkeeping, reporting, labeling, monitoring, workpractice standards, etc.). This option,
however, exhibits the same basic problems as the first option. Here again, violations within these broad categories
could be considered significant or minor depending on the circumstances. This second approach still did not provide
a method for determining when a violation in one of the broad categories would be considered minor. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Given the importance of the specific circumstances of a violation in categorizing it as significant or minor, EPA
considered and is today proposing a third option. In today
<!-- PJG 0034 unknown -->
s proposal a minor violation would be defined as one that is minor in nature, in light of a list of factors that must be
considered as a whole. This list contains such factors as whether the violation is readily recognizable by an officer
or employee of EPA; the risk and degree of environmental harm resulting from the violation; the time, effort, or expense
required to correct the violation; the frequency and duration of the violation; and the importance of the violated
requirement to the regulatory program. For example, determinations that the violation is manifest; that it poses
little risk of environmental harm; that it has not been identified in a previous enforcement action against the respondent;
that it occurred once or only for a short period of time; or that correcting it should require little time, effort, or
expense would be indicators of the minor nature of a violation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA recognizes that this list is not exhaustive of all factors that may be relevant to whether a violation is minor in
nature. Therefore, the definition includes a provision for consideration of other appropriate factors. However,
the list is indicative of the types of factors that EPA will consider in determining whether a violation is minor. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
While EPA considers these factors as relevant to determining whether or not a violation is minor in nature, information
may not be available on all of these factors when decisions are made regarding the propriety of issuing a field citation.
If information is not available for any of the factors noted in the proposed list of factors, then that factor would
be treated as neutral on the issue of whether a violation is minor in nature. In addition, EPA
<!-- PJG 0034 unknown -->
s proposal calls for evaluating the factors as a whole. Specific requirements are not proposed for each of the factors
individually, i.e., EPA has not proposed a specific time requirement for ``duration of violation'' or a dollar amount
for ``expense required to correct a violation.'' The specific circumstances of the violation would be considered
in light of all of these factors taken as a whole. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A final factor has been added to the definition of minor violation to make clear that EPA reserves all rights to determine
the appropriate enforcement response to a violation. A violation is not a minor violation under the definition proposed
today unless it is minor in nature as described above, and unless the Agency, in its descretion, decides to address
it as a minor violation. This is to make it clear that the field citation regulations proposed today do not provide a
basis for respondents to claim that an alleged violation is minor in nature and therefore EPA's only available enforcement
mechanism is issuance of a field citation. Today's proposed regulations are not intended to limit in any way EPA's
ability to fully exercise its enforcement discretion. The Agency reserves the right to determine what, if any, enforcement
approach is appropriate in a specific case. EPA believes this is consistent with Congressional intent for the field
citation program, as section 113(d)(3) provides that ``[t]he Administrator may implement *&blank;*&blank;* a
field citation program through regulations establishing appropriate minor violations for which field citations
*&blank;*&blank;* 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
may
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 be issued by officers or employees designated by the Administrator.'' (emphasis supplied)

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
It is important to note that there are circumstances under which EPA might conclude that a field citation is not the
most appropriate enforcement response. For example, if a person or source is the subject of an ongoing EPA investigation
or if a person or source has an aggregation of many minor violations, each of which, if considered individually, would
be suitable for a field citation, EPA may appropriately decide to address those violations through its section 113(d)
administrative penalty authority or through its section 113(b) civil judicial authority. A more detailed description
of the process for determining whether a violation is minor will be presented in the guidance document to be developed
for implementing this rule.

B. Maximum Penalty 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Under section 113(d)(3), civil penalties assessed in a field citation may not exceed ``$5,000 per day of violation.''
EPA proposes to interpret this provision such that the maximum $5,000 penalty applies for each day, for each separate
violation cited in the field citation. This interpretation is consistent with the statutory text and structure of
section 113, and is supported by its legislative history. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA's proposed interpretation of the phrase ``per day of violation'' as used in section 113(d)(3) is quite reasonable,
given EPA's long history of interpreting an identical penalty provision in this manner, the civil penalty provision
of section 113(b) as it stood prior to enactment of the 1990 amendments.
<FOOTCITE>3</FOOTCITE>
 That prior interpretation has found support in several judicial decisions.
<FOOTCITE>4</FOOTCITE>
 By using the same language as previously found in section 113(b), Congress clearly authorized EPA to continue this
interpretation for purposes of the new field citation program.

This interpretation is also consistent with Congress' apparent objectives for the field citation program as indicated
by various provisions in section 113 relating to field citations. Congress limited the field citation program to
``appropriate minor violations,'' established a maximum penalty amount of ``$5,000 per day of violation,'' provided
a right to a non-APA hearing, and required that penalties in this program be assessed after consideration of the penalty
assessment criteria of section 113(e). These provisions indicate that Congress wanted to provide EPA with a flexible
enforcement tool that would focus on the less significant, presumably simpler and less complex violations, with
assessment of significantly lower penalties than expected through two other civil penalty provisions of section
113, administrative penalty orders (section 113(d)(1)) and judicial civil penalty actions (section 113(b)). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA's proposed interpretation of the maximum penalty amount for the field citation program, $5,000 per day for each
violation, will lead to significantly lower penalty assessments in comparison to these other two programs, primarily
because of the large reduction in the maximum penalty from $25,000 to $5,000, the minor nature of the violations, and
the penalty assessment criteria in section 113(e). Interpreting ``per day of violation'' to mean per day for each
violation allows EPA to fairly and flexibly implement a field citation program in a manner consistent with Congress'
apparent objectives for this program. While a more restrictive interpretation, such as $5,000 per day of violation
no matter how many different violations on a specific day, might lead to even lower penalty assessments in certain
cases, Congress' apparent objectives for the field citation program can be met without adopting this approach. In
fact, a more restrictive interpretation might hinder implementation of these goals. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
First, an interpretation that ``per day of violation'' in section 113(d)(3) imposes a maximum penalty of $5,000 not
withstanding the number of violations in a day would in certain cases minimize if not remove the Agency's ability to
fully account for important differences between violators when assessing penalties under this program. Two violators
with different numbers of minor violations on the same day would both face the same maximum penalty, possibly removing
EPA's ability to reflect this difference in the amount of penalty imposed. This would appear to run counter to the requirement
in section 113(e) that EPA consider such differences when assessing penalties under section 113(d)(3). Second,
in that situation there would be an incentive for EPA to issue an administrative penalty order in lieu of a field citation,
to avoid the apparent unfairness resulting from the limitation in discretion embodied in the more restrictive interpretation.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
It is unlikely that Congress intended either of these results, and EPA's proposed interpretation avoids them without
in any way sacrificing full implementation of Congress' goals for this program. The Agency will be able to fully consider
all the factors required under section 113(e), including the number of violations, and the field citation program
will still involve significantly lower penalty amounts than the other civil penalty programs in section 113.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA's interpretation is supported by the legislative history in section 113(d)(3). The field citation provisions
finally adopted by Congress originated in the House of Representatives. While an early version of the provision called
for a maximum penalty of ``$5,000 per day for each violation,'' this was changed without explanation to a maximum penalty
of ``5,000 per day of violation.''
<FOOTCITE>5</FOOTCITE>
 While the House Committee Report fails to explain this change in language, it is important to note that the phrase ``per
day of violation'' had long been interpreted by the Agency as establishing a maximum civil penalty for each day, for
each separate violation. Various judicial decisions were consistent with this interpretation.
<FOOTCITE>6</FOOTCITE>
 Congress' adoption of language with a long-standing Agency interpretation is strong evidence that despite the difference
in language between section 113(a) and section 113(d)(3), Congress did not preclude EPA's proposed interpretation
but instead authorized the Agency to adopt the same interpretation for the field citation program that EPA had long
employed for the maximum penalty provision found in the pre-1990 version of section 113(a).

As originally introduced, the field citation program contained a limit of $5,000 ``per day for each violation.''
H.R. 3030, 101st Cong., 1st Sess. 283 (1989). A similar provision was employed for civil judicial penalties under
&sect;113(b) and the new authority for administrative penalty orders under &sect;113(d)(1). The Subcommittee
on Health and the Environment of the Committee on Energy and Commerce retained this provision for judicially imposed
civil penalties, but for the field citations program limited field citations to $5,000 ``per day of violation,''
adopting language from the judicial civil penalty provision in the then current Clean Air Act. House Subcommittee
on Health and the Environment, 101st Cong., 1st Sess. Amendment in the Nature of a Substitute of H.R. 3030 at 309 (Comm.
Print, November 9, 1989). This version of the field citation penalty provision was later reported out by the Committee,
adopted by the House and finally included in the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990. Pub. L. No. 101&hyph;549, 104 Stat.
2399 (1990).

The legislative history in the Senate also makes it clear that Congress intended to authorize EPA's proposed interpretation.
In the Senate, the bill reported out by the Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works authorized a field citation
program with a maximum civil penalty of ``$5,000 per day for each violation.''
<FOOTCITE>7</FOOTCITE>
 The bill passed by the Senate contained a very different provision, establishing a $5,000 maximum ``per inspection.''
<FOOTCITE>8</FOOTCITE>
 In conference, the Senate's clear mandate for a maximum dollar amount, no matter the number of violations, was rejected
in favor of the version passed by the House. This indicates that Congress did not intend to mandate a similar interpretation
for the field citation program.

Finally, EPA's interpretation is supported by the legislative history of title II's enforcement provisions. As
reported out of the Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works, sections 211(d)(1) and 205(c) of the Act authorized
administrative assessment of civil penalties of no more than ``$25,000 per day of violation.''
<FOOTCITE>9</FOOTCITE>
 In describing this authority, the Committee Report states that ``[t]his section of the bill changes the section 211(d)
penalty amount *&blank;*&blank;* to a maximum penalty of $25,000 per day of violation. This penalty amount applies
to 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

 This shows that when Congress used the term ``per day of violation'' in amending section 113 it had no intention of barring
an EPA interpretation that such term meant ``per day for each violation.''

On a separate issue, EPA considered several different ways to structure the field citation program so that as clear
a line as possible would be drawn indicating when it was appropriate to issue a field citation, and when one of the other
civil penalty authorities would be more appropriate. This is important, among other things, given the decentralized
nature of this program and the authority to issue citations in the field. One option considered was issuance of internal
Agency guidance on this point. As discussed in section D of this notice, EPA does intend to issue guidance on a wide variety
of matters related to this program, and an important component of this will include guidance on when to issue a citation
and when to employ other enforcement tools open to the Agency.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA also considered and is proposing establishing a maximum cumulative dollar amount that may be assessed in an individual
citation. This would have the advantage of providing an objective indication in the regulations themselves that
a more serious compliance problem exists and other, more stringent enforcement mechanisms would generally be more
appropriate. This maximum penalty amount could be reached by, for example, a combination of many violations (whether
occurring on the same or separate days), with low amounts per violation, or a smaller number of violations combined
with larger penalty amounts per violation. Either of these circumstances would serve to indicate that a stronger
enforcement approach may well be appropriate. While such a cap could be included in internal Agency guidance, a regulatory
cap will provide greater structure for this program, at least initially.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As a variation on the above, EPA considered establishing a maximum number of violations that could be included in an
individual citation. This option, however, might preclude issuance of a field citation where the number of violations
exceeded the maximum, even if the violations were all very minor and would receive a low penalty assessment. For this
reason EPA is not currently proposing this form of a cap.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA is proposing that the maximum cumulative penalty in an individual citation not exceed a dollar amount in the range
of $15,000 to $25,000. EPA invites comment on this range, and whether such a dollar cap should be in the regulations
or in Agency guidance. EPA is also considering and invites comment on whether the penalty cap should ``sunset'' after
a pre-set time period, ranging from one or two years to a longer period. Before the cap expired of its own terms, EPA would
reevaluate whether it should continue, and if appropriate, would revise the regulations to extend the cap or some
more useful version thereof.

C. Penalty Assessment Policy
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The regulations proposed today define minor violation, establish the maximum penalty amount per violation, and
address matters concerning hearings to contest assessment of a civil penalty through a field citation. EPA plans
to develop detailed guidance that will address many of the other issues concerning implementation of the field citation
program. The following section discusses important aspects of EPA's planned guidance on the penalty amounts to be
assessed by field citations.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Penalty assessment under the field citation program will be designed to achieve expeditious compliance with the
applicable Clean Air Act requirements. Although only minor violations of the Act will be subject to the program, the
penalties must be significant enough to deter violations and to ensure a high rate of compliance. On the other hand,
penalties will generally be significantly lower than amounts that could be assessed through other enforcement means.
EPA plans to incorporate these objectives into a field citation penalty assessment policy, which will become a component
of the Agency's Clean Air Act civil penalty assessment policy.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The penalty assessment guidance will explain how the Agency intends to evaluate the penalty assessment criteria
in section 113(e) of the Act when determining penalty amounts. The Agency is considering assigning standardized
penalty amounts to specific categories of violations. These standard amounts might then be modified by means of a
penalty matrix, which would take into account such factors as the seriousness of the violation; the degree of environmental
harm; or other appropriate criteria.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA expects that its penalty assessment guidance will limit the discretion of inspectors and others in setting penalty
amounts. For example, any matrix approach as described above would constrain the person issuing the field citation
to operate within the limits of the matrix. In addition, EPA expects the guidance will establish that where the amount
of a penalty would be based on specific characteristics of the violation and the person issuing the citation has not
obtained evidence relating to one of the characteristics, then that characteristic would be treated as neutral for
purposes of penalty assessment.

D. Program Implementation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In addition to guidance on the penalty amounts assessed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
through the field citation program, EPA plans to issue guidance 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
addressing a wide variety of other implementation issues. This 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
guidance would be carefully designed to spell out and restrict 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the day-to-day practice under this program. EPA believes this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
approach will facilitate achievement of the goals for this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
program, and still provide the flexibility necessary for an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
enforcement program designed to address a wide variety of factual 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
circumstances. This section describes EPA's current ideas on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
certain elements of this program guidance. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Field citations may be issued either in the field or from 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
an EPA office. Violations of reporting requirements, for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
example, will typically involve desk issuance since discovery of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
these violations normally occurs not in the field, but in an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
office designated to receive such reports. Even where a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
violation is discovered in the field, an inspector may elect to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
return to the office for further review or discussion with 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
management prior to issuing a field citation. In order to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
promote consistency, inspectors will be encouraged to return to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the office for clarification whenever there is any doubt 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
regarding the nature of a violation or the appropriate penalty 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
amount. During the initial phase of program implementation, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Agency anticipates that most field citations will be issued from 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
an EPA office, based on field inspections. After a suitable 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
period of experience with the program, it is expected that the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
majority of inspection-based citations will be issued on-site. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Agency will then establish guidelines for particular 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
situations in which office-only issuance would still be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
recommended, e.g., based on penalties exceeding a specified 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
dollar amount, or for other relevant considerations. Although 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
State and local employees may not issue federal field citations 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
pursuant to this regulation, EPA employees may rely on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
information gathered during State and local inspections as a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
basis for issuing field citations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Following discovery of a minor violation and issuance of a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
field citation, the respondent will have thirty days in which to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
either pay the assessed penalty or to request a hearing. EPA 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reserves the right to revoke a field citation, in whole or in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
part, at any time prior to payment of the assessed penalty. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA believes this authority is a necessary safeguard in this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
program. It will allow a reevaluation, before the process has 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
gone very far, of whether a citation should have been issued. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For example, this could involve a reevaluation of whether a filed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
citation is the most appropriate enforcement tool, or could 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
involve the early resolution of a citation issued in error. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As noted above, EPA will prepare detailed guidance for the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
implementation of the field citation program. The guidance will 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
cover such broad areas as coordination of inspections with State 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and local agencies, desk issuance as opposed to field issuance, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
determination of whether a violation is minor, and calculation of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
penalty amounts. The guidance will also cover such issues as how 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to revoke a field citation, and how field citations will be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
recorded and tracked. Finally, the guidance will include 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
procedures for determining appropriate penalty amounts, and an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
actual sample of the design and format of the field citation.

Authorities

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Under section 113(b) of the Act, the Agency is authorized to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
commence civil judicial enforcement actions against certain 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
violators to assess and recover civil penalties of up to $25,000 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
per day for each violation, and/or to seek temporary or permanent 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
injunctions. Civil actions under section 113(b) are most 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
advantageous when: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) A compliance schedule or other injunctive relief is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
necessary and an administrative compliance order under section 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
113(a) is either unavailable or inappropriate; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) The violator's compliance history indicates that the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
compliance schedule should be subject to court supervision and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
contempt remedies; or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Substantial civil penalties are appropriate. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In 1990, Congress amended section 113 of the Act, providing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
new authority for the Administrator to issue administrative 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
penalty orders under section 113(d)(1). These administrative 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
penalty orders, which may assess civil penalties of up to $25,000 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
per day of violation, may be issued where: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) The total penalty sought does not exceed $200,000; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(2) The first alleged date of violation occurred no more 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
than twelve months prior to initiation of the administrative 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
action. The Administrator and the Attorney General may, however, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
jointly determine that an administrative penalty action is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
appropriate for either a larger penalty or a longer period of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
violation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Administrative penalties under section 113(d)(1) are most advantageous where: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) The violator does not have a compliance history of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
multiple or repeat violations; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Court-supervised injunctive relief is not appropriate. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Additionally, civil judicial action is preferred over 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
administrative action where extensive post-filing discovery will 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
be necessary to fully develop the circumstances associated with 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
one or more violations, and where new legal issues are presented 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
by a case. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The field citation program under section 113(d)(3) is another new enforcement authority provided by the November
15, 1990 Amendments. As indicated elsewhere in this preamble, the field citation program involves the issuance of
citations that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
assess civil penalties, not exceeding $5,000 per day of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
violation, for minor violations of the Act. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The focus of the field citation program will be to ensure compliance with regulatory requirements that often remain
unaddressed due to limited Agency resources. The opportunity for streamlined, expedited enforcement to address
minor violations should save Agency resources, reduce court backlogs, and send a clear enforcement message to violators
that minor violations will not be overlooked.

Under the Act, field citations ``may be issued by officers or employees designated by the Administrator.'' It is the
Agency's position that section 113(d)(3) does not authorize delegation of section 113 field citation authority
to State and local officials. The legislative history supports this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
interpretation.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The success of the field citation program will depend on well-trained inspectors and enforcement officers, skilled
at both recognizing minor violations and determining appropriate penalty amounts. Before implementing this program,
EPA will offer a number of Regional inspector training sessions to ensure that inspectors and enforcement personnel
are completely familiar with the program and understand the limits of its applicability. In 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
particular, employees will be trained to identify minor violations based on the criteria set forth in this regulation.
They will also be trained to identify circumstances in which particular violations might indicate a more serious
compliance problem that should be handled through a more stringent 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
enforcement action. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition to training, inspectors and enforcement officers will be given a detailed guidance document containing
recommended penalty ranges associated with specific categories of violations. In this way, inspectors will have
a ready reference if they are unsure about a particular violation. Moreover, the establishment of appropriate penalty
amounts in guidance will help to ensure 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
national consistency. Whenever there are doubts regarding how to characterize a suspected violation, inspectors
will be directed to return to the office for further evaluation and consultation.

G. Rules Governing Hearings on Field Citations 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In addition to authorizing EPA to implement a field citation program, section 113(d)(3) of the Act addresses certain
basic procedural issues involving hearings on field citations. First, it provides that any person to whom a civil
penalty is assessed through a field citation may elect either to pay the civil penalty or to request a hearing on the
field citation. Any 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
request for a hearing must be within the time period prescribed by the Administrator through regulation, and if a hearing
is not requested within such time then the penalty assessment in the field citation becomes final. Second, this section
explicitly provides that the hearing on a field citation shall not be subject to the Administrative Procedure Act
(APA) provisions on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
formal adjudications (5 U.S.C. 554 or 556), but shall provide a reasonable opportunity to be heard and to present evidence.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA is proposing three distinct alternatives to implement these statutory provisions and establish fair and reasonable
procedures to govern hearings on field citations. These alternatives are: (1) EPA's consolidated, APA penalty assessment
procedures under 40 CFR part 22, with appropriate revisions; (2) EPA's proposed consolidated, non-APA penalty assessment
procedures under 40 CFR part 28, with appropriate revisions; and (3) new streamlined administrative procedures
contained in today's proposal. The following section discusses and evaluates each of these alternatives. The Agency
requests comment on the propriety of each of these penalty assessment procedures. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Procedures for the assessment of field citation penalties must reasonably implement the requirements of section
113(d)(3), including providing a reasonable opportunity to be heard and to present evidence, and must also satisfy
procedural due process considerations under the Constitution. Determining compliance with both of these requirements
requires a close comparison between the proposed procedures, the factual and legal situations 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that are expected to arise under this program, and the interests at issue, both private and governmental.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Congress specifically limited field citations to minor 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
violations, as defined by the Agency. While EPA's proposed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
definition of minor violation does not specify each and every 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
violation that might be considered minor, it does set clear 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
limits on the kinds of violations that will be considered minor 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
violations. The many different kinds of violations that may meet 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the definition of minor violation will exhibit common features. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For example, the typical minor violation will involve a clear and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
straightforward violation, both factually and legally, of limited 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
frequency or duration and limited environmental impact. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
factual and legal issues that EPA expects to arise in field 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
citation assessments are, overall, expected to be simple and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
uncomplicated. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The basic private interest at stake is the assessment of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
civil penalties of up to a maximum of $5,000 per day for each 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
violation, as well as the resources needed to contest such 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
assessments where considered appropriate. The maximum penalty is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
significantly lower than the maximum administrative or judicial 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
civil penalties authorized under sections 113, 205 and 211 of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Act. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The primary governmental interest is implementation of a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
program that fairly fills a gap in EPA's enforcement programs, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
without undue drain on EPA's limited enforcement resources. EPA 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
believes this interest is best served by addressing minor 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
violations in a straightforward and direct manner, somewhat akin 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to a traffic enforcement program. The deterrence effect from 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
this program will come in large part from the issuance of a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
citation immediately upon or shortly after detection of a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
violation, with final assessment of the penalty occurring shortly 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
after issuance of the citation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA has considered these and other factors in evaluating the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
three options proposed today for hearing procedures, and believes 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
all three fully implement Congressional intent and satisfy due 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
process requirements. The three options draw different balances 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
between complexity and simplicity, formality and informality, but 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
are all designed to implement a program aimed at simple and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
uncomplicated violations, involving penalties significantly lower 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
than others authorized in the Act, and requiring straightforward, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
quick and fair adjudication to obtain the desired deterrent 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
effect without undue drain on limited Agency resources.

Basis for Hearing Procedures 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Although the Act explicitly indicates that hearings in field 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
citation cases are not subject to the provisions for formal APA 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
adjudication, it does not prohibit the Agency from exercising its 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
discretion and providing such procedural rights. There are two 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
primary benefits in using part 22 to govern hearings on field 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
citations: (1) It would consolidate Clean Air Act administrative 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
penalty hearings under one set of procedural rules, minimizing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the need for the Agency and the regulated community to learn and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
become proficient in more than one set of procedures; and (2) it 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
would use a penalty assessment procedure with which both the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Agency and the regulated community have a great deal of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
experience. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Act as amended in 1990 authorizes the Administrator to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
issue administrative penalty orders under section 113(d)(1). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
These administrative penalty orders, which may assess civil 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
penalties of up to $25,000 per day of violation, are generally 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
limited to situations where the total penalty sought does not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
exceed $200,000 and where the first alleged date of violation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
occurred no more than twelve months prior to initiation of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
administrative action. Similar authority was provided under 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
sections 205(c) and 211(d)(1) of the Act. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The penalties contained in administrative penalty orders 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
issued under section 113(d)(1) are assessed pursuant to the part 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
22 procedures, as are administrative penalties assessed under 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
sections 205(c) and 211(d)(1). Part 22 was amended to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
incorporate these provisions on February 4, 1992 (57 FR 4318). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Thus, using part 22 to govern hearings on field citations issued 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
under section 113(d)(3) would consolidate all of the Clean Air 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Act administrative penalty hearings under one set of procedures. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Additionally, the Agency has used part 22 for assessing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
administrative penalties under other environmental statutes since 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1980. Consequently, both the regulated community and the Agency 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
have considerable experience with these procedures, thereby 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
simplifying the implementation of the field citation program. As 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
discussed later, minor revisions to part 22 procedures would be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
adopted to account for certain statutory provisions in section 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
113(d)(3) and to account for the types of violations and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
penalties associated with field citations.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Under part 22, the field citation would be issued by an EPA 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
officer or employee as an administrative complaint. Within 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
twenty days after service of the citation, the Respondent must 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
file an answer. In the answer, the Respondent may contest the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
facts in the complaint, the size of the penalty, or claim that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the Respondent is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. If 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requested by the Respondent, a hearing will be held on the issues 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
raised in the citation and answer. The Presiding Officer has the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
discretion to allow the Respondent to amend his answer. A 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
default order, which allows the full proposed penalty to be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
collected, may be issued upon motion if the Respondent fails to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
file an answer. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Respondent may simultaneously pursue informal settlement 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and a hearing. During settlement negotiations, the parties may 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
informally exchange information, if appropriate. For example, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the Agency may supply copies of the documentation used to support 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
its case and the Respondent might provide any evidence that would 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
tend to disprove the allegations or to mitigate the penalty. A 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
written Consent Agreement and a proposed Consent Order are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
submitted for approval by the Regional Administrator, if the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
parties reach a settlement of the claim. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Either party may file a preliminary motion for an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
accelerated decision if no genuine issues of material fact exist. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Respondent may file a motion for dismissal of the citation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A mandatory prehearing conference is held to simplify 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
issues; to limit the number of potential witnesses; and to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
address other matters that may expedite the hearing. An exchange 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of witness lists and documents occurs at the prehearing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
conference. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The hearing is held for the presentation of evidence and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
testimony concerning the facts relating to the violation and to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the size of the penalty. Except as otherwise provided by the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Presiding Officer, witnesses are to be examined orally, under 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
oath or affirmation, at the hearing. The parties have the right 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to cross-examine witnesses who testify at the hearing. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Presiding Officer may take notice of any matter judicially 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
noticed in the Federal courts and of any facts falling within the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
specialized knowledge and expertise of the Agency. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
At the hearing, the Agency has the burden of going forward 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and proving that the violation occurred and that the proposed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
penalty is appropriate. After a prima facie case is established, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the Respondent has the burden of presenting and going forward 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
with any defense to the allegations in the citation. The matters 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in controversy are determined by the Presiding Officer upon a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
preponderance of evidence. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The hearing must be transcribed. Within twenty days after 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the transcript is available, the parties may submit proposed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
findings of fact and conclusions of law with supporting briefs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Reply briefs are also authorized. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Presiding Officer issues the initial decision, which 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
consists of findings of fact, conclusions of law, and recommended 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
civil penalty. In reaching an initial decision, the Presiding 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Officer is required to consider the statutory penalty assessment 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
criteria listed in section 113(e), section 205(c) or section 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
211(d) of the Act, as appropriate. For section 113(e), these 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
criteria include: The size of the business; the economic impact 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of the penalty on the business; the Respondent's full compliance 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
history; the Respondent's good faith efforts to comply; the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
duration of the violation as established by any credible 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
evidence; payment by the Respondent of penalties previously 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
assessed for the same violation; the economic benefit of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
noncompliance; the seriousness of the violation; and such other 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
factors as justice may require. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If the Presiding Officer recommends a penalty different from 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the one proposed by the citation, the initial decision must set 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
forth the specific reasons for the increase or decrease. Either 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
party may file a motion to reopen the hearing within twenty (20) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
days of service of the initial decision. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Unless a party appeals to the Environmental Appeals Board 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(the Board) within twenty (20) days of service, or unless the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Board elects to review it 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
sua sponte
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, the Presiding Officer's 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
initial decision becomes a final order of the Board within forty-five (45) days after service. A final order of the
Board shall 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
adopt, modify or set aside the findings and conclusions of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
initial decision. The Board is authorized to increase or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
decrease the assessed penalty, except in the case of a default 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
order. A motion for reconsideration of the final order may be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
filed with the Board within ten (10) days after service of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
final order.

Procedural Due Process 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
EPA analyzed the issue of procedural due process with its 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
consolidated APA rules of practice when they were promulgated. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
See 52 FR 2922 (August 6, 1987) (NPRM) and 57 FR 4316 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(February 4, 1992) (FRM). In that analysis EPA evaluated and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
balanced the three factors specified by the Supreme Court in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

Eldridge
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, 424 U.S. 319 (1976) for determining whether 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the administrative procedure provided to an individual prior to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the deprivation of a property interest meets the due process 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requirements of the Fifth Amendment: the magnitude and nature of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the individual interest at stake, the risk of an erroneous 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
deprivation of that interest and the benefit of additional 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
procedures in reducing that risk, and the governmental interest 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in not providing such additional procedures. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA's APA style hearing procedures would certainly satisfy 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
procedural due process considerations as well as statutory 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requirements if employed for hearings on field citations. By 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
statute APA adjudication procedures are not required. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
violations are by definition minor in nature and should involve 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
simple and straightforward factual and legal situations. In 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
fact, EPA believes these procedures provide significantly more 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
process than required by the Fifth Amendment for hearings on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
field citations, and are proposed as an option not because of due 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
process considerations but because of the expected benefits of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
having a single set of procedures governing all administrative 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
penalty proceedings under the Clean Air Act. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA is also considering certain revisions to the Part 22 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
procedures to account for the minor nature of the violations at 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
issue under the field citation program. First, EPA is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
considering using presiding officers that are not administrative 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
law judges. As with other non-APA situations, the agency's 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
presiding officers would conduct the hearings and take other 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
actions. This would help to conserve the agency's administrative 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
law judge resources for APA hearings, with no expected reduction 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in the accuracy of the hearing process. The Agency is also 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
considering such revisions as making the prehearing conference 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
optional and changing the deadline for default from twenty to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
thirty days following service.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In addition, EPA is considering limiting appeals from the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
presiding officer to the EAB. Appeals from the initial decision 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
on a field citation would not be of right, but would be at the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
discretion of the EAB. For example, a party seeking an appeal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
from the initial decision would file a motion with the EAB 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
seeking leave to appeal. There would only be an appeal to the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EAB if they granted such motion, or reviewed the initial decision 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
sua sponte
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. Absent such review by the EAB, the initial decision 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of the presiding officer would become the final order of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Agency. EPA expects that in the typical situation the EAB would 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
not hear an appeal from either party given the expected nature of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the minor violations. Appeals typically would be limited to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
cases with unique factual or legal circumstances. This would 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
conserve the Agency's resources for hearing and deciding 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
administrative appeals, and allow their use for APA cases and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
more complex cases. At the same time, where appropriate the EAB 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
could hear an appeal. This would minimize the chance of an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
erroneous deprivation of an individual interest, and at the same 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
time maximize the efficient use of scarce Agency resources.

2. Modified 40 CFR Part 28_Consolidated Rules of Practice Governing the Administrative Assessment of Civil Penalties

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under Various Statutes 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Under the second option considered and proposed by the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Agency, the hearings on field citations would be conducted 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
pursuant to the procedures in EPA
<!-- PJG 0034 unknown -->
s proposed non-APA, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
consolidated rules of practice for the administrative assessment 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of penalties, with appropriate revisions to conform with the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Clean Air Act. (See proposed 40 CFR part 28, 56 FR 29996 (July 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1, 1991)). In a separate rulemaking, the Agency would propose to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
amend Part 28, where appropriate, to make that regulation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
applicable to field citations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
Basis for Hearing Procedures 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The rules of procedure proposed as 40 CFR Part 28 are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
intended to consolidate under uniform rules of practice the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
following non-APA administrative penalty programs that are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
currently administered by the Agency: Class I administrative 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
penalties under sections 309(g) and 311(b)(6) of the Clean 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Water Act, section 109(a) of the Comprehensive Environmental 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Response, Compensation, and Liability Act of 1980 (CERCLA), and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
section 325(b) of the Emergency Planning and Community Right-toKnow Act (EPCRA); and administrative penalties
under section 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1423(c) of the Safe Drinking Water Act and sections 325 (c) and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(d) of EPCRA. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Part 28 was proposed to consolidate and harmonize certain 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA procedural rules and guidance for the administrative 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
assessment of civil penalties under various statutes, where 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Congress gave EPA authority to conduct non-APA hearings. In line 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
with this Congressional intent, proposed part 28 is designed to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
provide streamlined administrative penalty procedures that are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
designed to assure the protection of basic constitutional rights. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 113(d)(3) of the Act explicitly states that hearings on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
field citations are not subject to the APA provisions for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
hearings (5 U.S.C. 554), and that recipients of a field 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
citation must be provided a reasonable opportunity to be heard 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and to present evidence.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The basic hearing requirements of the field citation program 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
are therefore similar in structure to those programs proposed for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
inclusion under 40 CFR part 28.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Inclusion of hearings on CAA field citations in part 28 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
would be consistent with the goals stated by EPA when it proposed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
these consolidated rules for non-APA hearing procedures under 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
various statutes_reduction of confusion by Agency decision 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
makers and enforcement staffs, provision for the regulated 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
community of an essentially uniform set of procedural rules, and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
conformity with Congress' and EPA's desire to employ expedited 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
penalty assessment procedures. At the same time, the proposed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
part 28 procedures are designed to provide non-APA hearing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
procedures under a wide range of statutory provisions, involving 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
civil penalties ranging from $5,000 for each day of violation to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
$25,000 per violation. This contrasts with the field citation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
program, involving no more than $5,000 per day of violation for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
minor violations of the Act or its implementing regulations. In 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
addition, adoption of part 28 procedures for the field citation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
program would also involve two separate procedures for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
administrative assessment of civil penalties under the CAA, parts 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
28 and 22. Adding the field citation program to part 28, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
however, would promote a greater potential for non-APA multimedia 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
enforcement actions by providing a common administrative forum. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As with the part 22 option, the currently proposed part 28 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
procedures would be modified in certain ways to account for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
certain aspects of the field citation program. These are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
discussed later. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

Proposed Hearing Procedures 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Under the modified part 28, the field citation would be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
issued as an administrative complaint. Unlike proposed part 28, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
however, the field citation complaints would not require 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
certification by an Agency attorney. Within thirty days after 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
service of the citation, the Respondent must file a response 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requesting a hearing. A 90-day extension of time to respond may 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
be granted by the complainant. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As in part 22 practice, the Respondent may simultaneously 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
pursue informal settlement and a hearing. During settlement 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
negotiations, the parties may informally exchange information, if 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
appropriate. For example, the Agency may supply copies of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
documentation used to support its case and the Respondent might

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
EPA's experience has been that the great majority of its 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
administrative penalty actions conclude by a settlement. Part 28 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
explicitly provides settlement procedures and, unlike part 22, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
would allow field citation cases to settle by the simple 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
agreement of the parties in a consent order or, if the Respondent 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
chooses, by the Respondent's payment of the amount requested by 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the Agency in the field citation itself (or in any superseding 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
pleading). Under part 28, a settlement may be reached at any 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
time, even before the deadline for a response has passed. In 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
cases of settlement, there is no further administrative review, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and the Respondent waives its rights to appeal the administrative 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
penalty to the appropriate federal court. Pursuant to the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
language of the CAA, consent orders under the Part 28 field 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
citation program would allow for the compromise, modification, or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
remission by the Agency, with or without conditions, of any 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
penalty requested in the administrative complaint. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Part 28 would be revised such that failure of the Respondent 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to affirmatively request a hearing in the response would lead to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
assessment of the penalty proposed in the field citation. Under 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
section 113(d)(3) of the Act, the penalty assessed by the field 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
citation becomes final if the Respondent fails to request a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
hearing within the time required by the implementing regulation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Part 28 would also be revised to require Agency counsel to file a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
written explanation for the penalty imposed by the field citation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
no later than five days following a Respondent's default by 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
failure to request a hearing. This would ensure an adequate 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
administrative record for the penalty imposed. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Upon the request of a party, or on his own initiative, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Presiding Officer may make a summary adjudication of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
allegations, without further proceedings, whenever he finds that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
there are no material facts in dispute and that a party is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
entitled to judgment as a matter of law. In the same manner, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Presiding Officer may accelerate the transmittal of his 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
recommended decision to the Regional Administrator if there is no 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
compelling need for additional fact-finding on remedy issues. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Either party may request a summary determination or an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
accelerated recommended decision at any time after service of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
response, up until thirty days before the time set for a hearing. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Alternatively, the Presiding Officer may summarily determine any 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of the allegations after the time for the exchange of information 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
has run, and after he has examined the entire administrative 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
record. The Presiding Officer may accelerate the transmittal of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the recommended decision, upon finding liability in a summary 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
determination or upon stipulation as to liability by the parties, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
if there is no need for further fact-finding as to remedy. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In reaching a recommended decision, the Presiding Officer is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
required to consider the statutory penalty assessment criteria 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
listed in section 113(e) of the Act. These criteria include the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
size of the business; the economic impact of the penalty on the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
business; the Respondent's full compliance history; the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Respondent's good faith efforts to comply; the duration of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
violation as established by any credible evidence; payment by the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Respondent of penalties previously assessed for the same 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
violation; the economic benefit of noncompliance; the seriousness 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of the violation; and such other factors as justice may require. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Respondent is afforded the opportunity to provide evidence of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the relevant statutory criteria, including evidence concerning 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the duration of the violation. Part 28 would be revised to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
incorporate these statutory penalty assessment criteria. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Other than by a motion for summary determination or by a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
motion for an accelerated recommended decision, a field citation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
may be settled preliminarily by a consent order. The consent 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
order includes a penalty settlement which has the force and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
effect of a final order issued by the Regional Administrator, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
except that the consent order is not appealable. Part 28 would 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
be revised to provide that, consistent with the authority under 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
section 113(d)(2)(B), the consent order may be issued with or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
without conditions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Part 28 establishes deadlines to ensure that administrative 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
cases do not languish. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Not later than thirty days following the Respondent's 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
response, the Presiding Officer is required to hold a prehearing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
conference at which the parties meet to consider matters which 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
may expedite the disposition of the proceedings. The Presiding 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Officer also sets the time and place for further proceedings and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
schedules an information exchange during the prehearing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
conference, if one is requested. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The authority to require discovery is limited to exchange of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
certain information. The required information that may be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
exchanged is limited to: (1) Documents intended to be introduced 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
at the proceedings under Part 28 that have not already been filed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
with the Hearing Clerk; (2) witness lists, qualifications of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
expert witnesses and the subject matter of intended witness 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
testimony; and (3) information known to the Respondent relating 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to the Respondent's inability to pay a civil penalty or relating 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to any economic advantage accruing to the Respondent as a result 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of his alleged violations of law. Part 28 would be revised to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
expand this last category, by allowing the Agency to include the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Respondent's good faith efforts to comply with the applicable 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Clean Air Act requirements. Other forms of discovery, including 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
interrogatories and the taking of depositions, are not permitted 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
unless stipulated to by the parties. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Except for supplemental materials, the information exchange 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
must conclude no later than sixty days following the prehearing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
conference. Since new information concerning witnesses or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
documents may develop after an information response deadline 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
passes, the parties may supplement the original information, but 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
not later than seven days prior to the hearing. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In order to provide the parties with incentives to cooperate 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
during the discovery phase, there are both mandatory and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
discretionary sanctions for failure to comply with the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
information exchange requirements. For example, if a party fails 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to timely provide the name and all supporting information 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
regarding any witness it intends to present at a hearing, such 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
witness may not be presented. Similarly, if a party fails to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
timely produce a document it intends to introduce at such a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
hearing, that document may not be introduced to prove the truth 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of what it asserts. Part 28 would be revised to provide that if 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the Respondent fails to timely provide information regarding its 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
good faith efforts to comply with the Act, then that information 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
may not be used by the Respondent at the hearing. The Presiding 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Officer may also impose additional appropriate sanctions on a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
party that fails to fully comply with these requirements. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In conducting the hearing, the Presiding Officer may limit 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the number of witnesses and the scope and extent of both the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
direct examination and cross-examination. Cross-examination is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
limited to the scope of the direct examination. The Presiding 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Officer may take testimony in the form that is the most efficient 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
under the circumstances. No matter what form of testimony is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
permitted, however, the Presiding Officer will make adequate 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
provision to ensure that each party retains its right of cross-examination if the witness is available to testify
or is subject 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to a subpoena. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The hearing is generally limited to resolving disputed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
allegations as to liability. Remedy issues are generally 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
addressed in the parties' closing arguments, unless there is a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
compelling need for remedy testimony. Such need could arise 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
where the underlying facts which are material to the statutory 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
penalty assessment factors are disputed. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As is typical in administrative proceedings, strict 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
adherence to the Federal Rules of Evidence is not required under 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
part 28. Testimony or documentation that is ``relevant, material 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
or of significant probative value'', including hearsay, is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
admissible, as long as the witness presenting the information is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
subject to cross-examination by any opposing party. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Presiding Officer has the discretion to take official notice of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
certain facts, exclusive either of facts relating to settlement 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
or relating to a person's challenge to a final State or Agency 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
action. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed part 28 rules contemplate that each party will 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
have an opportunity to make an opening statement (with the Agency 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
making its opening statement first); that the Agency will put on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
its prima facie case; and that the Respondent thereafter will 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
have an opportunity to present its defense. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Participants may present oral closing arguments at the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
discretion of the Presiding Officer, and such arguments may 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
address both liability and remedy issues. The participants may 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
submit supporting documentation regarding remedy. If the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Presiding Officer does not allow oral closing arguments, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Agency anticipates that he would solicit the submission of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
written proposed recommended findings of fact and conclusions of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
law as to liability and remedy. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under part 28, the Presiding Officer would be required 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to: (1) Certify the administrative record as complete and as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
being in compliance with the requirements of part 28; (2) make 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the administrative record available to the Regional 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Administrator; and (3) prepare and transmit a recommended 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
decision to the Regional Administrator. The Presiding Officer's 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
authority to prescribe a remedy would be limited to recommending 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the withdrawal of the field citation or recommending the issuance 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of an order. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The decision of the Regional Administrator must be based on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
applicable law and on the administrative record, which includes 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the recommended decision of the Presiding Officer. Upon receipt 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of the Presiding Officer's recommended decision, the Regional 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Administrator may either withdraw the field citation, if he 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
concludes that the Agency has not sustained its burden of proof, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
or issue an order granting the requested relief, in whole or in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
part. Any decision by the Regional Administrator must be in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
writing, supported by clear reasons based on the administrative 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
record and applicable law, and include a statement of the right 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to judicial review and of the procedures and deadlines for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
obtaining judicial review. If the Regional Administrator rejects 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the recommendation of the Presiding Officer, the explanation for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that rejection must be in writing and made part of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
administrative record. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Regional Administrator's order must include a discussion 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of the applicable penalty factors which were considered in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
assessment of a penalty under the Act, and set forth the penalty 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
assessed. Part 28 would be revised to limit the Regional 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Administrator's authority to issue a default order by excluding 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
those based on a default for failure to respond or to request a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
hearing (which would become final, pursuant to section 113(d)(3) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of the CAA, by operation of law). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Any order issued by the Regional Administrator becomes 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
effective thirty days after issuance, unless either the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Environmental Appeals Board (the Board) suspends the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
implementation of the order pursuant to its 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
sua sponte
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 review 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
authority, or a judicial appeal is taken pursuant to section 113(d)(4) of the Act. No person may stay the effective
date of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
an administrative order by attempting to appeal it 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
administratively. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The decision of the Regional Administrator to issue a final 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
decision constitutes final Agency action (subject to 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
sua sponte
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
review by the Board) on its effective date, for purposes of any 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
judicial appeal. Withdrawal of the field citation, however, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
would not constitute final Agency action, unless it occurs 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
without prejudice. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Board, on behalf of the Administrator, is authorized to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
review part 28 rulings by Regional Administrators, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
sua sponte,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
issues of law. The Board may not become involved in factfinding; second guess the penalty amount issued by the Regional
Administrator; or review orders issued on consent. The Agency anticipates that this review authority will be exercised
infrequently, but believes that the authority is necessary to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ensure consistent Agency positions on the applicable law. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Board may withdraw a Regional Administrator's order if 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
it determines that the Agency lacks jurisdiction to assess a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
penalty, or if it determines that the Respondent is not liable 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
under applicable law. The Board shall remand an administrative 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
order if it determines that elements of the Respondent's 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
liability are different from those found by the Regional 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Administrator. Under such a remand, the remedy should be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
conformed to the amended conclusions of law. The order shall 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
also be remanded if the Board finds that the order fails to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
provide clear reasons for the decision. The Board shall allow 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the Regional Administrator's order to issue unchanged if it finds 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that the order is legally sufficient and it agrees with all 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
material conclusions of law. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Parties are not permitted under part 28 to administratively 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
appeal adverse rulings, either to the Regional Administrator or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to the Environmental Appeals Board.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
EPA recognizes that the administrative imposition of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
penalties for minor violations of the Act may affect 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
constitutionally protected interests of those against whom 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
actions have been taken. Part 28 includes precautions to ensure 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that individuals subject to a finding of liability for a civil 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
penalty will have all of the protections that due process of law 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requires. These precautions include an impartial Presiding 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Officer; the right to a hearing on liability, with a right of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
cross-examination; and a final Agency action based solely on the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
administrative record and applicable law. For a detailed due 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
process discussion concerning part 28, see the July 1, 1991 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proposal at 56 FR 29997 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et seq
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The part 28 procedures provide all of the procedure 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
necessary to meet constitutional due process requirements under 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the leading Supreme Court case, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Mathews
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 v. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Eldridge
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, 424 U.S. 319 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1976). In that case, the Supreme Court set out a three-part 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
test for determining whether the administrative procedure 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
provided to an individual prior to the deprivation of a property 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
interest by the government meets the due process requirements of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the Fifth Amendment. The 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Mathews 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
test involves balancing the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
magnitude and nature of the individual interest at stake; the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
benefit of additional procedures in reducing the risk of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
erroneous deprivation of that interest; and the governmental 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
interest in not providing such additional procedures. Although 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the part 28 procedures streamline the adjudicatory process 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
provided for analogous administrative hearings under the APA, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
those procedures do not eliminate any of the constitutional 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
elements of such hearings. The part 28 procedures grant the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
person receiving the field citation a full opportunity to review 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the evidence of minor violations, as well as address the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
propriety of the assessed penalty. Since these procedures allow 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for complete adjudication of liability issues, there would be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
little benefit to the Respondent in more extensive or attenuated 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
procedures, and disproportionate cost to the Agency and to the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
public. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The field citation program will typically address violation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and penalty issues that are simple and straightforward matters. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Since these cases should not be complex, their resolution is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
well-suited to the expedited administrative penalty proceedings 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
mandated by Congress and included in part 28. For these reasons 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
as well as those noted in the July 1, 1991 proposal, EPA believes 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the proposed part 28 procedures would adequately provide for due 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
process in the assessment of penalties under the field citation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
authority.

The third Agency proposal involves using new procedures for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
conducting administrative hearings requested by persons to whom 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
field citations have been issued under section 113(d) of the Act.

Background 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 113(d) of the Act provides that any person to whom a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
field citation is issued may either elect to pay the penalty 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
assessment or to request a hearing, in accordance with procedures 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
specified in the regulation which implements the field citation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
program. Section 113(d) further provides that the penalty 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
assessed in the field citation becomes final unless the person to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
whom it is issued requests a hearing within the time specified in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the implementing regulation. Section 113(d)(3) explicitly 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
provides that the hearing is not subject to the requirements of a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
formal adjudicatory hearing under the Administrative Procedure 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Act (APA), 5 U.S.C. 554 or 556. Instead, the hearing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
must provide a reasonable opportunity to be heard and to present 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
evidence.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Congressional intent to afford the Respondent a less 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
formal, non-APA hearing is explicit in the legislation. Although 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
such hearing must provide the Respondent with a reasonable 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
opportunity to be heard and to present evidence, such hearing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
shall not be subject to the procedures under sections 554 or 556 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of the APA. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On July 1, 1991, the Agency proposed non-APA consolidated 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
rules of practice for the administrative assessment of civil 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
penalties at 40 CFR part 28 (56 FR 29,996). Although the part 28 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
rules are intended to consolidate all other non-APA 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
administrative penalty programs currently administered by the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Agency under uniform rules of practice, the field citation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
program was excluded from those proposed rules. Programs covered 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
by part 28 include Class I administrative penalties under section 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
309(g) of the Clean Water Act, section 109(a) of CERCLA, and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
section 325(b) of EPCRA; and administrative penalties under 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
section 1423(c) of the Safe Drinking Water Act and sections 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
325(c) and (d) of EPCRA. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
There are several compelling reasons for developing hearing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
procedures that are better suited to the field citation program 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
than those provided either by proposed part 28 or the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
consolidated APA rules of practice promulgated at 40 CFR part 22, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
45 FR 24363 (April 9, 1980). The part 28 rules provide many of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the same procedural rights in part 22 that are designed to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
comport with APA requirements. These rights include prehearing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
conferences; subpoena authority; discovery rights; and cross-examination. The major differences between the
two rules are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that part 28 provides for a Presiding Officer instead of an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Administrative Law Judge; imposes page limits on written 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
submissions; and eliminates the right to appeal the decision of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the Presiding Officer or Regional Administrator to the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Administrator. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under the part 28 procedures, resolution of an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
administrative penalty proceeding could take seven or eight 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
months. This lengthy time period would diminish the utility of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the field citation program in addressing minor violations quickly 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and efficiently. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Most of the penalty programs covered by the part 28 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
procedures provide for maximum per day per violation penalties 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
well in excess of the $5,000 limit authorized for field 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
citations. Using the part 28 hearing procedures could result in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
spending more money to adjudicate field citation appeals than 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
would be justified by the expected monetary recovery. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Based on the foregoing reasons, the Agency is considering 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
using a more streamlined set of hearing procedures drafted 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
specifically to apply to the field citation program. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Today's proposal relies on some of the part 28 provisions 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
which ensure expedited proceedings. This proposed option also 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
relies on the rules at 33 CFR subpart 1.07, 43 FR 54186 (November 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
20, 1978), which govern hearings on statutory penalties imposed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
by the Coast Guard. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under section 311(b)(6) of the Clean Water Act, the Coast 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Guard is authorized to assess a civil penalty of up to $5,000 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
against any owner, operator or person in charge of a facility or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
vessel that discharges either oil or a hazardous substance. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
violator may challenge the penalty assessment at a hearing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
governed by the subpart 1.07 procedures. The similarities 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
between this program and the field citation program make the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
subpart 1.07 regulations an appropriate model for hearing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
procedures. These Coast Guard procedures were found to satisfy 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
due process under the Constitution in 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, 480 F. Supp. 474 (1979). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The part 28 regulations were used as a model for the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
following major provisions of the proposed part 59 hearing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
procedures: the Presiding Officer's duties and responsibilities; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
consent orders; prehearing conference; information exchange; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
post-hearing submissions; and review of the Regional 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Administrator's decision by the Environmental Appeals Board. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The subpart 1.07 regulations were used as a model for the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
following provisions: certain preliminary matters; confidential 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
business information; hearing procedures; and the scope of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Regional Administrator's authority for issuing a decision. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The relevant part 28 provisions were selected to ensure 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
fundamental fairness while streamlining the procedures available 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to Respondents. The Presiding Officer under part 28 is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
authorized to exercise a great deal of discretion to expedite the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
presentation of evidence in administrative cases. In that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
regard, the most pertinent authority adopted from the part 28 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
regulations allows the Presiding Officer to limit the number of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
witnesses and the extent of direct examination and cross-examination. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The provisions adopted from subpart 1.07 further streamline 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the administrative process for penalty assessment, while 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
guaranteeing fundamental rights. The Respondent is allowed under 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
subpart 1.07 to submit written arguments and evidence in lieu of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requesting a hearing. Such response allows the Presiding Officer 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to make a determination on the administrative record without the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
delays inherent in conducting the prehearing conference, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
information exchange, and hearing. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Additionally, the subpart 1.07 provisions allow the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Presiding Officer to determine the appropriate form of testimony: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
oral; written; or recorded. Subpart 1.07 also simplifies the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
hearing process by allowing the Respondent to present facts, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
statements, documents and other relevant evidence. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
relatively informal nature of the proceeding provides the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
opportunity for expedited penalty assessment.

Proposed Hearing Procedures

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Under proposed part 59, the field citation would be issued 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
during or shortly after an inspection by an EPA officer or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
employee. The citation is subsequently served upon the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Respondent by first class mail or equivalent. Within thirty days 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
after service of the citation, the Respondent must either request 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a hearing; provide written evidence and arguments in lieu of a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
hearing; or pay the penalty. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
If the Respondent fails either to request a hearing or to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
submit evidence in lieu of a hearing, he would be in default 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
under section 113(d)(3) of the Act. That section states that the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
penalty assessed by the field citation becomes final where the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Respondent fails to request a hearing within the time required by 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the implementing regulation. In the case of a Respondent's 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
default by failure to request a hearing, Agency counsel is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
required under this proposal to file, within ten days, a written 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
justification for the penalty imposed by the field citation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
At any time prior to final Agency action, a disputed field 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
citation may be settled by a consent order. The consent order 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
may conclude the citation in whole or in part, and may contain 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
conditions. Upon service, the consent order constitutes a final 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
order that is not appealable. Additionally, the field citation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
may be revoked by the Agency, in whole or in part and without 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
prejudice, prior to payment of the penalty. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under the proposed part 59 procedures, the prehearing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
conference is optional. The purposes of the conference, which 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
must be held no later than thirty days after the Respondent's 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
response, are to simplify issues and to attempt to reach 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
stipulations of fact. The Presiding Officer may also set the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
time and place for the hearing and schedule an information 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
exchange during the prehearing conference. Within twenty days 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
following the prehearing conference, the Presiding Officer may 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
issue a written prehearing order to memorialize the rulings made 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
at the conference. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Each party has the authority to require that the other 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
provide it with certain information. The information that may be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
exchanged is limited to: (1) Documents intended to be introduced 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
at the hearing that have not already been filed with the Hearing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Clerk; (2) witness lists, qualifications of expert witnesses and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the subject matter of intended witness testimony; and (3) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
information known to the Respondent relating to the Respondent's 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
inability to pay a civil penalty, economic benefit of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
noncompliance; and good faith efforts to comply with the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
applicable Clean Air Act requirements. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The hearings on field citations will be conducted by an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
impartial Presiding Officer who, in most cases, will be the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Judicial Officer or the Regional Judicial Officer. Such Judicial 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Officer will be an Agency employee who may perform other 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
functions within the Agency, but who has no prior connection with 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the case being presided over. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Presiding Officer and other officials involved in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
deciding the case are prohibited under today's rule from engaging 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in ex parte contacts with interested parties both inside and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
outside of the Agency. The prohibition applies to the Regional 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Administrator as well as to his advisors. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Presiding Officer is required to schedule a hearing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
expeditiously. An extension of time for scheduling the hearing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
is only authorized for good cause and if no prejudice results. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The hearing procedures provide that the Respondent may be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
represented by counsel. The Agency representative initiates the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
hearing by introducing into evidence the field citation and the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
relevant material supporting its issuance. The Respondent or his 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
counsel may then provide facts, statements, arguments, documents, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
testimony and other exculpatory evidence responding to the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
evidence presented. Although the Presiding Officer may limit the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
number of witnesses and determine the appropriate form of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
testimony, either party has the right to cross-examine a witness 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
who has provided direct testimony. The opportunity for rebuttal, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and response to rebuttal, falls within the Presiding Officer's 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
discretion. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Consistent with the informal nature of the proceedings, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Presiding Officer is not bound by the Federal Rules of Evidence. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Presiding Officer is, however, authorized to take 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
administrative notice of pertinent matters. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 113(e) of the Act contains criteria that must be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
used in assessing whether the field citation penalty is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
appropriate. Under today's proposal, the Presiding Officer is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
required to consider these criteria when reviewing the assessed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
penalty. Those criteria include: The size of the business; the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
economic impact of the penalty on the business; the Respondent's 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
full compliance history; the Respondent's good faith efforts to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
comply; the duration of the violation as established by any 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
credible evidence; payment by the Respondent of penalties 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
previously assessed for the same violation; the economic benefit 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of noncompliance; the seriousness of the violation; and such 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
other factors as justice may require. Some or all of these 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
criteria may be relevant to the issues presented in the case 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
before the Presiding Officer. The burden of proof with respect 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to these criteria is assigned to the party with access to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
information concerning the particular factor. Consequently, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Agency must provide evidence regarding the duration and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
seriousness of the violation, and the Respondent must provide 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
evidence regarding the other criteria. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA is considering adopting a similar approach where the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
penalty assessment becomes final under section 113(d)(3) of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Act because a respondent fails either to request a hearing or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
submit evidence in lieu of a hearing within the time required by 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the regulations. When such a default occurs, the penalty 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
assessed by the field citation becomes final by operation of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
section 113(d)(3). As previously discussed, under the proposed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
procedures, Agency counsel would then submit a written 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
justification for the record concerning the amount of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
assessed penalty. EPA is considering adopting a regulatory 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
presumption that in cases of such default the penalty assessed in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the field citation would be presumed to be appropriate with 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
respect to those penalty assessment criteria where the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
regulations would place the burden of going forward on the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
respondent if a hearing had been requested. The purpose of this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
presumption would be to clarify the requirements of section 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
113(e) in such a default situation, and at the same time, reflect 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the authority of the agency to establish reasonable presumptions 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
based on the circumstances of a case. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The hearing will normally be tape recorded, unless the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
parties decide otherwise in the interests of preventing a serious 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
delay in the proceedings. Tape recording the proceedings is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
desirable to develop a clear administrative record for later 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
review. Transcription of the proceedings is not required, but 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
may be made by a party, at its own expense, or may be ordered by 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the Presiding Officer. Any party causing a transcript to be made 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
must provide copies to the other party and to the Presiding 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Officer. The transcript then becomes a part of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
administrative record. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The parties are permitted to submit a written statement for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the Presiding Officer's consideration within a reasonable time 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
after the hearing. The written statements, which may only 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
address matters raised at the hearing, may be in the form of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proposed findings of fact and conclusions of law. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As soon as practicable after the hearing, the Presiding 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Officer is required to prepare a recommended decision in the case 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
based on substantial evidence in the administrative record as a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
whole. The recommended decision will recommend either that the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
field citation be affirmed, modified or withdrawn. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
recommended decision must be filed with the Regional 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Administrator. Within a reasonable time after receipt of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
recommended decision, the Regional Administrator may either 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
affirm, reverse, modify or remand the case to the Presiding 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Officer for further proceedings. The Regional Administrator may 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
compromise, modify, or remit the penalty assessed by the field 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
citation, with or without conditions.

issues of law. The Board may not review fact-finding; second 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
guess the penalty amount issued by the Regional Administrator; or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
overturn orders issued on consent. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Board may withdraw a Regional Administrator's order if 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
it determines that the Agency lacks jurisdiction to assess a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
penalty, or if it determines that the Respondent is not liable 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
under applicable law. The Board shall remand an administrative 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
order if it determines that elements of the Respondent's 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
liability are different from those found by the Regional 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Administrator. Under such a remand, the remedy should be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
conformed to the amended conclusions of law. The order shall 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
also be remanded if the Board finds that the order fails to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
provide clear reasons for the decision. The Board shall allow 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the Regional Administrator's order to issue unchanged if it finds 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that the order is legally sufficient and it agrees with all 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
material conclusions of law. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Within thirty days after the penalty assessment becomes 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
final, the Respondent may appeal to the appropriate United States 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 requires 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
consideration of three factors in evaluating whether the proposed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
administrative procedures satisfy the Fifth Amendment's due 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
process requirements. The relevant factors are: (1) The private 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
interest that will be affected; (2) the risk of an erroneous 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
deprivation of this interest and the probable value, if any, of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
additional or substitute procedural safeguards; and (3) the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Government's interest including the function involved and the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
fiscal or administrative burdens that the additional procedural 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requirements would entail. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The private interest at stake is payment of a civil penalty. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The maximum amount that may be assessed, $5,000 per day of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
violation, is significantly less than the penalty that may be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
assessed under the other civil penalty authorities in the Act. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition, EPA's proposed rules would establish a maximum 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
amount that might be assessed in any one citation. It is also 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
expected that the actual penalties assessed per violation will 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
generally be less than the statutory maximum. The circumstances 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
expected in the great majority of cases is a proper focus for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
assessing due process concerns.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 873 F.2d 1477, 1484 (D.C. Cir. 1989). In 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
addition, the straightforward and simple hearing procedures 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proposed would minimize the cost for private parties to contest 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
assessment of a field citation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The procedures proposed in this third option should minimize 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the risk of an erroneous deprivation of property. Under the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proposed rules, a respondent would be served with a citation that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
clearly identified the alleged violation and provided a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reasonable opportunity to request a hearing. If a hearing was 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requested, it would be presided over by a neutral agency official 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that had no prior connection with the action, including 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
investigative or prosecutorial functions. The Presiding Officer 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
also would have no interest in the outcome of the action. This 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
offers the respondent a hearing before a neutral and unbiased 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
tribunal, and clearly minimizes any risk of error from 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
institutional or other bias. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The parties have the right to discover, before the hearing, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
all the information necessary to provide for a fair and adequate 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
hearing. Parties may obtain the names of all witnesses that will 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
be presented, along with a brief description of the witnesses 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
qualifications and the subject matter of the testimony, and they 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
may obtain each document that will be introduced by the other 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
party. Since the violations involved will be minor in nature and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
are expected to typically involve simple and straightforward 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
factual and legal circumstances, this should provide a respondent 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
with all the information needed to adequately contest a citation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition, the citation would typically have been issued 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
immediately upon or shortly after the violation is detected, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
providing respondents with ample opportunity to investigate the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
circumstances of an alleged violation. In these circumstances, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
additional discovery would not be expected to significantly 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
advance the accuracy of the final decision.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The hearing allowed under the proposed rules would provide 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
respondents with several options in presenting relevant evidence, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
limited by the authority of the Presiding Officer to determine 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the manner of testimony that is most efficient in resolving an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
issue. Written and oral testimony are both acceptable, as well 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
as testimony provided by other means. Respondents may offer any 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
facts, statements, explanations, documents, testimony or other 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
exculpatory evidence that is relevant to issues at the hearing. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A right of cross-examination is provided, although EPA is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
considering limiting cross-examination to situations determined 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
appropriate by the Presiding Officer. This form of hearing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
clearly meets the requirements of section 113(d)(3), and provides 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
respondents with a fair opportunity to present evidence and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
argument on relevant issues. Given the simple and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
straightforward nature of the minor violations expected in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
program, additional procedures would not significantly reduce the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
risk of an erroneous imposition of a civil penalty. A right to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
cross-examine witnesses, as compared to limiting cross 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
examination to situations where deemed appropriate by the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Presiding Officer, would allow for additional cross-examination 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
only where the Presiding Officer, a neutral official, had already 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
determined it was inappropriate. A right to cross-examination 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
would increase the accuracy of the hearing only in those limited 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
cases where a Presiding Officer had mistakenly denied crossexamination. EPA expects this kind of mistake would occur

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
infrequently, and a right to cross-examine, therefore, would not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
significantly increase the accuracy of the proceedings in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
great bulk of cases. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Presiding Officer is afforded substantial discretion to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
tailor the hearing procedures to the individual facts and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
circumstances of each case. The Presiding Officer, may, for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
example, hold prehearing conferences, regulate the course of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
hearing, including the form and extent of testimony and crossexamination, take official notice of matters, and request
a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
written statement from the parties post-hearing. This 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
flexibility should increase the accuracy of the proceedings, and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reduce the value of mandating additional procedures. See 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Chemical Waste Management, 873 F.2d at 1483. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
After the hearing, parties may submit written statements to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the Presiding Officer, such as recommended findings of fact and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
conclusions of law, at the discretion of the Presiding Officer. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Presiding Officer then prepares and transmits a recommended 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
decision that is forwarded to the Regional Administrator for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
issuance of a final decision. There is no administrative appeal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to the Administrator, except the Board may review a decision sua 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
sponte. This provides for at least one level of review above the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Presiding Officer, and in some cases a second level of review by 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the Board, establishing a clear mechanism to correct potential 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
errors in the recommended decision. It should also promote 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
consistency within a region, as well as national consistency if 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and when issues of national importance arise.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Additional procedures, such as a right to comment on the recommended decision, would not significantly add to the
accuracy of these procedures. Respondents would already have had a full 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
opportunity to present their position on the issues at the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
hearing, and could submit proposed findings and conclusions at 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the request of the Presiding Officer. All of this would be in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the administrative record, and available to the Regional 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Administrator. Additional right to comment would not be expected 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to be of significant benefit, given the minor nature of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
factual and legal issues involved. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The government's primary interest, as previously described, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
is to implement an effective citation program without an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
unnecessary drain on limited enforcement resources. An effective 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
program calls for issuance of a citation immediately or shortly 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
after detection of a violation, with a final resolution 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
accomplished shortly after issuance of the citation. This will 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
maximize the deterrent effect of the field citation program, and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
minimize the amount of resources necessary to achieve this goal. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed hearing procedures meet these objectives by using 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
simplified and streamlined procedures, with a relatively limited 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
time needed to complete all procedures necessary to a final 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
decision on assessment of a penalty. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Since the field citation program fills a gap in EPA's 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
enforcement program, it is reasonable to expect that a large 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
number of citations will be issued in each region, addressing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
simple, easy to prove violations and assessing small monetary 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
penalties. While the nature of the violations and the penalty 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
should act to limit the number of hearings requested by 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
respondents, it is reasonable to expect that a significant number 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of hearings may be requested if EPA issues a large number of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
citations. In that context, any additional procedures run the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
risk of significantly increasing the administrative burden and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
length of field citation proceedings. This could quickly make 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the program inefficient and a drain on government resources, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
given the small potential penalties and the limited environmental 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
concerns involved for most minor violations.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Field citations will be of a standardized format nationwide, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and will be issued in triplicate. The following information 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
shall be included on the field citation: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Date and time of violation(s); 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Inspector's name, title, and office; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Name and address of source; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) Name and telephone number of owner/operator or his/her 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
representative; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5) Specific violation(s); 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(6) Location/source/description of violation(s); 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(7) Proposed penalty; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(8) Notification of the 30-day deadline to either pay the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
penalty or request a hearing; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(9) Address to which payment must be sent; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(10) Address to which a request for a hearing must be sent; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(11) Inspector's signature; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(12) Space for signature indicating receipt; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(13) Citation number. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The actual format of the citation will be published in the

developed in this part will be used in administering the field 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

E. Section 59.5&blank;Determination of Minor Violation and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Maximum Proposed Penalty 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This section describes the process that will be used to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
determine whether a violation is minor. Each violation will be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
evaluated according to the proposed list of factors provided. A 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
violation will be determined as minor through evaluation of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
factors, considered as a whole. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Criminal violations will not be addressed under the field 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
citations program. Criminal enforcement action may be pursued 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for the violations described in section 113(c). These violations 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
include ``knowing'' violations such as knowing endangerment, in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
which a person knowingly releases a hazardous air pollutant, with 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the knowledge that the release is placing another person in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
imminent danger of death or serious bodily injury. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This section also provides the proposed maximum civil 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
penalty for a minor violation as $5,000 per day of violation, and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
defines a field citation's total proposed penalty as the sum of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
each individual minor violation's proposed penalty.

A. Executive Order 12866 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Under Executive Order 12866, (58 FR 51735 (October 4, 1993)) the Agency must determine whether the regulatory action
is ``significant'' and therefore subject to OMB review and the requirements of the Executive Order. The Order defines
``significant regulatory action'' as one that is likely to result in a rule that may: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Have an annual effect on the economy of $100 million or more or adversely affect in a material way the economy, productivity,
competition, jobs, the environment, public health or safety, or State, local, or tribal governments or communities;

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Create a serious inconsistency or otherwise interfere with an action taken or planned by another agency; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Materially alter the budgetary impact of entitlements, grants, user fees, or loan programs or the rights and obligations
of recipients thereof; or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) Raise novel legal or policy issues arising out of legal mandates, the President's priorities, or the principles
set forth in the Executive Order. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Pursuant to the terms of Executive Order 12866, it has been determined that this rule is a ``significant regulatory
action.'' As such, this action was submitted to OMB for review. Changes made in response to OMB suggestions or recommendations
will be documented in the public record.

B. Regulatory Flexibility Act 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Pursuant to the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 601 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et seq.,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 whenever an agency is required to publish a general notice of rulemaking for any proposed or final rule, it must prepare
and make available for public comment a regulatory flexibility analysis that describes the impact of the rule on small
entities (i.e., small businesses, small organizations, and small governmental jurisdictions). The Administrator
may certify, however, that the rule will not have a significant impact on a substantial number of small entities. In
such circumstances, a regulatory flexibility analysis is not required. The expected impact of this proposed rule
is negligible. The rule creates no new requirements, small or large, and is procedural in nature. Accordingly, I hereby
certify that these proposed regulations will not have a significant impact on a substantial number of small entities.
These regulations, therefore, do not require a regulatory flexibility analysis.

documents, testimony or other exculpatory evidence which bears on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
appropriate issues, or which may be relevant to the size of an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
appropriate penalty. Any opposing party has a right of crossexamination after the introduction of a witness' direct

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
testimony. A party shall not cross-examine regarding a matter 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that is outside of the scope of the direct examination. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Presiding Officer may require the authentication of any written 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
exhibit or statement. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) At the close of the respondent's presentation of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
evidence, the Presiding Officer may allow the introduction of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
rebuttal evidence by the Agency representative. The Presiding 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Officer may allow the respondent to respond to any such evidence 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
submitted by the Agency. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(d) In receiving evidence, the Presiding Officer is not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
bound by the Federal Rules of Evidence. In evaluating the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
evidence presented, the Presiding Officer shall give due 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
consideration to the reliability and relevance of each item of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
evidence. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(e) The Presiding Officer may take notice of matters which 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
are not subject to reasonable dispute and are commonly known in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the community, or are capable of accurate and ready determination 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
by resort to sources whose accuracy cannot reasonably be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
questioned. Prior to taking notice of a matter, the Presiding 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Officer shall give each party an opportunity to show why notice 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
should not be taken. In any case in which notice is taken, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Presiding Officer shall place in the record a written statement 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of the matter as to which notice was taken with the basis for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
such notice, including either a statement that the parties 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
consented to notice being taken or a summary of any party's 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
objections.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(a) The Presiding Officer shall consider the following 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
criteria in reviewing the penalty proposed in the field citation: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) The size of the business; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) The economic impact of the penalty on the business; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) The respondent's full compliance history, and good faith 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
efforts by the respondent to comply; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) The duration of the violation as established by any 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
credible evidence (including evidence other than the applicable 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
test method); 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5) Payment by the respondent of penalties previously 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
assessed for the same violation; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(6) The economic benefit of noncompliance; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(7) The seriousness of the violation; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(8) Such other factors as justice may require. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) The burden of going forward with respect to criteria in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
paragraphs (a)(1), (2), (3), (5), and (6) of this section, is on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the respondent. The burden of going forward with respect to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
criteria in paragraphs (a)(4) and (7) of this section is on the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Agency. The burden of going forward with respect to criterion in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
paragraph (a)(8) of this section is on the party proffering such 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
factors. Failure of the respondent to meet its burden with 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
respect to any applicable criterion shall mean that a penalty 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
amount that is appropriate in light of other criteria shall also 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
be appropriate in light of such criterion for which the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
respondent failed to meet its burden.

the Presiding Officer if deemed necessary to permit a full and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
fair review and resolution of the case. If not so ordered by the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Presiding Officer, a party may, at its own expense, cause a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
verbatim transcript to be made. The party causing the verbatim

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(a) Within a reasonable time after the conclusion of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
hearing, the Presiding Officer shall: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Certify the administrative record as complete; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Make the administrative record available to the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Regional Administrator; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Prepare and transmit a recommended decision to the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Regional Administrator. The recommended decision shall address 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
all material issues of fact or law properly raised by the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
respondent, and shall recommend that the field citation be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
affirmed, modified or withdrawn. The recommended decision shall 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
be based on substantial evidence in the administrative record, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
taken as a whole, and shall provide citations to relevant 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
material contained in that record. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) The Presiding Officer shall file a copy of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
recommended decision with the Hearing Clerk at the time of its 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
transmittal to the Regional Administrator. The Hearing Clerk 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
shall immediately serve each party with a copy of the recommended 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
decision.

Decision of the regional administrator. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(a) Following receipt of the recommended decision, the Regional Administrator shall issue a final decision that
either affirms, reverses, or modifies the recommended decision or remands the case to the Presiding Officer for further
proceedings. The Regional Administrator's decision may compromise, modify, or remit the penalty requested by the
recommended decision, with or without conditions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) If the Regional Administrator rejects the recommendation of the Presiding Officer, in whole or in part, the decision
shall include a written explanation for that rejection that states each point of disagreement with the recommendation
of the Presiding Officer. If the Regional Administrator determines that the proposed penalty assessment must be
withdrawn, such action may be done without prejudice. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) The Regional Administrator's decision shall be supported by clear reasons and by the administrative record and
shall include a statement of the right to judicial review and of the procedures and deadlines for obtaining judicial
review. The decision shall be comprised of the Regional Administrator's findings of fact, conclusions of law, and
assessment of an appropriate penalty after taking into account all applicable statutory and penalty factors. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(d) For purposes of appeal, the final decision of the Regional Administrator pursuant to this part shall be deemed
issued five (5) days following the date of mailing of the decision to the respondent. The final decision becomes effective
thirty (30) days following its date of issuance unless an appeal is taken pursuant to section 113(d)(4) of the Clean
Air Act, 42 U.S.C. 7413(d)(4) before that date. The issuance of the final decision by the Regional Administrator pursuant
to this section constitutes final Agency action on its effective date.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Environmental Appeals Board may, on its own initiative, within thirty (30) days of the date of issuance by the Regional
Administrator of a final decision pursuant to &sect;59.23, suspend implementation of such decision for the purpose
of reviewing its conclusions of law or its sufficiency under &sect;59.23(c). The Environmental Appeals Board, after
such review, may amend its conclusions of law, withdraw the field citation, remand the case for appropriate action
to the Regional Administrator, or may allow the decision to issue unchanged. In any action in which the Environmental
Appeals Board acts pursuant to this section, the provisions of &sect;59.23 shall apply, except that: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(a) The Regional Administrator who issued the final decision shall be deemed the recommending Presiding Officer
for purposes of &sect;59.22; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) Upon suspension of the final decision, the Environmental Appeals Board shall be deemed the Regional Administrator
for purposes of &sect;59.23; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) The Regional Administrator's decision, except for its findings of fact, shall be deemed a recommended decision;
the Regional Administrator's findings of fact are findings for purposes of this part and are not subject to review
by the Environmental Appeals Board; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(d) If the Environmental Appeals Board does not amend the Regional Administrator's conclusions of law nor determine
that the order is insufficient under &sect;59.23(c), the Regional Administrator's penalty determination is not
subject to review. If the Environmental Appeals Board amends the Regional Administrator's conclusions of law or
determines insufficiency, the Regional Administrator's penalty determination shall be remanded by the Environmental
Appeals Board to the Regional Administrator for appropriate action, except that if the Environmental Appeals Board
determines that the respondent is not liable for the violations alleged under applicable law, then the Environmental
Appeals Board shall withdraw the field citation and the final decision of the Regional Administrator without remand;

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(e) If the Environmental Appeals Board allows the final decision to issue unchanged, the requirements of &sect;59.23(c)
shall not apply; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(f) If the Environmental Appeals Board amends or remands the decision, the requirements of &sect;59.23(c) to make
findings of fact and to assess the appropriate penalty shall not apply; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(g) The Environmental Appeals Board's decision to suspend implementation of a final decision shall not be deemed
final Agency action for the purposes of &sect;59.23(d).

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 This proposed rule sets forth criteria and procedures for the granting of awards as authorized by an amendment to the
Clean Air Act (the Act). The amendments added section 113(f) to the Act, which authorizes the Administrator of the
Environmental Protection Agency discretion to pay an award, not to exceed $10,000, to any person who furnishes information
or services which lead to a criminal conviction or a judicial or administrative civil penalty enforced under section
113 of the Act for a violation of titles I, III, IV, V, or VI of the Act, as amended. Section 113(f) also authorizes the
Administrator to prescribe, by regulation, additional criteria for eligibility for such an award. This proposed
rule sets forth such additional criteria for eligibility. In addition, this proposal establishes procedures to
petition the Agency for consideration for an award, including what information must be submitted in such petitions,
and describes award criteria. This proposed rule also provides an assurance of confidentiality as to the identity
of persons who provide information or services on a confidential basis. Furthermore, to implement the goal of the
program, this rule provides direction for providing information or services regarding potential violations.

I. Statutory Requirements 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 113(f) of the Clean Air Act, as amended, (the Act), 42 U.S.C. 7413(f), authorizes the Administrator discretion
to pay awards to persons who provide information or services regarding potential violations of the Act. Pursuant
to section 113(f), the information or services must result in a criminal conviction or a judicial or administrative
civil penalty for a violation of titles I, III, IV, V, or VI of the Act, enforced under section 113 of the Act, before an
award may be issued. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The statute specifically authorizes awards only for enforcement actions brought under section 113 of the Act. Thus,
information or services which assist actions brought under State law (e.g, enforcement of SIPs under State law or
citizen suits brought under State law), under other sections of the Act (i.e., citizen suits under section 304), or
under other statutes, do not qualify for an award under this provision. However, in cases where the Agency intervenes,
overfiles, or otherwise takes over the enforcement action under the authority of section 113, the awards authority
may become applicable.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Under section 113(f) of the Act, any officer or employee of the United States or any State or local government who furnishes
information or renders services to the Agency in the performance of an official duty is ineligible for an award. Also,
section 113(f) authorizes the Administrator to prescribe, by regulation, additional criteria for eligibility
for an award. In response, the regulation proposed today prescribes additional criteria for eligibility. The regulation
proposed today also prescribes general criteria for the Agency to consider in determining whether and how much of
an award is appropriate and procedures to be followed by persons who want to be considered for an award. Additional
authority for these provisions is provided by section 301(a) of the Act.

II. The Proposal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Today's proposed rule prescribes regulations for EPA's awards authority under section 113(f) of the Clean Air Act,
as amended, 42 U.S.C. 7413(f). The proposed rule sets forth general eligibility criteria, criteria to be used in considering
petitions for awards, the procedures for petitioning consideration for an award, and other matters designed to assist
the Administrator in exercising her discretion in this area. The goal of this proposal is to assist in the implementation
of an awards program that would encourage citizens to cooperate with and voluntarily assist the EPA's Clean Air Act
enforcement efforts and thereby deter violations. Inherent in a program for awards are concerns regarding the confidentiality
of the identity of those who provide information or services and the need to evaluate the quality of such information
or services. This proposal is intended to address those concerns.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
A. Application of Proposal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The EPA intends that this proposed regulation will apply only after promulgation. Petitions for an award based on
information or services provided to the EPA after the passage of the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990 (the Amendments)
but before the regulation is promulgated may be processed using the proposed criteria as nonbinding guidance. The
EPA will not consider a petition for an award based on information or services provided entirely prior to enactment
of the Amendments. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
B. Eligibility Criteria 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As discussed above, section 113(f) renders certain persons ineligible for an award, and also authorizes the Administrator
to prescribe additional eligibility criteria. In response, this proposed rule categorically excludes EPA employees
from eligibility to receive an award. The proposed regulation further delineates eligibility limits for employees
of, and others who have a contractual relationship with, federal, State, or local governments. Thus under the proposal,
officers, employees, contractors, and grantees will be ineligible to receive an award if at the time they come into
possession of the information or render services which constitute, in whole or in part, the basis of the award, they
were performing an official duty. Furthermore, any members of the immediate family of those ``performing their official
duty'' are likewise ineligible. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The EPA believes these provisions will help ensure that employees and others contractually obligated to the EPA or
other governmental entities will fulfill their obligation and will not withhold information that they would otherwise
provide to the government. The proposed provisions also address the concern that such persons could indirectly benefit
by passing information obtained while performing their official duty to family members, who could then use that information
to petition for an award. The concern addressed here is protection of the integrity of compliance and enforcement
activities. By declaring such persons ineligible for an award, the proposed regulation seeks to ensure that the awards
program will not create an incentive for employees to abuse access to information and authority otherwise unavailable
to the public. The term ``immediate family member'' is purposely not defined in the proposed regulation, as the EPA
prefers to maintain its discretion in referencing other sources of law and otherwise evaluating the circumstances
of the particular case in making its award determination. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
So that persons who may receive awards are aware that certain persons are ineligible to be paid an award, the proposal
requires that a certificate of eligibility be signed by the person before the Administrator may pay the award. This
requirement assists the EPA in assuring that an award is not paid to ineligible persons. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
C. Addresses for Tips 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Tips from citizens to the US EPA and State and local air pollution control agencies provide useful information on the
possible existence or extent of a violation. Since the goal of the awards program is to encourage citizens to cooperate
with and voluntarily assist EPA enforcement efforts, the proposal provides the addresses to which information may
be sent. The information or services provided may or may not lead to eligibility for an award. Providing such information
does not create an obligation on the Agency to issue an award, or vest in any person a right to such award. Nevertheless,
the Administrator encourages all persons to provide any information they have regarding violations of the Act to
the appropriate persons listed in Appendix A. Such information improves the Agency's ability to enforce the Act.
The EPA encourages persons to provide the information or services to State and local agencies as well. Although completion
of an enforcement action by a State or local agency under authority other than section 113 of the Clean Air Act cannot
lead to an award paid by the U.S. EPA under section 113(f), it is important that information be provided to State and
local agencies. In most situations, the U.S. EPA will defer to State enforcement authorities to address violations
in a timely and appropriate manner. However, persons who provide information or services to a State or local agency
may become eligible for an award if the EPA overfiles or otherwise takes over the enforcement action.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
D. Confidentiality 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Because today's proposal contemplates the EPA receiving and using information and services from private sources
for enforcement activities, the EPA is also proposing to maintain as confidential, upon request, the identity of
persons providing information or services. The EPA believes this assurance of confidentiality will encourage persons
to assist the EPA in its efforts to enforce compliance with the Act. In this regard, the proposed rule provides, upon
request, confidential treatment by the EPA consistent with this proposal, existing law and other EPA regulations.
Pursuant to the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA), 5 U.S.C. 552 (b)(6) &amp; (7), the confidentiality of the identity
of those providing information and services will be protected from FOIA requests consistent with existing law. The
assurance of confidentiality extends to petitions for awards submitted to the EPA. To ensure confidential treatment
of such petitions, it is important that persons submitting petitions to the EPA specifically request confidentiality
at or prior to the time of providing information or services, and to renew such request at the time of submitting a petition.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
E. Petitions for Awards 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Because the information or services provided would be instrumental to the successful prosecution of the EPA's enforcement
action, in many cases EPA personnel will be aware of persons potentially eligible for an award, even without a petition
being submitted. The EPA expects that in many such situations, award determinations may be made without submission
of a petition. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Today's proposal recognizes, however, that a person may wish to petition the Agency for consideration for an award
and authorizes such petitions. To ensure that such petitions contain sufficient information for the purpose of evaluation,
and to ensure that petitions are directed to the appropriate EPA office, the proposal sets forth award petition procedures
and requirements. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
Timing of Petitions 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposed rule requires petitions for consideration to be submitted in writing no later than one year after the
judgment of conviction or assessment of a civil penalty. Petitions may be submitted at any time prior to the judgment
or assessment, but no award determination will be made before the judgment of conviction is entered or a judicial or
administrative civil penalty is finally assessed, agreed, or ordered. Again, payment and the amount of any award
granted is within the Administrator's unfettered discretion. The granting of an award is a gratuity, and not an entitlement.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
Certification of Eligibility 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposed regulation also requires that the petition contain a certification of compliance with the eligibility
criteria set forth in the regulation. A statement signed by the person to be considered for an award attesting to having
read the eligibility requirements and attesting that the person to be considered for an award is not ineligible to
receive an award would meet this requirement. This certification is important to the award determination process
because the EPA recognizes that it may be difficult for the Administrator to determine with certainty whether a person
meets all eligibility criteria. However, the Act prohibits payment of an award to certain persons. Therefore, the
proposal requires a certification of eligibility be signed before the Administrator may pay an award.

F. Criteria for Awards 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Under the Act, the Administrator has discretionary 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
authority whether to pay an award and to determine the amount of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
an award. The proposed regulation does not constrain this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
discretion. Although the proposed rule permits petitions for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
consideration for an award, whether an award is ultimately 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
granted will turn on the exercise of the Administrator
<!-- PJG 0034 unknown -->
s 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
unfettered discretion, including the application of factors 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
described in this proposed regulation. These factors include 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
whether the information or services constituted the initial, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
unsolicited notice of the violation to the government, whether 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the government would have obtained knowledge of the violation in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a timely manner absent the information or services, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
importance of the case, the severity of the violation, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
potential for or existence of actual or threatened harm to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
persons or the environment, the willingness to assist in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
government
<!-- PJG 0034 unknown -->
s enforcement action(s) regarding the violation(s), 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the value of the assistance in comparison to that given by any 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
other persons or sources of information or services and, in part, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the amount of money available to the EPA through appropriations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Furthermore, the rule is not intended to discourage self-auditing within facilities nor is it intended to encourage

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
concealment of information about violations or problems within a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
facility by an employee from an employer. Thus, the regulation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
sets forth the additional criterion of whether payment of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
award would improperly create incentives against the timely and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
appropriate identification of such a violation to either the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
employer or the government. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

G. Timing of Award Consideration 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As mandated by section 113(f), persons may not be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
considered for an award unless and until such time as the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
information or services provided leads to a judicial or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
administrative civil penalty or a criminal conviction under 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
section 113 of the Act.

H. Prepayment Offers 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposed regulation makes clear the distinction 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
between the Awards program and paid informant programs or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
contractual relationships that may be created by the Agency. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA's employees do not have the authority under this proposal or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
this statutory provision to promise that an award will be paid 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
nor to promise consideration or recommendation for an award. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

I. Request for Public Comment 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The EPA is interested in public comment on all aspects of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
this proposed rule. The EPA is particularly interested in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
comments on: (1) The provision for confidentiality of identity 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for persons who provide information or services; (2) the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
eligibility exclusions and eligibility criteria for an award; (3) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
petitions for consideration; and (4) the criteria for awards 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
determinations.

III. Administrative Requirements 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
A. Executive Order 12866
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Under Executive Order 12866, (58 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FR 51735 (October 4, 1993)) the Agency must 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
determine whether the regulatory action is ``significant'' and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
therefore subject to OMB review and the requirements of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Executive Order. The Order defines ``significant regulatory 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
action'' as one that is likely to result in a rule that may: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Have an annual effect on the economy of $100 million or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
more or adversely affect in a material way the economy, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
productivity, competition, jobs, the environment, public health 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
or safety, or State, local, or tribal governments or communities; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Create a serious inconsistency or otherwise interfere 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
with an action taken or planned by another agency; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Materially alter the budgetary impact of entitlements, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
grants, user fees, or loan programs or the rights and obligations 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of recipients thereof; or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) Raise novel legal or policy issues arising out of legal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
mandates, the President's priorities, or the principles set forth 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in the Executive Order. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Pursuant to the terms of Executive Order 12866, it has been 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
determined that this rule is a ``significant regulatory action''. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As such, this action was submitted to OMB for review. Changes 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
made in response to OMB suggestions or recommendations will be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
documented in public record. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

B. Regulatory Flexibility Act Compliance 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Pursuant to the provisions of 5 U.S.C. 605(b), I hereby certify 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that this attached rule, if promulgated, will not have an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
economic impact on small entities because no additional costs 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
will be incurred.

Since this proposed rule does not create any new information

requirements or contain any new information collection 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
activities, no clearance is necessary from OMB under the

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(a) This regulation implements section 113(f), 42 U.S.C. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
7413(f), the ``citizen award'' provision of the Clean Air Act, as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
amended (the Act). As authorized in section 113(f), of the Act the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Administrator of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Agency) is authorized to pay up to $10,000, as may be available 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
from appropriations, to any person who provides information or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
services leading to a criminal conviction or a judicial or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
administrative civil penalty, enforced under section 113, for any 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
violation of Titles I, III, IV, V, or VI of the Act. The goal of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the program is to encourage citizens to cooperate with and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
voluntarily assist the Agency's enforcement efforts and thereby 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
deter noncompliance. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) Providing information or services to the Agency by any 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
person does not create any obligation on the Administrator to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
issue an award or to pay compensation for such assistance. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Neither the Act nor these regulations create an entitlement to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the payment of an award. The determinations whether to pay an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
award, and in what amount, are matters which remain by statute in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the exclusive and unfettered discretion of the Administrator.

<SUMMARY>
<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 -->
SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The EPA is proposing to amend the reformulated gasoline regulations to define criteria and procedures by which foreign
refiners establish individual refinery baselines that reflect the properties and volume of the gasoline that was
produced at a foreign refinery in 1990 and imported for use within the United States. EPA is seeking comments on a wide
range of matters in this proposal, including the air quality effects of the proposed approach. Where the requisite
showing is made through a petition process, importers of reformulated gasoline produced at the foreign refinery
would be allowed to use the individual foreign refinery baseline values to demonstrate compliance with the reformulated
gasoline standards with regard to gasoline produced at that foreign refinery and imported into the United States
only during the period 1995 through 1997 and only up to a volume of gasoline each year that equals the foreign refinery's
1990 import volume, and subject to certain limitations and conditions that are proposed as well. This amendment would
allow imported reformulated gasoline to be evaluated relative to individual refinery baselines in a manner that
is similar to that applicable to reformulated gasoline produced at domestic refineries. Individual foreign refinery
baselines could be used only with reformulated gasoline under this proposal, and such baselines could not be used
with conventional gasoline. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
EPA specifically states that it seeks comments on the proposed approach for foreign refinery baselines and on any
underlying assumptions, as well as any other options for regulating imported reformulated gasoline that would be
fair to all regulated parties and would achieve the environmental benefits intended for reformulated gasoline by
the Clean Air Act.

Background 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
On December 15, 1993 the EPA Administrator issued the final regulations implementing the reformulated gasoline
and anti-dumping programs (the Final Rule), as prescribed by section 211(k) of the Clean Air Act (the Act). See 59 FR
7716 (February 16, 1994). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under the final rule, compliance by refiners and importers with certain reformulated gasoline and anti-dumping
standards is measured against baselines that are intended to reflect 1990 gasoline quality. Domestic refiners are
required to establish individual refinery baselines of the quality and quantity of the gasoline that was produced
by the refiner in 1990. Domestic refinery baselines must be calculated using, in hierarchical order based on the availability
of data, 1990 gasoline test data (Method 1), 1990 blendstock test data (Method 2), or post-1990 blendstock and/or
gasoline test data (Method 3). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under the rule, domestic importers of foreign-refined gasoline are treated differently. They are required to establish
baselines of the quality and quantity of 1990 gasoline that they import using 1990 gasoline test data (Method 1) if
available. If Method 1 data are not available, importers are assigned a baseline approximating average gasoline
quality in the United States in 1990_the statutory baseline.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 EPA anticipates that most importers, like most domestic refiners, lack the actual 1990 testing data necessary to
establish a baseline using Method 1. As a result, EPA expects most importers will be assigned the statutory baseline,
with the consequence that most gasoline produced at foreign refineries will be evaluated using the statutory baseline.
The baseline-setting scheme is specified in 40 CFR 80.91 through 80.93 and is discussed in the Preamble to the final
rule at 59 FR 7791 (February 16, 1994).

The ``statutory'' baseline is calculated pursuant to section 211(k)(10)(B) of the Act which defines the statutory
baseline for summertime gasoline and instructs the Administrator to establish the properties of the statutory baseline
for wintertime gasoline based on average 1990 qualities of wintertime gasoline. EPA's Final Rule specifies the properties
of the statutory baseline for wintertime gasoline in &sect;80.45(b)(2), and annual statutory baseline gasoline
properties in &sect;80.91(c)(5).

Before January 1, 1998, refiners and importers have the option of certifying reformulated gasoline using either
the ``simple'' model or ``early use of the complex model.'' Under either of these reformulated gasoline certification
approaches, compliance with certain standards is determined in relation to the baseline established for each refinery
or importer. Under the simple model, the annual average levels for sulfur, T&hyph;90, and olefins are limited to each
refinery's or importer's baseline levels for these parameters.

The reformulated gasoline ``simple'' model requirements include standards for oxygen, benzene, RVP, and toxics

Beginning on January 1, 1998, only the complex model may be used to certify reformulated gasoline, and the basis for
all compliance with the reformulated gasoline complex model standards is determined in relation to 1990 statutory
baseline gasoline. See &sect;&sect;80.41(i)(2)&hyph;(i)(3). As a result, beginning in 1998 refiner or importer
baselines are no longer relevant to determining compliance with reformulated gasoline standards. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Compliance with the standards for conventional gasoline (the ``anti-dumping'' standards) is measured against
refinery or importer baselines beginning in January 1995 and thereafter. See &sect;80.101. As a result of the baseline-setting
requirements of the final rule discussed above, domestic refiners would determine compliance with the anti-dumping
standards in relation to refinery-specific baselines, while most or all importers of gasoline produced at foreign
refineries would determine compliance in relation to the statutory baseline.

In developing the final rule, EPA evaluated comments regarding the proposed approach for establishing baselines
for imported gasoline, including comments submitted on behalf of Petroleos de Venezuela, S.A. (PDVSA), the Venezuelan
national oil company, in response to the April 16, 1992 reformulated gasoline proposal, at 57 FR 13416. In their comments,
PDVSA said that the proposal for imported gasoline baselines is unfair in that it treats domestic and foreign refiners
differently. PDVSA also stated in its comments that this difference in treatment of domestic and foreign refiners
conflicted with the requirements of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT). EPA officials held a series
of meetings on the foreign refiner baseline issue during the Fall of 1992 and during 1993. These included meetings
with PDVSA officials, regarding whether PDVSA has the data necessary to establish a baseline of the quality of its
gasoline that was used in the United States in 1990, and whether EPA could formulate an adequate enforcement scheme
for a program that included individual foreign refinery baselines. EPA also met with domestic refiners on this issue,
to hear their concerns, and with representatives of other agencies, primarily officials from the Office of the U.S.
Trade Representative and the State Department, to better understand the GATT requirements. EPA's February 26, 1993
reformulated gasoline proposal also invited comment on these issues. See 58 FR 11758. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As a result of these comments and meetings, EPA considered provisions allowing foreign refiners to establish individual
refinery baselines in a manner similar to that required for domestic refiners. See discussion in the Preamble to the
final rule at 59 FR 7785&hyph;7788 (February 16, 1994). EPA was not prepared to adopt such provisions by the court ordered
deadline for the final rule of December 15, 1993, but it stated at that time that it would continue to consider this issue
and continue discussions with PDVSA. Since issuance of the final rule, EPA has continued to consider this question,
including the relationship of the GATT and the reformulated gasoline rule, and is seeking comments on its proposal
in this notice to allow foreign refiners to establish individual refinery baselines under limited circumstances.
While EPA does not necessarily agree with PDVSA position on GATT requirements, EPA desires to remove the uncertainty
in this regard and we believe the proposal does that in a manner fully protective of human health and the environment.

II. The Proposed Limited Use of Individual Foreign Refinery Baselines 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Under today's proposal, importers would be allowed limited use of a baseline established for an individual foreign
refinery to demonstrate compliance with the reformulated gasoline standards for gasoline produced at that foreign
refinery and imported for use in the United States. The use of individual foreign refinery baselines would be conditioned
and limited in the following ways: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;EPA would have to specifically approve the baseline for the foreign refinery. In order to obtain a baseline,
the foreign refiner would have to submit a petition to EPA, which would include the same types of gasoline and blendstock
testing data and refinery modelling analyses that domestic refiners must submit. In addition, a foreign refiner
would have to support its baseline petition with a report prepared by an independent baseline auditor, and like for
domestic refiners EPA would have to approve the auditor. One key aspect of a foreign refiner's baseline petition is
that it would have to conclusively establish the quality and volume of gasoline that was used in the United States in
1990, and not just the refinery's overall gasoline quality in 1990. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Individual foreign refinery baselines could be used by importers only to demonstrate compliance with reformulated
gasoline standards and only prior to January 1, 1998. They could not be used to demonstrate compliance with anti-dumping
standards. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;The total volume of imported reformulated gasoline that could be subject to the individual baseline for any
foreign refinery would be limited each year to the volume of that refinery's gasoline used in the United States in 1990.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;The importer would be required to establish that any imported gasoline that would be subject to an individual
foreign refinery baseline actually came from that refinery, through gasoline inspections and attest engagements
conducted by independent inspectors and auditors at the foreign refinery. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;EPA inspectors would have to receive full access to the foreign refinery to conduct announced and unannounced
inspections and audits related to the individual foreign refinery's baseline or any gasoline produced at the foreign
refinery.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
These conditions and limits are discussed more fully below. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under the final rule, individual baselines are used to certify reformulated gasoline and demonstrate compliance
with the reformulated gasoline standards only during 1995 through 1997. Beginning January 1, 1998 all reformulated
gasoline compliance must be certified using the statutory baseline. See &sect;&sect;80.41(h)&hyph;(j). This
constraint also would apply to importers of reformulated gasoline who under today's proposal had previously used
individual foreign refinery baselines. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Importers would be able to use an individual foreign refinery baseline for reformulated gasoline for 1995 through
1997 only if all of these conditions and limits are fully met. If any condition is not met with regard to a specific foreign
refinery, then importers would not be allowed to use the foreign refinery's individual baseline. If any such conditions
are not met subsequent to the time the importer uses the individual foreign refinery baseline, then the importer would
be required to recalculate its compliance using the statutory baseline, even if the failure to meet the conditions
occurs during a subsequent averaging period. This potentially could expose the importer to substantial penalties
if subsequent use of the statutory baseline causes the importer to be in non-compliance with the reformulated gasoline
requirements.

Under section 211(d) of the Clean Air Act, violators of the reformulated gasoline requirements and standards are
subject to a maximum penalty of $25,000 per violation per day, plus economic benefit. Violations of multi-day (averaging)
standards constitute a separate day of violation for each day in the averaging period.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
EPA is proposing that importers who use a foreign refinery's individual baseline would use that baseline, and the
volume of the foreign refinery's reformulated gasoline involved, to calculate a new importer baseline for use during
that year. The total of the reformulated gasoline imported by the importer during the relevant averaging period would
then be evaluated against this new importer baseline to determine compliance by the importer with the reformulated
gasoline standards. This proposed method for using foreign refinery baselines is illustrated by the following example.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A hypothetical importer has been assigned the statutory baseline. During 1996 he imports reformulated gasoline
totalling 900,000 barrels of gasoline produced at hypothetical foreign refinery A, and 800,000 barrels of gasoline
produced at hypothetical foreign refinery B. Foreign refiner A has an individual refinery baseline, and the sulfur
baseline level is 400 ppm, and a baseline volume of 1,000,000 barrels.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
5
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Foreign refiner B does not have an individual refinery baseline, and the importer would use the statutory baseline,
which for sulfur is 338 ppm, for the refinery B volume. The average sulfur content of the imported gasoline that was
produced at foreign refinery A was 375 ppm, and the average sulfur content of the imported gasoline that was produced
at foreign refinery B was 360 ppm.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=5 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

</FOOTNAME>
<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->
Because the 1990 baseline volume assigned to Refinery A is greater than 900,000 barrels, the importer may use Refinery
A's individual baseline for all 900,000 barrels imported from that refinery. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
</FOOTNOTE>

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The hypothetical importer would calculate a new sulfur baseline of 370.80 ppm as follows:

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

</IMPORT>

<!-- PJG /STAG -->

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The hypothetical importer then would compute the average sulfur content of all gasoline imported during the year,
of 365.00 ppm, as follows: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

</IMPORT>

<!-- PJG /STAG -->

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
Because the 365.00 ppm overall average sulfur content of the gasoline imported is less than the 370.80 ppm calculated
baseline for the importer, the importer meets the sulfur standard applicable to the importer. Note that the imported
gasoline produced at foreign refinery A would not be required to separately meet the 400 ppm sulfur baseline applicable
to refinery A, and the imported gasoline produced at foreign refinery B would not be required to separately meet the
338 ppm sulfur baseline applicable to refinery B.

A. Establishing Individual Foreign Refinery Baselines 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In order to establish an individual baseline for a foreign refinery under this proposal, a petition would have to be
submitted to EPA in a manner analogous to the baseline submissions required for domestic refiners. The petition would
have to contain the Method 1, Method 2, and/or Method 3 data, collected and evaluated in the same manner as is required
of domestic refiners under &sect;80.91. The baseline data would have to be submitted in the same manner as is required
of domestic refiners under &sect;80.93, except that EPA is proposing to modify the requirements in &sect;80.93 related
to the dates by which baseline submissions are due. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under &sect;80.93 domestic refiners are required to submit data collected before December 15, 1993 by June 1, 1994,
or by September 1, 1994 if data is collected subsequent to December 15, 1993. As a result of the timing of this proposal,
these dates are not reasonable for baseline petitions for foreign refiners. EPA is therefore proposing that any petition
for an individual foreign refinery baseline would be required to be submitted to the Administrator within six months
following the date the individual foreign refinery baseline final regulation is signed. This approach is analogous
to the lead time afforded domestic refiners in the final rule for baseline submissions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Another departure from the baseline submission requirements of &sect;80.93 is that baseline data for foreign refineries
would have to be submitted in such a manner that EPA could determine the quality and quantity of the gasoline produced
at the foreign refinery during 1990 that was used in the United States. Baseline submissions by domestic refiners
are not required to focus on the 1990 U.S. market share of refinery production, because it is assumed that all gasoline
produced at a domestic refinery is used in the United States, unless the refiner shows certain gasoline was exported.
This proposal that foreign refinery baseline petitions would be required to establish U.S. market gasoline quality
and quantity is critical, because the quality of a foreign refinery's U.S. market gasoline in many cases would be different
from the quality of the refinery's overall gasoline quality. Under the proposal, if EPA is unable to determine both
the quality and quantity of the gasoline that was produced by any foreign refinery in 1990 and used in the United States,
the individual foreign refinery baseline petition would be denied. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The accuracy and completeness of the data and conclusions contained in the individual foreign refinery baseline
petition would have to be verified by an independent EPA-approved auditor, in the same manner as is required of domestic
refiners under &sect;80.92. Thus, the auditor would have to be approved by EPA according to the criteria, specified
in &sect;80.92, which include approval of the auditor's independence and technical ability. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA is proposing that a petition for an individual foreign refinery baseline must be submitted by the foreign refiner.
EPA believes the foreign refiner is the most appropriate person to submit such a petition, because it is the foreign
refiner who will possess most or all of the information that would support such a petition. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA also is proposing that the petition must contain a declaration by the owner or president of the foreign refiner
business that the information submitted in the petition is accurate and complete. EPA is further proposing that the
foreign refiner owner or president would be required to affirmatively declare that EPA auditors and inspectors will
be given full and immediate access to all refinery premises, for purposes of compliance with the EPA inspection requirements
EPA has proposed in &sect;80.84(f). The declarations by the foreign refiner owner or president would be mandatory
conditions for EPA approval of any foreign refinery baseline petition. EPA is proposing this declaration requirement
in order to ensure that in each case of a foreign refiner seeking an individual baseline, refiner officials at the highest
levels of the business are aware of the refiner commitments that are necessary for use of a foreign refinery's baseline.

B. Establishing the Refinery-of-Origin 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
EPA is proposing regulatory requirements that would, for any batch of imported gasoline claimed to be subject to an
individual foreign refinery baseline, establish the identity of the foreign refinery at which the gasoline was produced.
The proposed requirements would include the testing of samples of the gasoline in question collected subsequent
to loading into the ship at the port serving the foreign refinery, but before the ship leaves that port. These test results
from the foreign refinery loading point would then be compared with test results of samples of the gasoline in question
collected when the ship arrives at the United States port of entry. Sampling and testing of gasoline at the U.S. port
of entry is required by the final rule, at &sect;&sect;80.65(e)&hyph;(f).

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposed regulations include criteria for evaluating whether the test results of the gasoline samples from the
foreign refinery loading port match the test results of the gasoline samples from the U.S. port of entry. The test results
would have to agree, for each parameter included in the evaluation of reformulated gasoline, within the limits used
for comparing domestic refiner and independent laboratory test results, which are specified in &sect;80.65(f).

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The volume of gasoline contained in each shipment of imported gasoline claimed to be subject to an individual foreign
refinery baseline also would have to be confirmed. The inspection at the foreign refinery loading port would have
to establish the volume loaded onto the ship, which would be compared to the volume determination at the U.S. port of
entry. EPA is proposing that these two volume determinations, corrected for temperature and density, would have
to agree within one percent. EPA believes this level of correlation is appropriate, because it is well within the level
of correlation normally expected in commercial transactions. EPA understands that protests normally are initiated
if ship volume determinations in commercial dealings differ by 0.5%. Nevertheless, EPA requests comment as to the
appropriate level of correlation which should be required, and as to any other approach to confirming volumes that
would be preferable to that proposed. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In the event any single parameter, or the volumes involved, would not agree in the manner proposed, the individual
foreign refinery baseline could not be used by the importer for the specific batch of imported gasoline for which there
is parameter value or volume disagreement. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA believes that in most cases the gasoline contained in each compartment of a ship would constitute a separate batch,
because the gasoline would not be homogeneous across more than one compartment, and would therefore not meet the batch
definition of &sect;80.2(gg). In consequence, EPA believes that in most cases the sampling, testing, and volume
determinations would have to be performed separately for each of a ship's compartments. In addition, it is EPA's understanding
that the current practice for inspecting the gasoline transported by ship is to separately sample each compartment,
even when the same grade of gasoline is being transported in more than one compartment of a ship. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA also is proposing that the independent laboratory would be required to determine the refinery of origin, and thereby
establish whether the gasoline loaded onto the ship was in fact produced at that refinery. The laboratory also would
determine whether the foreign refinery's gasoline has been combined with gasoline produced at any other refinery.
Only gasoline that is produced at the foreign refinery or origin would be eligible for use with the foreign refinery's
baseline, yet it is possible that gasoline loaded onto a ship at a port serving a foreign refinery could have been produced
at a different refinery. For example, two refineries could be linked to a port by a common pipeline, or gasoline could
be produced at a foreign refinery and then transferred by ship to storage tanks located at a second foreign refinery.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed requirements related to determining the refinery of origin would confirm that gasoline loaded into
a ship at the port serving a foreign refinery was in fact produced at the foreign refinery and therefore that the foreign
refinery's individual baseline would be applicable. This confirmation of the source refinery by the independent
inspector normally would require the review of documents that reflect all transfers and storage of the gasoline in
question from the point of production at the source refinery to the point of ship loading. The inspector thus would
be required to establish the refinery of origin and that there was no fungible mixing of the gasoline in question with
any gasoline produced at any other refinery prior to loading onto the ship. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
An additional proposed requirement that relates to establishing the refinery-of-origin for imported gasoline
is the proposal for attest engagements at the foreign refinery. This attest requirement would supplement the requirements
regarding an independent laboratory determination of the source refinery of gasoline. The focus of the attest engagement,
however, would be on the refinery operations while the independent laboratory's primary focus would be on the transportation
and storage of gasoline from the refinery to the point of ship loading. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under the proposed procedures, the attester would be required to confirm the overall production for the refinery
in question, and to confirm that the portion claimed to have been transferred to ships for shipment to the United States
was a part of that overall production. The attester also would be required to confirm the transfer of gasoline from
the refinery to the ships, and to identify the ships into which the gasoline was transferred. EPA requests comment
on whether these proposed attest procedures are appropriate and adequate.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
EPA is proposing that the sampling, testing, and volume determinations at the foreign refinery loading port would
have to be performed by an independent laboratory that is U.S.-based. The proposed criteria for independence are
the same criteria that apply for the independent sampling and testing requirement for domestic refiners and importers,
and that are specified at &sect;80.65(f)(2)(ii). Similarly, EPA is proposing that the attest requirements would
have to be fulfilled by certified public accountants (CPA's) that are United States citizens, or members of a firm
that is a U.S. corporation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed requirements that the independent laboratories and CPA's be U.S.-based is intended to result in laboratories
and CPA's over which EPA may easily exercise jurisdiction. EPA's ability to inspect, obtain judicial enforcement,
or submit information requests under section 114 of the Clean Air Act is significantly more effective in the case of
a person that is a United States citizen or a United States corporation. These enforcement approaches may not be easily
available against non-U.S. corporations or citizens. EPA seeks comment on the proposed requirement that independent
laboratories and CPA's be U.S. corporations or citizens.

C. The Volume Limitation on Use of Individual Foreign Refinery Baselines 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
EPA is proposing that the total volume of imported reformulated gasoline that could be subject to the individual baseline
for any foreign refinery would be limited each year to the volume of that refinery's gasoline that was used in the United
States in 1990. It has been argued that this proposed volume constraint would limit any potential adverse environmental
effects of gasoline imported under individual foreign refinery baselines in comparison to the final rule, as is discussed
more fully below. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed volume constraint would apply separately to each foreign refinery having an individual baseline, and
would apply across all of the importers who import gasoline produced at each foreign refinery. Thus, for example,
if the gasoline produced at a particular foreign refinery having an individual baseline is imported by ten importers
during a specific year, the volume constraint applicable to that foreign refinery would apply to the ten importers
collectively. Any of the hypothetical refinery's gasoline that is imported that year beyond the proposed volume
constraint would be subject to the baseline otherwise applicable to the importer (normally the statutory baseline),
and the individual foreign refinery's baseline would not apply to this excess volume. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA is proposing that the date gasoline is imported would be the criterion for determining which gasoline would qualify
for use of an individual foreign refinery baseline. In the event importers claim use of an individual foreign refinery's
baseline for a volume in excess of the proposed volume constraint, the gasoline that is first imported that equals
the volume constraint would receive use of the individual baseline. Thus, the proposed volume constraint would apply
based on the date the gasoline is imported into the United States, and not based on the date the gasoline is produced.
Beginning on January 1 of each year the volume constraint accounting would begin anew. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA is not proposing any regulatory mechanisms that would provide importers a running accounting of the volume of
a particular foreign refinery's gasoline that has been imported subject to an individual refinery baseline. Moreover,
EPA would not know the total volume of imported gasoline claimed to be subject to any particular foreign refinery's
baseline until quarterly or annual reports are submitted to EPA. EPA expects that importers would make private arrangements
with their foreign refiner business partners to track the volume of each foreign refinery's gasoline that is imported
under each individual foreign refinery's baseline. In this way EPA believes that importers would be able to know whether
any particular batch of imported gasoline would be within the volume constraint that would apply to the foreign refinery
that produced the gasoline. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed consequences for the importer that would result from claiming use of an individual foreign refinery's
baseline beyond the proposed volume constraint are discussed below. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA is proposing that any reformulated gasoline that is imported during 1994 and for which an individual foreign refinery
baseline is used would be combined with such gasoline imported during 1995 for purposes of the proposed volume constraint.
This proposal for combining compliance calculations for gasoline imported during 1994 and 1995 is analogous to the
requirement in the final rule that reformulated gasoline produced or imported in 1994 must be combined with reformulated
gasoline produced or imported in 1995 for determining compliance with average standards. See &sect;80.67(i).

EPA is further proposing to expand the 1990 baseline volume to allow for imports during 1994, but this expanded baseline
volume would apply only for gasoline imported during 1994&hyph;1995. The mechanism proposed for this volume expansion
is to multiply the foreign refinery's 1990 baseline volume times 1.17, which would result in an additional volume
equal to two months of the 1990 baseline volume. EPA believes this approach for expanding the 1990 baseline volume
to cover imports during 1994 is appropriate, because it would allow imports subject to an individual baseline to begin
in November 1994 and to continue at the same rate as would be allowed for 1995. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA requests comment on this proposal for combining gasoline imports in 1994 and 1995 for purposes of applying the
proposed volume constraint on use of an individual foreign refinery's baseline, and on the proposed mechanism for
calculating an expanded 1990 individual foreign refinery baseline volume for use during 1994 and 1995.

D. The Requirement To Allow EPA Inspections and Audits 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
EPA is proposing that, as a condition of use by an importer of an individual foreign refinery's baseline, EPA inspectors
and auditors would have to be given full access to conduct inspections and audits related to the foreign refinery's
baseline and to the gasoline produced at the foreign refinery. The proposed access for inspections and audits would
be at the foreign refinery, at any place gasoline produced at the foreign refinery for the U.S. market is located, and
at any location where documents are kept that relate to the foreign refinery's baseline or to gasoline produced at
the foreign refinery for the U.S. market. EPA is proposing that the access would have to be granted in response to inspections
or audits that either are announced or unannounced. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA is proposing the inspection and audit access requirement in order to allow EPA inspectors and auditors to confirm
the baseline submissions that would relate to any foreign refinery. In addition, EPA inspections and audits would
confirm the information related to refinery-of-origin that is reported to EPA. The proposed access requirements
related to foreign refineries would provide EPA with access analogous to that exercised over domestic refiners to
conduct inspections and audits. EPA historically has conducted inspections and audits of domestic refineries in
order to ensure compliance with gasoline quality rules, including the lead phasedown requirements at &sect;80.20,
and the gasoline volatility requirements at &sect;&sect;80.27&hyph;28. EPA intends to follow this enforcement
approach with the reformulated gasoline program. EPA believes it is important that it have comparable access to foreign
refinery operations under the proposed approach for foreign refinery baseline in order to meet its enforcement responsibilities.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The scope of the proposed access requirement is intended to allow EPA to inspect or audit wherever documents are located
that would relate to an individual foreign refinery's baseline, or to the production or shipping of gasoline that
would be subject to such a baseline. In addition, the access proposal would ensure EPA access to collect samples of
any gasoline that would be subject to an individual foreign refinery baseline. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA is proposing that the access requirement would terminate on January 1, 2003. This proposed termination date is
five years following January 1, 1998, the last date individual foreign refinery baselines could be used. Five years
is the statutory limitation that applies to potential liability for violations of the reformulated gasoline requirements.
EPA also is proposing that its inspection and audit access would be limited to gasoline produced before 1998 and to
documents that relate to such gasoline. This proposed limitation on the access requirement also corresponds to the
January 1, 1998 date individual foreign refinery baselines would become unavailable.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
EPA would conduct these inspections or audits at facilities controlled by the foreign refiner. As a result, EPA inspectors
and auditors would have to be given access to conduct inspections or audits by the foreign refiner and by the country
in which the foreign refiner's facilities are located. Any failure to grant access, therefore, would be the result
of an action or decision by the foreign refiner or the foreign country. Nevertheless, the consequences of any failure
to give EPA full and immediate access would fall on the U.S. importers of that foreign refiner's gasoline. In consequence,
EPA believes any importer who would claim use of an individual foreign refinery's baseline would be expected to protect
itself against this possibility through whatever means it would feel prudent, such as assurances from the foreign
refiner that the access requirement would be met, or contractual indemnification provisions that would apply in
the event the access requirement is not met. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed consequences for the importer that would result from any failure to meet the access requirements are
discussed below.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
E. Failure To Meet Requirements 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
EPA is proposing that a foreign refinery's individual baseline could not be used by any importer if EPA were to determine
that information submitted to EPA to establish the foreign refinery's individual baseline is inaccurate, or if EPA
were denied access to the foreign refinery to conduct an inspection or audit. EPA also is proposing that a foreign refinery's
individual baseline could not be used by the importer of a specific batch of gasoline in the event any of the foreign
refinery baseline requirements would not be met with respect to that batch of gasoline. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Thus, for example, if EPA would determine that a foreign refinery's individual baseline submittal is in error, an
individual baseline for that refinery could not be used by any importer during any year, unless the Administrator
determines a shorter period is appropriate. Similarly, if EPA were to attempt to conduct an inspection or audit of
a foreign refinery and were to be denied full and immediate access, the individual baseline for that refinery could
not be used by any importer during any year, unless the Administrator determines a shorter period is appropriate.
In this situation, any importer who had previously submitted reports to EPA for any averaging period that included
use of the foreign refinery's individual baseline would be required to recompute its compliance calculations, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
ab initio
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, using the baseline that would apply to the importer in the absence of the foreign refinery's individual baseline_normally
the statutory baseline. This recalculation by the importer would be required even if the recalculation would result
in violations by the importer of the reformulated gasoline standards. It would be no defense for the importer to argue
it used the foreign refinery's individual baseline in a good faith belief the baseline information was accurate,
or that the foreign refiner would allow EPA to conduct inspections and audits. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A similar result would occur if EPA were to discover that a particular batch of imported gasoline, claimed by the importer
to be subject to a foreign refinery's individual baseline, in fact is not entitled to use of that baseline. This could
occur, for example, if through the CPA attest engagement or through an EPA audit it were discovered that the gasoline
comprising the batch was not produced at the foreign refinery claimed by the importer. Another example of gasoline
that would not be entitled to use of a foreign refinery's baseline would be a batch of gasoline that is imported subsequent
to the date when the total volume of imported gasoline for which use of the foreign refinery's baseline is claimed equals
the baseline volume for that foreign refinery. In these cases the importer who improperly claimed use of the foreign
refinery's individual baseline, but not other importers of gasoline produced by that foreign refinery, would be
required to recompute its compliance calculations, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
ab initio
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, as described above. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA is proposing that these consequences would be imposed on the importers, because there are clear barriers to effective
enforcement directly against foreign refiners. This would occur even in a case where EPA could prove that gasoline
was improperly imported using a foreign refinery's individual baseline, and where the improper use was the fault
of the foreign refiner, for example by submitting false baseline information or by refusing to allow EPA inspections
or audits. In such a case EPA could not bring effective enforcement against the foreign refiner. As a result, in order
to preserve the integrity of the reformulated gasoline program, EPA proposes that importers would be ultimately
responsible for the proper establishment and use of individual foreign refinery baselines.

EPA believes that importers would be able to decide whether and when to claim use of a foreign refinery's individual
baseline. This approach is predicated on the assumption that importers would be expected to use great care in making
this decision, and would do so only if the importer has complete confidence the foreign refinery baseline information
was properly submitted to EPA and the foreign refiner intends to fully and properly comply with all requirements related
to use of individual foreign refinery baselines, including requirements that apply years into the future. EPA also
would expect importers to require the foreign refiner to carry out a gasoline volume tracking scheme that would enable
importers to know with certainty that any batch of imported gasoline for which use of the foreign refinery's individual
baseline would be claimed is within the foreign refinery's baseline volume.

III. Justification for Proposed Amendment to Final Rule 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
When EPA issued the final rule on December 15, 1993 the Agency was not fully satisfied that the baseline-setting scheme
applicable to importers, and thereby applicable to foreign refiners, was the optimum solution. In preparing the
final rule, EPA focused on three major issues regarding the use of individual baselines for foreign refiners in the
reformulated and conventional gasoline programs. EPA's overriding consideration, and the basis for EPA's focus
on these issues, was the ultimate environmental consequences of the baseline-setting scheme. The three issues are:
(1) The technical problems with using baseline-setting Methods 2 and 3 to accurately predict the qualities of gasoline
imported in 1990 from a foreign refiner; (2) the ability of the agency to adequately verify and enforce the use of foreign
refiner individual baselines, including problems identifying the refinery of origin of imported gasoline and enforcing
performance standards against a foreign refiner; and (3) any risk that would result from providing refiners or importers
with options in establishing baselines. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The final regulations for reformulated and conventional gasoline, promulgated on December 15, 1993 pursuant to
a court ordered deadline, attempt to resolve these issues. These issues, however, are complex and have potentially
broad consequences. EPA therefore announced that it would continue to consider individual baselines for foreign
refiners after promulgation of the Final Rules in mid-December 1993. This consideration has resulted in today's
proposal, with EPA inviting comments on the proposed resolution described above. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The first issue involved whether and when it would be appropriate to allow refiners or importers an option in establishing
individual baselines. In general, EPA's Final Rule takes the approach that options should not be allowed. Given a
choice, a refiner or importer would tend to choose the option requiring the least expense overall, which would also
presumably be the least protective of the environment. Avoiding options should therefore tend to avoid skewing the
program in a way that would reduce air quality benefits. EPA described this gaming concern in the preamble to the Final
Rule, at 59 FR 7785 (February 16, 1994). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under EPA's Final Rule, domestic refiners are basically provided no choice regarding individual baselines_they
must develop an individual baseline, using one or more of three different methods or modelling approaches. Since
gasoline produced by domestic refiners made up an overwhelming majority of the gasoline sold in the U.S. in 1990, the
average of all domestic refiner baselines should closely approximate the average 1990 quality of gasoline sold in
1990. Importers are treated like domestic refiners in that they are not provided an option on how to develop an individual
baseline. A major difference, however, is that importers may use only the first of the three modeling methods. If the
data are not available for this method, the importer defaults to the statutory baseline. In general, EPA expects all
or almost all importers to default to the statutory baseline.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
For foreign refiners, EPA considered whether it should also require that all foreign refiners establish individual
baselines before they could import either conventional or simple model reformulated gasoline into the U.S. However,
as discussed later, EPA had considerable doubt about the ability of baseline-setting Methods 2 and 3 to accurately
predict the quality of that portion of a foreign refiner's production sent to the U.S. in 1990. EPA believed many foreign
refiners would therefore not be able to use these models, and mandating use of an individual baseline might therefore
lead to a ban on importation of gasoline from those foreign refiners not able to develop such baselines.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
6
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 In addition, EPA had serious questions whether it could adequately verify the accuracy of individual baselines for
foreign refiners under such a scenario. The current Final Rule resolves these concerns by not allowing foreign refiners
to establish individual baselines, and regulating the introduction of gasoline into the U.S. through the importer.
Importers must establish an individual baseline in the manner described above.

EPA considered the option of banning foreign supplies of gasoline that were not produced under a verifiably accurate
individual baseline. This option appeared to redress the issue of the loss of a ``netting out'' effect due to the presumed
loss of ``cleaner'' than statutory baseline foreign gasoline. However, EPA believes that many foreign refiners
do not possess adequate data to establish an individual baseline. It has been agreed that the consequence of banning
foreign supplies of gasoline, both to the nation's energy security and to competitive pricing, would be unfair.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The air quality impact of allowing foreign refiners a choice in what baseline to use, such as would result from the petition
process proposed today, depends in large part on which foreign refiners ultimately would have the ability, and would
choose, to produce reformulated gasoline for importation into the U.S., and on the individual baselines of those
foreign refiners who would make this choice. If a significant number of foreign refiners sent gasoline to the U.S.
in 1990 that was cleaner than the statutory baseline, those refiners would not be expected to choose to establish an
individual baseline but would instead default to the statutory baseline. Refiners who sent gasoline to the U.S. in
1990 that was dirtier than the statutory baseline might well decide to petition for an individual baseline, assuming
they could satisfy all of the conditions for establishing an individual baseline. In such a case, this might result
in certain foreign refiners being allowed to degrade the emissions performance of their gasoline down from its actual
1990 quality to the statutory baseline. Under this approach other foreign refiners might be allowed to establish
accurate and verifiable individual baselines that are dirtier than the statutory baseline, and thereby continue
to produce at this quality. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In comparison, the current regulatory provisions provide foreign refiners with no choice. As described above, foreign
refiners whose 1990 gasoline was cleaner than the statutory baseline may degrade the quality of their gasoline down
to the statutory baseline, while foreign refiners whose 1990 gasoline was dirtier than the statutory baseline are
required to reformulate to meet the stricter statutory baseline. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
It is important to note that EPA does not have any clear evidence as to the actual average quality of gasoline imported
into the U.S. in 1990. EPA does not know, for example, whether a significant amount of such gasoline was cleaner than
the statutory baseline. While it would be reasonable to assume that at least some imported gasoline was cleaner and
some was dirtier than the statutory baseline, EPA is not in a position to quantify this in any reliable manner. As such,
it is not clear whether or how much providing foreign refiners with an option in establishing an individual baseline
would actually skew the air quality impacts of these programs in a negative direction. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As mentioned above, a second major issue EPA has considered involves the technical limits of Methods 1, 2 or 3 in predicting
the qualities of that portion of a foreign refiner's 1990 gasoline production that was sent to the U.S.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

 Foreign refiners likely did not send the majority of their gasoline to the United States in 1990. Foreign refiners
may not have exported the majority of their gasoline to the United States in 1990. Domestic refiners, on the other hand,
are assumed to have distributed (and to continue to distribute) the majority of their gasoline within the U.S. In the
absence of actual 1990 data, domestic refiners may calculate individual baselines using models developed by EPA
that depend, in part, on the fact that the majority of the modelled gasoline is distributed in the U.S. However, foreign
refiners typically did not distribute the majority of their 1990 gasoline within the U.S., rendering the models inappropriate
for those refiners.

These technical limits have important implications for the first issue discussed above. For example, if EPA required
that foreign refiners establish individual baselines, without providing any choice on defaulting to the statutory
baseline, then many foreign refiners might not be able to develop such baselines and EPA would confront a situation
involving whether or not it should ban the importation of gasoline from such foreign refiners.

EPA believes it is possible that in certain limited situations a foreign refiner may be able to establish a baseline
of U.S.-market gasoline quality and quantity. For example, a foreign refiner potentially could establish that in
1990 its refinery produced only a limited number of gasoline blending components, and therefore could be capable
of producing only a predictable and limited number of gasoline types from these blending components. In such a case,
it is possible that a baseline could be established based on the ``cleanest'' of the gasoline types, without actually
showing that this was the gasoline supplied to the U.S. market. Under this approach, the foreign refiner's baseline
would be the most rigorous baseline possible given the refinery configuration.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The third major issue of concern involves whether EPA can accurately verify individual baselines of foreign refiners
and effectively enforce standards for foreign produced gasoline based on such individual baselines. EPA was concerned
that it would not be able to effectively exercise authority to inspect foreign facilities and require the production
of records or samples, or to require accurate auditing of the compliance of foreign operations. This includes, for
example, EPA's ability to ensure the accuracy of an individual foreign refiner baseline, EPA's ability to clearly
identify the refinery of origin for gasoline imported into the U.S. (the ``tracking'' issue), and EPA's ability to
easily access foreign records, samples, and facilities for inspections and other compliance measures. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
With respect to tracking refinery of origin, EPA believes it must be able to establish with certainty which baseline
attaches to each specific batch of gasoline imported into the U.S. The distribution of foreign produced gasoline
is significantly distinct from domestic distribution patterns. As described in the preamble to the final rule, see
59 FR 7785 (February 16, 1994), the association of a refinery-specific baseline with the gasoline produced at a domestic
refinery is relatively uncomplicated, because compliance is determined at the refinery level before fungible mixing
in the gasoline distribution system. The source refinery for gasoline is clear before the gasoline leaves the refinery.
In the case of all imported gasoline, on the other hand, the gasoline will be transported from the refinery to the U.S.
port of entry prior to the point at which the imported gasoline would have to be associated with a foreign refinery-specific
baseline. This stage of transportation from the foreign refinery to the U.S. port of entry could be by fungible means
for any imported gasoline, with the consequence that fungible mixing could obscure the identity of the source refinery
for any batch of imported gasoline. For a discussion of these and other enforcement and compliance related issues,
see the preamble to the final rule at 59 FR 7787 (February 16, 1994). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Finally, it is important to place the role of individual baselines in their proper context for the reformulated and
conventional gasoline programs. For conventional gasoline, the individual baseline of a refiner or importer establishes
the applicable emissions standard for the conventional gasoline they produce or import. On average, a refiner's
or importer's conventional gasoline has to meet an emissions performance standard measured by the performance of
their individual baseline. If the refiner or importer is assigned the statutory baseline instead of an individual
baseline, then performance is measured against the statutory baseline. This performance standard applies on an
annual basis starting with 1995. The statutory basis for these requirements are found in section 211(k)(8) of the
Act. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The individual baseline plays a much more limited rule in the reformulated gasoline program. For the first three years
of that program, three specific fuel qualities are capped at the level of a refiner's or importer's individual baseline.
<FOOTCITE>9</FOOTCITE>
 Starting January 1, 1998, a refiner or importer's individual baseline has no relevance in the reformulated gasoline
program. This short term requirement is part of the standards adopted by EPA and commonly called the simple model.
The refiner and importer specific caps on the three parameters were based on EPA's understanding of the directional
impacts of these parameters on emissions, the lack of adequate data to fully model the emissions impacts of these three
gasoline parameters when EPA proposed the simple model, and the lead time needed before requiring use of a subsequent,
more complex emissions performance model adopted by EPA in the final rule. Further discussion of this may be found
in the preamble to the final rule at 59 FR 7720 (February 16, 1994).

The final rule's requirements for individual baselines resolves these various concerns in a straightforward manner.
EPA is seeking comment on whether this proposal addresses all of the above concern, in a manner that achieves the environmental
goals intended for reformulated gasoline while at the same time addressing the equity concerns that previously have
been raised, by placing clear limits and conditions on the use of individual baselines for foreign refiners. These
limits and conditions would be designed to address the issues described above_concerns about skewing of air quality
benefits in a negative direction by providing options in establishing individual baselines, concerns about the
technical limits of the refinery modeling used to establish baselines, and finally concerns over the Agency's ability
to adequately verify individual baselines for foreign refiners and adequately ensure compliance by imported gasoline
with standards based on individual baselines.

A. Accuracy of Individual Foreign Refiner Baselines 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As described in detail above, this proposed amendment provides that parties that desire to establish an individual
baseline for a foreign refinery would submit a petition to EPA's Assistant Administrator for Air and Radiation to
establish a reliable and verifiable individual baseline. The petitioner would also submit data adequate to establish
the volume of gasoline exported to the United States during 1990. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Assistant Administrator would only approve petitions when the individual baseline had been established with
sufficient certainty, to the satisfaction of the Assistant Administrator. The Assistant Administrator's decision
whether to approve a petition would depend, in part, on the certainty with which the foreign refiner's 1990 fuel properties
and volume data could be verified by a U.S.-based independent baseline auditor and by EPA, as discussed above. In requiring
that a petitioner bear the burden of demonstrating to the Assistant Administrator that the individual baseline and
the data submitted in support of an individual baseline is accurate and verifiable, and in requiring that a U.S.-based
attestor corroborate that demonstration, the amendment provides for appropriate certainty in establishing accurate
individual baselines. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA requests comment as to whether the proposal would result in appropriate certainty as to any foreign refinery baseline
that would be established. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
B. Certainty as to Refinery-of-Origin 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In the preamble to the final rule, EPA expressed concern about effectively determining the refinery-of-origin for
specific batches of imported gasoline so as to determine the appropriate baseline to be applied to the product. However,
EPA is proposing and seeking comment on procedures that are designed to ensure that importers effectively track gasoline
from the point of gasoline production to the port-of-entry into the U.S. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Strict tracking and segregation of reformulated gasoline that is produced by foreign refiners and that would be subject
to an individual baseline is necessary to assure compliance with this program. Only by matching a discrete volume
of gasoline with an individual baseline would an importer be able to accurately calculate its compliance with this
proposed amendment to the reformulated gasoline program. Further, such tracking and segregation is necessary for
EPA to ensure that use of an individual baseline remains within the foreign refiner's volume cap. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Today's proposed amendment of the final rule seeks to provide for certainty with respect to establishing the refinery-of-origin
of imported gasoline through the use of independent sampling and testing that would be required upon loading on-board
ship at the refinery-of-origin and upon receipt by an importer at a U.S. port-of-entry. The sampling and testing at
both ends of the shipment would help to assure that the volume and parameters of the product subject to the individual
baseline are identical. Additionally, the independent laboratory would verify the foreign refinery-of-origin
before the shipment leaves the foreign port. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The amendment proposes that batch specific information pertaining to the parameters and volume of the batch would
be collected by an independent laboratory upon loading of the product and a report filed with EPA. This information
would be available for comparison with batch specific information required to be collected by importers upon receipt
of product. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Further, the tracking system would help to ensure that EPA could determine that the imported reformulated gasoline
produced subject to an individual baseline was not commingled with gasoline produced under another baseline en route
from its source to the U.S. port-of-entry. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Today's proposal also would require that an importer exercising the option to use a foreign refinery's individual
baseline must demonstrate that an annual attestation engagement is conducted of the foreign refinery for each year
of individual baseline use. The engagement would be undertaken by a U.S.-based CPA or firm. This requirement would
be equivalent with attest engagement requirements applicable to domestic refiners and importers under the Final
Rule. The engagement would verify that the gasoline loaded on-board ship was produced by the refinery for which individual
baseline use is claimed. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The practical effect of today's proposal would be to condition the use of individual foreign refinery baselines upon
strict tracking of reformulated gasoline. An importer's use of a foreign refinery's individual baseline would depend
upon the importer's ability to establish with certainty that the reformulated gasoline for which the individual
baseline is claimed was, in fact, produced at the foreign refinery for which the individual baseline is applicable.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA requests comment regarding whether there would be appropriate certainty as to the refinery of origin of any imported
gasoline that would use an individual foreign refinery's baseline under this proposal.

C. The Limited Potential for Adverse Air Quality Effects From Gaming 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
It has been argued that the proposed constraints on the use of individual baselines by importers would limit the potential
for gaming associated with establishing baselines for imported gasoline, and in consequence the potential for adverse
air quality effects from such gaming.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
If all foreign refiners sending gasoline to the U.S. established accurate and verifiable baselines, and concerns
about tracking refinery of origin and other compliance concerns were resolved, then it has been agreed, those baselines
and the gasoline produced under them clearly and easily would lead to the air quality benefits expected from conventional
and reformulated gasoline. This might be considered the ``ideal'', or best possible result. As described earlier,
however, there is considerable doubt about whether accurate, verifiable, and enforceable baselines can be expected
for 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
all
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 foreign refiners. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Final Rule addresses these problems in effect by requiring all foreign refiners to produce gasoline using the
statutory baseline_those cleaner than the statutory baseline are allowed to degrade down to that baseline, while
those dirtier than the statutory baselines are required to clean up to that baseline. While the Final Rule would not
allow the average quality of foreign produced gasoline to degrade below the statutory baseline, it might in fact require
that foreign gasoline be cleaner on average than would be required if all refiners did establish individual baselines.

This would occur if the average quality of all gasoline imports in 1990 was dirtier than the statutory baseline. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
</FOOTNOTE>

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
One concern regarding the approach used in the Final Rule is that it treats all foreign refiners as a class (by assigning
the statutory baseline to all imported gasoline), yet the factors that led to grouping foreign refiners as a class
may not apply equally to all foreign refiners. The result of the class approach to resolving the foreign refiner baseline
issue could be considered unfair to any particular foreign refiner who would be able to accurately establish refinery
baselines, and who would be able to establish with certainty the refinery of origin for gasoline imported into the
United States. On the other hand, and as has been discussed above, allowing each foreign refiner to choose whether
to establish individual refinery baselines creates the potential for gaming with consequent adverse environmental
effects. The challenge for EPA, then, is to create a regulatory mechanism for imported gasoline baselines that is
as fair as possible to each foreign refiner, but that also achieves the environmental goals intended for reformulated
gasoline. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed revisions would allow certain foreign refiners the option to petition for the right to establish individual
baselines under carefully controlled circumstances. As discussed above, this proposed scheme has a potential for
adverse air quality effects, in comparison to the current Final Rule, because some importers would have an option
as to which baseline would apply to imported reformulated gasoline. Presumably, foreign refiners and their U.S.
importer business partners would elect to seek to establish individual foreign refinery baselines only if the foreign
refinery produced gasoline in 1990 that was ``dirtier'' than the statutory baseline alternative to an individual
foreign refinery baseline. In the case of foreign refineries that produced gasoline in 1990 that was ``cleaner''
than the statutory baseline, on the other hand, the foreign refiners and their U.S. importer business partners presumably
would use the less stringent and less costly statutory baseline option. EPA's ``gaming'' concern would result from
these likely decisions by ``dirtier'' and ``cleaner'' foreign refiners. The potential adverse air quality consequence
would result from the volume of imported gasoline during 1995 through 1997 that would use a ``dirtier''-than-statutory
baseline, and the loss to the U.S. gasoline pool during 1995 through 1997 of gasoline produced to meet a ``cleaner''-than-statutory
baselines. There may or may not be an adverse air quality impact in relation to the ``ideal'' scenario described above,
depending on whether the average quality of gasoline imported from foreign refiners in 1990 was different from the
statutory baseline and how much reformulated gasoline is imported in 1995 through 1997.

EPA has been unable to identify any foreign refiners other than PDVSA who intend to produce any reformulated gasoline,

11
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 though there nevertheless could be some because there is no requirement that refiners must announce their intentions
at this time. The absence of identified foreign reformulated gasoline refiners (other than PDVSA) does present the
possibility that there will be few, if any, foreign reformulated gasoline refiners who would have a ``cleaner''-than
statutory baseline (but who would opt for the statutory baseline). If true, this would resolve EPA's gaming concern.

EPA does expect some imports of reformulated gasoline under the Final Rule's provision that applies to a foreign refinery
that is owned by the U.S. importer and where at least 75% of the refinery's 1990 production was imported into the U.S.
These refineries are relevant to this discussion. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
</FOOTNOTE>

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Moreover, even to the extent there are foreign refiners who would qualify for ``cleaner''-than-statutory baselines
EPA believes there is a possibility that their gasoline would nevertheless be cleaner than the statutory baseline,
which would limit the likelihood for adverse air quality effects. This possibility was presented to EPA by a foreign
refiner who argued that such ``clean'' refiners may in fact be technologically incapable of relaxing production
parameters so as to realize a benefit from the statutory baseline. To the extent this may be true, such ``clean'' refiners
might reduce any adverse air quality impact associated with providing an option to establish individual baselines.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The principal reason limiting the potential for adverse air quality effects from gaming under today's proposal is,
however, that use of ``dirtier''-than-statutory individual baselines would be restricted. It has been argued that
this would in turn limit any adverse air quality effects, in relation to the current final rule.

 At the same time, any reformulated gasoline imported under an individual baseline would be required to meet the same
standards that apply to any other refiner, foreign or domestic, with the same baseline. For the three parameters of
interest under the simple model for reformulated gasoline, sulfur, olefins, and T&hyph;90, reformulated gasoline
produced by a foreign or domestic refiner with an individual baseline would have to meet an annual average limit set
at 100% of the individual baseline level for those parameters. This effectively requires that the gasoline stay as
clean as it was in 1990, for those three specific parameters.

It is important to note that the potential for adverse air quality effects discussed in this preamble is in relation
to gasoline that would be imported under the approach contained in the Final Rule, i.e., to imported gasoline that
meets the statutory baseline. That comparison may not be fair. Another comparison that may be more appropriate would
be with imported gasoline that is produced to each foreign refinery's individual baseline, like is done for domestic
refiners. When imported gasoline is compared based on individual foreign refinery baselines, there may be no potential
for adverse air quality effects from today's proposal.

EPA has considered the level of emissions that would result from gasoline imported under the approach contained in
the final rule, versus gasoline imported under the approach described in today's proposal. While no baselines have
been established yet for any refiner or importer, PDVSA has submitted to the reformulated gasoline docket a record
that describes the baseline it would be able to establish if given the opportunity. The baseline it describes is dirtier
than the statutory baseline for some parameters, and cleaner for other parameters. In the case of sulfur and olefins,
PDVSA's stated baseline levels would be significantly higher than the statutory baseline: PDVSA's claimed sulfur
level is 644 parts per million (ppm), and the statutory baseline level is 339 ppm; PDVSA's claimed olefin level is 22
vol% and the statutory baseline level is 9.2 vol%. The environmental implication is that NO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

Taking into account the volume of PDVSA's gasoline that is used in the Northeast U.S._its primary market, EPA's preliminary

1. The Volume Limitation on Use of Individual Refinery Baselines 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
An importer's use of a foreign refinery's individual baseline is proposed to be limited to volumes of reformulated
gasoline equivalent to the foreign refinery's 1990 volume of gasoline imports to the U.S. This volume constraint
is described above. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The volume cap limiting use of an individual baseline for reformulated gasoline production (until January 1, 1998)
to a foreign refiner's 1990 import volumes ensures that the use of an individual baseline is constrained by historical
import volumes. Volumes imported above the 1990 constraint would be subject to the importer's statutory baseline.
Foreign-produced reformulated gasoline subject to an individual baseline, within the 1990 volume cap limitation,
would be measured for compliance against gasoline produced in 1990, and therefore would be at least as clean as the
foreign refiner's 1990 gasoline. However, any reformulated gasoline produced by a foreign refiner above the 1990
volume would be evaluated relative to the statutory baseline and therefore would be at least as clean as reformulated
gasoline produced using the statutory baseline. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
2. The Time Limitation on the Use of Individual Foreign Refinery Baselines 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A further constraint on potential adverse air quality effects is the time limit on an importer's use of a foreign refiner's
individual baseline. It would be limited to the period commencing when reformulated gasoline is first imported into
the U.S. and continues through December 31, 1997. After 1997, individual baselines have no further relevance to the
requirements for reformulated gasoline, and all importers and domestic refiners are required by the Final Rule to
measure compliance with the reformulated gasoline standards against the statutory baseline. Therefore, the effect
of this regulation would be limited to this three year period only. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
3. The Number of Foreign Refiners Who Would Seek to Use Individual Foreign Refinery Baselines Would be Limited
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This proposal is predicated on the assumption that the costs inherent in producing reformulated gasoline and meeting
the requirements of the reformulated gasoline program, including those costs necessary to establish an individual
baseline, will deter most foreign refiners from selecting the individual baseline option, thereby further limiting
any potential adverse air quality impact. These costs include extensive refinery modifications; costs associated
with petitioning EPA for an individual baseline and providing adequate information to establish with certainty
that the baseline determination is accurate; a baseline audit; and the record keeping and product tracking associated
with complying with the proposed annual compliance audits. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA believes that few refiners have made the requisite capital investments necessary to produce reformulated gasoline.
Therefore, it currently appears that the number of foreign refiners who would take advantage of this proposed amendment
would be limited. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition, the limited time period during which individual foreign refinery baselines could be used may limit the
number of foreign refiners that would take advantage of this option, because the costs associated with exercising
this option described above, could only be recouped within the 1995 through 1997 time frame. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
4. Conventional Gasoline Not Affected by This Proposed Amendment 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
EPA's concern for gaming in the case of conventional gasoline is substantially greater than its concern with respect
to reformulated gasoline. First, there is likely to be significantly more conventional gasoline imported into the
U.S. than reformulated gasoline. Second, the Final Rule provides that individual baseline will be the basis for conventional
gasoline compliance into the foreseeable future while an individual baseline for reformulated gasoline is applicable
only until December 31, 1997. Accordingly, due to these volumetric and long term distinctions between reformulated
gasolines and conventional gasolines, the potential for adverse air quality impact is significantly larger if individual
foreign refinery baselines could be used with conventional gasoline, as compared with the potential if individual
foreign refinery baselines could be used with reformulated gasoline. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Final Rule requires that domestic refiners apply their individual baselines to conventional gasoline production.
EPA anticipates that nationwide use of individual baselines will result in gasoline quality that approximately
equals the statutory baseline. However, EPA believes that an option to use individual baselines by foreign refiners
in the production of conventional gasoline would result in significant skewing, in a negative direction, of the average
quality of imported gasoline based on the gaming scenario described above.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A skewing in a negative direction of the average of baselines with respect to foreign conventional gasoline, is of
significant concern because EPA anticipates that most foreign sources of gasoline will provide conventional gasoline
to the U.S. This assumption is based on EPA's belief that few foreign producers of gasoline have invested in the capital
equipment necessary for complying with the reformulated gasoline program. Further, the increased costs of capitalization
realized by a refiner entering the reformulated gasoline market would be exacerbated by the continuing costs of overseas
shipping under the segregated fuels requirement proposed in this amendment. Accordingly, there appears to be few
economic incentives for foreign refiners to reallocate production from conventional to reformulated gasolines.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Thus, EPA is not proposing to change the approach contained in the Final Rule pertaining to baselines for imported
conventional gasoline, and EPA expects all or almost all importers to default to the statutory baseline.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA requests comment as to the magnitude of any potential adverse air quality consequences that would result from
gaming under today's proposal. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
D. EPA's Compliance Oversight Authority
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The preamble to the Final Rule expresses EPA's concern that it would lack adequate compliance monitoring and enforcement
techniques to ensure that foreign refineries comply fully with the reformulated gasoline program. This concern
arose out of the perceived need to bring any enforcement actions against importers that would rely on baseline audits
and inspections of foreign refiners, and that these foreign refiners may not be subject to the full panoply of enforcement
mechanisms available with domestic corporations.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Today's proposed amendment, however, provides for compliance monitoring and enforcement pertaining to foreign-produced
reformulated gasoline to focus on domestic importers. Such foreign-produced reformulated gasoline would be subject
to the full array of monitoring and enforcement devices available to EPA. It has been argued that importers' potential
liability, including but not limited to exposure to potential relegation to compliance with the statutory baseline,
will be adequate to ensure that importers would import gasoline using an individual foreign refinery's baseline
only where the importer has sufficient confidence the requirements of this program would be met, including the compliance
monitoring provisions that require the cooperation of the foreign refiner and the government of the country in which
the foreign refiner is located. These compliance monitoring and enforcement provisions appears to be equivalent
to EPA's compliance monitoring and enforcement authority over domestic refiners.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposal provides that, as a condition for the use of a foreign refinery's individual baseline, EPA would be guaranteed
full and immediate access to conduct compliance oversight inspections, collect gasoline samples and perform compliance
audits at the foreign refinery. EPA's compliance audits supplement the baseline certification and annual audits
specified elsewhere in this proposal. EPA's compliance oversight authority is proposed to last until January 1,
2003, consistent with the statute of limitations governing violations of the reformulated gasoline program and
associated statutes governing the submission of information to the U.S. government.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition, foreign refiners electing to petition to use an individual baseline would be required to engage a domestic
CPA to conduct a baseline certification audit and annual attest engagements. EPA anticipates that and is seeking
comment on whether the professional standards governing the conduct of such audits, as well as the amenability of
a U.S. CPA to EPA compliance monitoring and enforcement, is adequate assurance that EPA can effectively monitor foreign
refiners for program compliance.

E. EPA Seeks Comment on Today's Proposal, or Any Alternative Approaches 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Today's proposal is an attempt to resolve the issue of baselines for foreign refiners in a more appropriate manner,
with the intent of achieving several important, but different, goals. One goal is that the environmental benefits
intended for reformulated gasoline by the Clean Air Act be realized. The other goal is that all regulated parties who
are similarly situated be treated alike, with the differences in treatment between domestic and foreign refiners
limited to those measures necessary to appropriately accommodate differences in their situations and protect human
health and environmental values. EPA recognizes that there may be other methods for regulating imported reformulated
gasoline that resolve these two goals in ways that are preferable to the approaches contained both in the Final Rule
and in today's proposal. EPA requests comment as to any alternative approaches to regulating imported reformulated
gasoline that achieves the environmental benefits required by the Clean Air Act for reformulated gasoline, and that
treats domestic and foreign refiners in a manner consistent with the provisions of the GATT.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Under Executive Order 12866, (58 FR 51735 (October 4, 1993)) the Agency must determine whether the regulatory action
is ``significant'' and therefore subject to OMB review and the requirements of the Executive Order. The Order defines
``significant regulatory action'' as one that is likely to result in a rule that may:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Have an annual effect on the economy of $100 million or more or adversely affect in a material way the economy, a sector
of the economy, productivity, competition, jobs, the environment, public health or safety, or State, local, or tribal
governments or communities;

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(2) Create a serious inconsistency or otherwise interfere with an action taken or planned by another agency; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Materially alter the budgetary impact of entitlement, grants, user fees, or loan programs or the rights and obligations

(4) Raise novel legal or policy issues arising out of legal mandates, the President's priorities, or the principles
set forth in the Executive Order. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Pursuant to the terms of Executive Order 12866, it has been determined that this rule is a ``significant regulatory
action'' because of the potential impacts on portions of the domestic refining and gasoline importing industry.
As such, this action was submitted to OMB for review. Changes made in response to OMB suggestions or recommendations
will be documented in the public record.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Pursuant to section 605(b) of the Regulatory Flexibility Act (RFA), 5 U.S.C. 605(b), the Administrator certifies
that this rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The issue of baselines for imported reformulated gasoline is discussed generally in section VII-C of the Regulatory
Impact Analysis that was prepared to support the Final Rule for reformulated gasoline. A copy of this document may
be found in the reformulated gasoline docket, number A&hyph;92&hyph;12, at the location identified in the

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
section of this document. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The RFA of 1980 requires federal agencies to examine the effects of proposed regulations and to identify significant
adverse impacts on a substantial number of small entities. Because the RFA does not provide concrete definitions
of ``small entity,'' ``significant impact,'' or ``substantial number,'' EPA has established guidelines setting
the standards to be used in evaluating impacts on small businesses.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 For purposes of the proposed individual foreign refinery requirements for reformulated gasoline, a small entity
is any business which is independently owned and operated and not dominant in its field as defined by SBA regulations
under section 3 of the Small Business Act.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Agency believes that the individual foreign refinery baseline requirements being proposed today are unlikely
to have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. The businesses affected will be either
a relatively small number of major domestic oil companies who would compete with imported gasoline that is produced
at foreign refineries for which individual baselines are established, or importers who would import gasoline that
is produced by foreign refineries for which individual baselines are established. EPA expects the number of foreign
refineries for which individual baselines will be established will be small, with the result that the number of affected
domestic refiners and importers also will be small. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
However, EPA invites comment on the question of significant impacts on small entities. EPA also requests all relevant
data which justify any conclusions submitted.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 If any requirement specified in paragraphs (b) through (f) of this section is not fully met for any calendar year, or
if the Administrator determines that the information submitted to EPA under paragraphs (b) through (f) of this section
is inaccurate in whole or in part, then compliance with the requirements of &sect;&sect;80.41 (h) and (i) by an importer
shall be measured, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
ab initio
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

Volume constraints.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (1) During any calendar year the total volume of gasoline imported by one or more importers to which a foreign refinery's
baseline applies shall not be greater than the refinery's 1990 baseline volume. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Where the volume of gasoline for which the foreign refinery's baseline is claimed by one or more importers during
any calendar year exceeds the refinery's 1990 baseline volume, the refinery's baseline applies only to the first
volume of that refinery's gasoline that is imported into the United States that equals the 1990 baseline volume. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) In the event any importer uses a foreign refinery baseline in violation of the volume constraint specified in paragraphs
(h) (1) through (2) of this section the importer shall, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
ab initio
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, calculate compliance using the baseline values that properly apply under paragraphs (h) (1) through (2) of this
section. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) In the event any gasoline is imported before January 1, 1995 for which a separate foreign refinery baseline is claimed:

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) Such gasoline shall be combined with gasoline imported during 1995 for which the separate foreign refinery baseline
is claimed for purposes of the volume constraint specified in paragraphs (h) (1) through (2) of this section; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) An adjusted 1990 baseline volume for the foreign refinery shall be calculated, for use during the combined 1994
and 1995 period only, by multiplying the 1990 baseline volume for the foreign refinery times 1.17.

The Federal Communications Commission will hold an 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
en banc
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 hearing on children's television on Tuesday, June 28, 1994. The hearing will convene at 9 a.m. in Room 856, at 1919 M
Street, NW., Washington, DC, and will be open to the public. The Commission has determined that it would be useful to
hear oral presentations and a direct exchange of viewpoints on the issues raised in the pending children's television
proceeding. The issues in this proceeding focus on the Commission's current definition of informational and educational
programming and the amount of informational and educational programming a broadcaster must air to meet its obligation
to children under the Children's Television Act. The Commission had earlier issued a Notice of Inquiry, 8 FCC Rcd 1841
(1993) (58 FR 14367, March 17, 1993), in this proceeding, comments were filed on May 7, 1993, and reply comment were
filed on June 7, 1993.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Parties wishing to make oral presentations and appear on panels to debate issues at this hearing should submit written
requests by close-of-business, Wednesday, May 11, 1994, to: Larry A. Miller, Video Services Division, Mass Media
Bureau, Federal Communications Commission, 1919 M Street, NW._room 702, Washington, DC 20554.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Such requests should clearly identify the speaker, the organization represented (if any), relevant experience
and training, and the specific topic(s) to be discussed. Appropriate topics include any issues related to the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
NOI
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, and specifically comments on changes in the availability, quantity, quality and effectiveness of programming
directed to the educational and informational needs of children, including standard-length programming, that
have occurred between the enactment of the Children's Television Act of 1990 and the present. The Commission is also
interested in comments on the economics of providing educational and informational programming for children either
to the home or to the classroom.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Depending on the number of requests, it may be necessary to limit the number of presenters. If so, we will select speakers
for the hearing in order to achieve broad representation of different viewpoints. With this in mind, interested parties
wishing to present similar material are encouraged to propose a single representative or consolidated presentation.
The precise format and schedule for the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
en banc
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 hearing, as well as a list of the selected presenters, will be specified in a future public notice; however, we anticipate
that presentations will be limited to no more than five minutes.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Persons selected to appear will be required to submit to the Secretary by close-of-business, Wednesday, June 8, 1994,

Abstract: This action is needed to amend the regulations regarding 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reconstitution of bases, allotments, and quotas in order to 1) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
clarify them, 2) make them more consistent with the payment 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
limitation regulations, and 3) determine whether a spouse should 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
be considered the ``same owner'' when determining whether land is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
under the same ownership. No Federal outlays are expected.

Abstract: This action is needed to allow for the waiver of restrictions on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
program eligibility, as authorized by the Federal Debt Collection 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Procedures Act of 1990 (the Act), and to facilitate the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
collection of judgements by administrative offset. The Act 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
provides that debtors who have judgement liens against their 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
property for a debt owed to the United States are not eligible to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
receive grants or loans made by the United States until the debt 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
is paid in full or otherwise satisfied. However, the Act also 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
permits agencies to waive this restriction. In addition, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Commodity Credit Corporation is authorized to collect debts for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
other Federal agencies by administrative offset upon receipt of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) a qualified offset request, (2) a Notice of Levy, or (3) a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
request or approval by the Department of Justice. This action 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
would authorize ASCS to collect judgements in favor of the United 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
States by administrative offset. This action will result in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
increased collection of debts owed to the Government.

Abstract: The Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1981 required that U.S. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Warehouse Act licensing and examination programs be operated on a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
fee basis. New regulations are required when an increase and/or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
decrease is warranted. Fixed fees were implemented in 1981 and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
were last increased in 1985. The interest accumulating in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Warehouse User Fee Account has been the major reason for not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
having to adjust the fee schedule before now. In more recent 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
years, low interest rates and increased expenses (primarily 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
salaries, travel, and administrative costs), coupled with 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
collections which have not changed significantly over the past 10 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
years, will result in a deficit in the ``fee collection account'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
by FY 1994 if the fee schedule is not revised, and would thus 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
require a reduction in service. The cost of Government of this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
action has not yet been determined.

Abstract: This action is needed to implement the 1994 Wool and Mohair 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Program, as required by legislation. The purpose of the Program 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
is to encourage the continued domestic production of wool at 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
prices fair to both producers and consumers in a manner that will 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
assure a viable domestic wool industry in the future, by 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
supporting the prices of wool and mohair by means of loans, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
purchases, payments, or other operations. The support level for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
wool is set by statutory formula. Payments are to be 75 percent 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of the amount otherwise determined. The other determinations are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to: (1) support mohair at a level not more than 15 percent above 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
or below the comparable percentage of parity at which shorn wool 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
is supported, and (2) support pulled wool through payments based 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
on the liveweight of unshorn lambs marketed for slaughter. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
expected cost is $130&hyph;150 million.

Abstract: This action is necessary to amend the regulations regarding 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
payments to persons convicted of controlled substance violations 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to reflect recent legislation. Current regulations implement the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Food Security Act of 1985 provisions but not the FY 1993 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Appropriations Act provisions. This action will thus amend the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
regulations to implement the statutory provisions regarding 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
controlled substance violations. The primary effect of this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
action will be to make most conservation programs subject to the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
controlled substance violation provisions and result in some 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
people being declared ineligible for benefits. No Government 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
outlays are expected.

Abstract: This action is needed to implement the Options Pilot Program for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
wheat, corn, and soybeans and possibly other program crops, for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the 1994 crop year, as required by legislation. The program: (1) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
May be expanded to include additional States, counties and crops, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in addition to the ones already administering the program. (2) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Will provide means for farmers to buy put options that would 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
provide price assurance equivalent to deficiency payments and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
price support benefits. (3) Provide terms and conditions for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
producers who elect to participate; (4) Provide provisions for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
administering the program, and (5) Provide measures to prevent 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
circumvention of the program, including refunds and penalties. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Only minor administrative and program costs are expected.

Abstract: This action is needed to revise the regulations governing the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Conservation Reserve Program (CRP) to allow the non-emergency 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
haying and grazing of CRP grasslands, under specified conditions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Such haying and grazing can have beneficial impacts on wildlife 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
habitat and cover quality while still achieving the goals of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
CRP. Issues to be considered include conditions for allowing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
haying and grazing, acreage to be allowed, monitoring and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
enforcement, compensation offset, effects on wildlife habitat and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ground cover, and impacts on local markets. A savings to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Government would likely result from the compensation offset, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
while monitoring and enforcement costs would likely increase 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
slightly.

Marketing Quotas 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
Abstract: The flue-cured tobacco marketing quota and price support are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
required by statute. The purpose of quotas and price support is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to balance supply with demand at levels assuring stable supplies 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for domestic and export use at prices that are considered 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
sufficient for producers. The national quota is based on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
cigarette manufacturers' intentions, 3-year average exports, a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
loan stocks adjustment, and discretionary adjustment of plus or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
minus 3 percent. The quota may not be less than 90 percent of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
previous year's quota except this limit may be waived if producer 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
association inventories likely will exceed 150 percent of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reserve stock level. The price support level is based on a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
formula that averages market prices (2/3 weight) and a cost index 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1/3 weight), with discretion to limit any increase to 65 percent 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of the formula increase. Marketing quotas are implemented if 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
approved by producer in a referendum scheduled for January 1995. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Gross loan outlays of $30 million are expected in FY's 1995 and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1996. They will be offset by redemptions and no-net-cost 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
assessments in FY 1996 and later years, for a net cost of 0.

Marketing Quotas.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
Abstract: Marketing quotas and acreage allotments are required by statute 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for these kinds of tobacco: Fire-cured (type 21), Fire-cured 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(types 22-23), Dark Air-cured (types 35-36), Virginia sun-cured 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(type 37), Cigar Filler (type 46) and Cigar Filler and Binder 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(types 42-44 and 53-55). Quotas and allotments are determined by 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
statutory formula to balance supply with demand to assure stable 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
supplies for domestic and export use. Marketing quotas are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
implemented if approved by producers in referenda. Producers 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
approved quotas for the 1995 crops of cigar filler (type 46) and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
cigar filler and binder (types 42-44 and 53-55) in March, 1993. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Referenda for the other kinds are scheduled for March, 1994 and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1995. Producers of these types have historically voted in favor 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of quotas. Price support levels are set by statutory formula. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Secretary may reduce the level at the request of producer 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
associations, and may limit increases to 65 percent of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
formula increase. Gross loan outlays of $2 million are expected 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in FY 1996. They will be offset by loan redemptions and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
no-net-cost assessments in FY 1996 and subsequent years, for a

net cost of 0.

Abstract: Marketing quotas and acreage allotments are required by statute 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to be announced for these three kinds of tobacco: Maryland (type 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
32), cigar filler (type 41) and cigar binder (type 51-52). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Marketing quotas are implemented, if approved by producers in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
referenda, to achieve a supply equal to the ``reserve supply 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
level'' as defined by legislation. No quotas are in effect because 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
producers disapproved quotas for 1992-94 crops, and that status 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
will continue if producers again disapprove quotas for the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1995-97 crops in referenda scheduled for March 1995. Negligible 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
cost to Government is expected.

Abstract: This action is needed to implement the national peanut poundage 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
quota, as required by statute. The purpose of the quota is to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
balance supply with demand at a level that will assure stable 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
supplies for domestic use and assure producers a stable income. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The export-edible sales price for additional peanuts provides 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
price stability for additional peanuts sold under contract and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
assures handlers that CCC will not undercut export efforts. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
primary determinations are: 1) National Poundage Quota--set by 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
statutory formula, based on the Secretary's estimate of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
amount of peanuts required for domestic food, seed, and related 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
uses for the 1995 marketing year. The 1995 marketing year is from 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
August 1, 1995, through July 31, 1996. 2) Minimum CCC 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
export-edible sales price for additional peanuts--established at 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the Secretary's discretion (the level has been set at $400 per 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ton each of the last 7 years). The peanut program as a whole will 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
result in a net realized loss of about $46.5 million, which will 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
be attributable to loan forfeitures.

Abstract: This action is needed to revise the regulations governing the

Wheat, Feed Grain, Cotton, and Rice Programs, as follows: 1) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Implement the 0,50/85 and 0,50/92 provisions of the updates 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993; 2) Amend the ARP participation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
contracts to provide for declarations of intention to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
participate; 3) Amend the Integrated Farm Management provisions 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for 1994; 4) Clarify the compliance regulations; and 5) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Incorporate existing handbook provisions. Implementation of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
0,50/85 and 0,50/92 provisions is expected to save about $95-$100 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
million annually. The other provisions will have insignificant 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
costs.

Abstract: This action is needed to implement the Wheat Program as required 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
by the Food, Agriculture, Conservation, and Trade Act of 1990. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The purpose of the program is to assure sufficient supplies of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
wheat for domestic and export use, maintain adequate carryover 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
stocks, and support farm income. The expected cost is about $1 to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
$3 billion.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 We are advising the public that six environmental assessments and findings of no significant impact have been prepared
by the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service relative to the issuance of permits to allow the field testing of
genetically engineered organisms. The environmental assessments provide a basis for our conclusion that the field
testing of these genetically engineered organisms will not present a risk of introducing or disseminating a plant
pest and will not have a significant impact on the quality of the human environment. Based on its findings of no significant
impact, the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service has determined that environmental impact statements need
not be prepared.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The regulations in 7 CFR part 340 (referred to below as the regulations) regulate the introduction (importation,
interstate movement, and release into the environment) of genetically engineered organisms and products that are
plant pests or that there is reason to believe are plant pests (regulated articles). A permit must be obtained before
a regulated article may be introduced into the United States. The regulations set forth the procedures for obtaining
a limited permit for the importation or interstate movement of a regulated article and for obtaining a permit for the
release into the environment of a regulated article. The Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) has stated
that it would prepare an environmental assessment and, when necessary, an environmental impact statement before
issuing a permit for the release into the environment of a regulated article (see 52 FR 22906). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In the course of reviewing each permit application, APHIS assessed the impact on the environment that releasing the
organisms under the conditions described in the permit application would have. APHIS has issued permits for the field
testing of the organisms listed below after concluding that the organisms will not present a risk of plant pest introduction
or dissemination and will not have a significant impact on the quality of the human environment. The environmental
assessments and findings of no significant impact, which are based on data submitted by the applicants and on a review
of other relevant literature, provide the public with documentation of APHIS' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
review and analysis of the environmental impacts associated with conducting the field tests. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Environmental assessments and findings of no significant impact have been prepared by APHIS relative to the issuance
of permits to allow the field testing of the following genetically engineered organisms:

 (58 FR 63332), FGIS announced that the designations of Memphis and Alaska end on May 31, 1994, and asked persons interested
in providing official services within the specified geographic areas to submit an application for designation.
Applications were due by December 31, 1993. Memphis applied for designation in the entire area currently assigned
to it. There were no applicants for the Alaska geographic area. FGIS requested comments on the applicant for the Memphis
area, and comments on the need for official services in Alaska in the February 1, 1994,

regarding the designation criteria in Section 7(f)(1)(A) of the Act; and according to Section 7(f)(1)(B), determined
that Memphis was able to provide official services in the geographic area for which they applied.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

Effective June 1, 1994, and ending May 31, 1997, Memphis is designated to provide official inspection services in

in Alaska to designate an agency. Alaska's designation ends May 31, 1994. Any person desiring official services in
Alaska after this date should contact the FGIS office in Olympia, Washington at 206&hyph;753&hyph;9072 (Fax: 206&hyph;586&hyph;5257).

On April 20, 1992, legislation was signed (Pub. L. 102&hyph;271) amending the Wild and Scenic Rivers Act of 1968 to
include 85 miles of the Allegheny River as a component of the National Wild and Scenic River System. This act gave a ``recreational''
classification to all three designated sections of the Allegheny River between Kinzua Dam and Emlenton, PA. The Act
directed the Secretary of Agriculture to establish two advisory councils to advise him on the final corridor boundaries
and the management of the designated river segments. Approximately 20 percent of the designated river segments are
bordered by public lands and 80 percent by private lands.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The decision to be made, based on this environmental impact statement is: What management guidelines and final corridor
boundaries will best preserve and protect for present and future generations the outstanding scenic, natural recreational,
scientific, historic and ecological values of the Allegheny River while adequately recognizing private land rights?
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The following preliminary issues derived from public involvement during the initial river study and the more recent
advisory council process, as well as significant issues identified during additional scoping, will be considered
in the environmental analysis: (1) Public vs. Private Interests: There is a concern that with the increasing use of
the river by the public, the possibility of conflicts between private landowners and river users will increase. Landowners
are also concerned about the loss of property rights and increased regulation to protect identified river values.
There is also concern that private land use could change the character of the river corridor. (2) River Development:
There is concern about what will be proposed, how proposed river development will be managed and how river development
will affect municipalities and landowners. There is also concern about how to maintain the river's character and
minimize impacts on riparian landowners while developing the economic potential of the river. (3) Land Acquisition:
There is a concern that acquisition of land by the Forest Service within the river corridor will result in a loss of tax
base for local municipalities.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A range of alternatives will be considered. They will include, as a minimum, the no action alternative that does not
recommend any action to implement the Wild and Scenic River designation beyond that which is needed to meet minimum
requirements and existing laws; and an alternative that recommends maximum protection of designated sections,
including public land purchase and the inforporation of advisory council recommendations. Additional alternatives
may be developed from public comments received during the scoping process. The environmental impact statement will
disclose the direct, indirect and cumulative effects of implementing each alternative.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Forest Service is seeking information, comments, and assistance from Federal, State and local agencies, and
other individuals or organizations who may be interested in or affected by the proposal. Comments previously submitted
during the river study and relevant to the management of the corridor as well as new information submitted will be utilized
in the preparation of the draft environmental impact statement. During April 1994, news releases will be mailed to
local and regional newspapers, radio stations, etc., and letters will be sent to key contacts and interested and affected
publics. Advisory Council meetings will continue to be used as a means to inform the public of the analysis process
and to provide for public participation and involvement. Additional meetings may be held in other locations.

The draft environmental impact statement is expected to be filed with the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)
and to be available for public review by September 1994. At that time, EPA will publish a notice of availability of the
draft environmental impact statement in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The comment period on the draft environmental impact statement will be 45 days from the date the Environmental Protection
Agency publishes the notice of available in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Forest Service believes, at this early stage, it is important to give reviewers notice of several court rulings
related to public participation in the environmental review process. Upon release of the draft environmental impact
statement, projected for September 1994, reviewers must structure their participation in the environmental review
of the proposal so that it is meaningful and alerts an agency to the reviewer's position and contentions.

in this proposal participate by the close of the 45-day comment period so that substantive comments and objections
are made available to the Forest Service at a time when it can meaningfully consider them and respond to them in the final
environmental impact statement.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
To assist the Forest Service in identifying and considering issues and concerns on the proposed action, comments
on the draft environmental impact statement should be as specific as possible. It is also helpful if comments refer
to specific pages or chapters of the draft statement. Comments may also address the adequacy of the draft environmental
impact statement or the merits of the alternatives formulated and discussed in the statement. (Reviewers may wish
to refer to the Council on Environmental Quality Regulations for implementing the procedural provisions of the National
Environmental Policy Act at 40 CFR 1503.3 in addressing these points.)
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
After the comment period ends on the draft environmental impact statement, the comments will be analyzed, and considered
by the Forest Service in preparing the final environmental impact statement. The final environmental impact statement
is scheduled to be completed by December 1994. This decision will be subject to appeal under 36 CFR 217.3.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Access Board established a Recreation Access Advisory Committee to provide advice on issues related to making
recreational facilities and outdoor developed areas readily accessible to and usable by individuals with disabilities.
This advice will be used by the Access Board to develop accessibility guidelines under the Americans with Disabilities
Act of 1990 and the Architectural Barriers Act of 1968 for newly constructed and altered recreational facilities
and outdoor developed areas. The Advisory Committee is composed of owners and operators of various recreational
facilities; persons who design recreational facilities or manufacture related equipment; Federal, State and local
government officials responsible for parks and other outdoor developed areas; and individuals with disabilities
and organizations representing the interests of such persons. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Recreation Access Advisory Committee has formed subcommittees to assist in its work. The subcommittees include:
Places of Amusement; Golf; Play Area Settings; Recreational Boating and Fishing; Developed Outdoor Recreation
Facilities and Areas; and Sports Facilities. The subcommittees will be presenting their recommendations to the
full Committee during the May meeting.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Acoustic Thermometry of Ocean Climate (ATOC) Program, 9500 Gilman 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Drive, La Jolla, CA 92093&hyph;0225. The applicant is requesting 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
authorization to take (by harassment) several species of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
cetaceans, pinnipeds, and sea turtles in California coastal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
waters, during a study designed to assess the effects of low 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
frequency sound associated with the ATOC program on marine 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
mammals and sea turtles. The proposed research is a pilot 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
project which is intended to provide information which can be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
used in assessing the potential environmental effects of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
continuing the ATOC program in a broader context. If a decision 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
is made to continue funding for the broader ATOC program, any 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
potential environmental effects will be assessed in a separate 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
environmental analysis. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The subject research was proposed to be conducted in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
California waters from April 1994 through March 1996. As 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
currently proposed, the sound source will be located due west of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Pt. Sur, California at 850&hyph;950 m depth. The maximum duty cycle 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
will be 8%, with a transmission bandwidth of 20 Hz at a level of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
195 dB (re 1 &mu;Pa at 1m), and with a spectrum level for the center 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
frequency (70 Hz) at 182 dB. The effects of these transmissions 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
on marine mammals and sea turtles will be monitored through the authority of the Marine Mammal Protection Act (MMPA)
of 1972, as

issues currently under consideration by ARPA and NMFS are: the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
potential effects of the proposed low frequency sound source on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
marine mammals, sea turtles, and other marine resources, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
including fish; alternatives with respect to site selection; and, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
as a related issue, the purpose of the ATOC program, and an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
evaluation thereof as compared to other possible alternatives for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
assessing global warming. ARPA and NMFS will also consider as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
part of the scoping process, comments received at a public 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
hearing to be held in California on May 16, 1994, from 5 p.m. to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
10 p.m. at the Santa Cruz Civic Auditorium, 307 Church Street, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Santa Cruz, California co-sponsored with the Monterey Bay 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
National Marine Sanctuary. The period from 5 p.m. to 6 p.m. will be allotted for the applicant to provide a brief description
of an udpated research program. Upon completion of a draft EIS on the proposed application, ARPA and NMFS will solicit
public comments on it, as well.

In the case of pork bellies, there currently are two option contract months based on the underlying February futures
contract month: one contract month that expires on the last Friday that is more than three business days prior to the
first business day of February and a contract month which expires on the third Friday of the November which immediately
precedes the underlying February futures contract month.

The pork bellies option contract's existing terms provide for the listing of 11 strike prices in intervals of two cents
per pound at the commencement of trading in a contract month, including the strike price nearest to the previous day's
settlement price and the next five strike prices above and the next five strike prices below that strike price. The
pork bellies option contract currently provides for the listing of additional strike prices as necessary to maintain
the listing of at least the next five strike prices above and the next five strike prices below the prevailing prices
for the underlying futures contract month. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The live hogs option contract currently provides for the listing at the commencement of trading in a contract month
of all strike prices in intervals of two cents per pound that fall within the range of ten cents above and ten cents below
the previous day's settlement price for the underlying futures contract month. In addition, the live hogs option
contract currently provides that, when a contract month becomes the next-to-expire contract month, all strike prices
that fall within a range of six cents per pound above or six cents per pound below the previous day's settlement price
will be listed in intervals of one cent per pound. The live hogs option contract's existing terms also provide for the
listing of additional strike prices as necessary to ensure that all strike prices at the specified price intervals
are listed within the above-noted ranges of ten and, as appropriate, six cents above and below the prevailing prices
for the underlying futures contract month. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed amendments would provide for the listing of a ``report-based'' cycle of contract months for the live
hog and frozen pork bellies option contracts, in addition to the listing of the ``regular cycle'' of option contract
months currently provided for in the contracts' rules.

In some cases, the USDA Hogs and Pigs report will be released after trading ceases on the last trading day for the proposed
report-based options. For example, the most recent Hogs and Pigs report was released at 2 p.m., Central Time, on Friday,
March 25, 1994 (the USDA releases all Hogs and Pigs reports at 2 p.m., Central Time, on the scheduled release day, which
typically is either a Thursday or Friday). The release time for this report would have followed the 1 p.m., Central
Time, close of trading for live hogs and pork bellies on the last trading day of the report-based options for that month
if such options had been available for listing during March 1994. In such cases, persons who hold report-based option
positions after trading ends on the last trading day would have the right to choose whether to exercise such options
into the underlying futures contract after the USDA report is released. In this respect, the option contracts' current
terms permit persons holding option positions after trading ceases on the last trading day to submit to the CME a notice
that they wish to exercise their report-based option positions until 7 p.m., Central Time, on the last trading day.
For persons holding in-the-money report-based options, the option contracts' existing rules provide that such
options will be automatically exercised by the CME unless instructions to the contrary are submitted to the CME by
the option holder by 7 p.m. on the last trading day.

For report-based options in live hogs, the underlying futures contract will be the second-nearest futures contract
to delivery. For example, the underlying futures contract for a report-based option that is listed in March in connection
with the release of the March Hogs and Pigs report would be the June futures contract month. Similarly, the underlying
futures contracts for the other report-based options to be listed during the calendar year are: the August futures
contract month for the option listed during June; the December futures contract month for the option listed in September;
and the April futures contract month for the option listed in December. The CME shall list initially, and thereafter
maintain, put and call live hogs report-based options with strike prices at one-cent intervals in a range of six-cents
above and below the previous day's settlement price of the underlying futures contract, and at two-cent intervals
in a range 10 cents above and below the previous day's settlement price of the underlying futures contract. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The underlying futures contract months for pork bellies report-based options are: the May futures contract month
for the option listed in March; the August futures contract month for the option listed in June; the February futures
contract month for the option listed in September; and the March futures contract month for the option listed in December.
The CME shall list initially and maintain pork bellies report-based put and call options at eleven strike prices listed
in two-cent intervals, including the strike price that is nearest the previous day's settlement price of the underlying
futures contract, and the next five higher, and the next five lower strike prices. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed amendments will continue to specify the listing of the ``regular cycle'' of option contract months and
the listing of strike prices for such months in the same manner as provided for in the contracts' existing terms. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In support of the proposed amendments, the CME states the following:

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
Options on futures allow hedgers to shield themselves from the adverse impact of a [``Hogs and Pigs''] report while
retaining much of the ability to benefit from a favorable market response. However, for hedgers using options on the
more distant contract months, the high cost of buying an option_due to the large time value component of the option
premium_can outweigh the benefits of protection from an unfavorable market reaction. As a result, many potential
hedgers are effectively priced out of the option market. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Short-dated options would address this problem. Since these options would be traded for such a short time, the time
value component of the option premium would be negligible, and therefore the total premium would be substantially
less than for a traditional long-dated option, all other things being the same. This would make short-dated options
an attractive risk-management tool for hedgers who require protection around the release of these critical reports,
and particularly those whose usage of options is currently limited due to the cost of the premium.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A. Purpose
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
This clearance covers the extension of reporting requirements as required by 41 U.S.C. 253e on Certification of Commercial
Pricing. The clauses at FAR 52.215&hyph;32 and 52.215&hyph;35 require that offerors/contractors certify to the
best of their knowledge and belief that prices offered for certain spare or repair parts that the contractor offers
for sale to the public are no higher than the lowest commercial sales price at which such parts were sold during the most
recent regular monthly, quarterly, or other period for which sales data are reasonably available, provided that
in no event shall this period be less than 30 days in duration. All items for which prices offered are higher than the
lowest commercial sales price discussed above must be identified and a written justification for the differences
supplied.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The commercial pricing information is used by contracting officers to ensure that the Government does not pay prices
for commercial spare and repair parts that exceed the lowest commercial sales prices at which such items are sold by
the contractor to the general public unless the price differences are justified. Without the information, the Government
may pay prices for such supplies that are higher than prices paid by other customers.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 3517 of the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (44 U.S.C. chapter 35) requires that the Office of Management and
Budget (OMB) provide interested Federal agencies and the public an early opportunity to comment on information collection
requests. OMB may amend or waive the requirement for public consultation to the extent that public participation
in the approval process would defeat the purpose of the information collection, violate State or Federal law, or substantially
interfere with any agency's ability to perform its statutory obligations. The Acting Director of the Information
Resources Management Service, publishes this notice containing proposed information collection requests prior
to submission of these requests to OMB. Each proposed information collection, grouped by office, contains the following:
(1) Type of review requested, e.g., new, revision, extension, existing or reinstatement; (2) Title; (3) Frequency
of collection; (4) The affected public; (5) Reporting burden; and/or (6) Recordkeeping burden; and (7) Abstract.
OMB invites public comment at the address specified above. Copies of the requests are available from Wallace McPherson
at the address specified above.

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 In compliance with the National Environmental Policy Act, 42 U.S.C. 4321 et seq., the Council on Environmental Quality's
implementing regulations, 40 CFR parts 1500&hyph;1508, DOE's implementing procedures, 10 CFR part 1021, and Executive
Order 12114, Environmental Effects Abroad of Major Federal Actions, the DOE has prepared an Environmental Assessment
(DOE/EA&hyph;0912, April 1994) to evaluate the potential environmental impacts of the proposed urgent-relief
acceptance of foreign research reactor spent nuclear fuel. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Environmental Assessment analyzed the potential environmental impacts under the proposed action of accepting
up to 409 spent nuclear fuel elements from eight reactors in Europe for storage in an existing DOE wet storage facility
to meet the urgent needs of certain foreign research reactor operators and to avoid failure of a key United States nuclear
weapons nonproliferation objective of minimizing and eventually eliminating the use of highly enriched uranium
in civil programs worldwide. Specifically, the Environmental Assessment analyzed the potential impacts of transporting
the spent nuclear fuel elements by commercial or chartered vessel from eight reactors in Europe to any one of five ports
of entry in the United States (Wilmington, North Carolina; the Army Military Ocean Terminal at Sunny Point, North
Carolina; Charleston, South Carolina; Savannah, Georgia; and Jacksonville, Florida), off-loading the spent fuel
at the port of entry and transporting it by truck or rail to the Savannah River Site, near Aiken, South Carolina; and
storing the spent fuel there until decisions are made regarding interim storage and ultimate disposition. The Nuclear
Waste Policy Act authorizes ultimate disposal of the spent fuel in a geologic repository. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In October 1993, DOE provided a draft Environmental Assessment for comment to the States of Georgia and South Carolina,
and the Commonwealth of Virginia, and interested individuals and organizations. In February 1994, DOE provided
a revised draft Environmental Assessment to the States of Florida, Georgia, North Carolina, and South Carolina,
the Commonwealth of Virginia, and to individuals and groups known to have an interest in the proposed action, and requested
that comments on the draft Environmental Assessment be submitted by March 7, 1994. On February 10, 1994, Federal,
State and local government representatives, citizen groups, individuals and members of the international community
attended a meeting in Washington, DC, to present their views concerning the proposed action. DOE also held public
meetings in communities potentially affected by the proposed acceptance of foreign research reactor spent fuel.
On March 18, 1994, the comment period on the draft Environmental Assessment was extended until April 8, 1994, to provide
an additional opportunity for stakeholders to provide comments. The Environmental Assessment has been revised,
where appropriate, to reflect comments received during the comment period.

<!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Based on an evaluation of the use of either commercial or chartered vessels, the proposed ports of entry and alternative
modes of transporting the spent nuclear fuel (truck or train) from the port of entry to the Savannah River Site, DOE
has concluded that no significant impact would result from receipt of the spent fuel at any of the five proposed ports
and overland transport by rail or truck from the port of entry to the Savannah River Site. Therefore, based on the analysis
in the Environmental Assessment and after careful consideration of all comments from Federal, State and local officials,
members of the public and from the international community, DOE has determined that the acceptance of up to 409 spent
nuclear fuel elements from eight foreign research reactors in Europe for storage at the Savannah River Site does not
constitute a major Federal action significantly affecting the quality of the human environment, within the meaning
of the National Environmental Policy Act. Accordingly, an Environmental Impact Statement is not required and the
DOE is issuing this Finding of No Significant Impact. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
However, upon further consideration, and in an effort to balance the domestic and international interests at stake,
DOE has decided to implement the proposed action as follows. The spent fuel will be shipped either by commercial or
chartered vessel from Europe to the Army's Military Ocean Terminal at Sunny Point, North Carolina to the maximum extent
practicable (rather than allowing the shipper to select from among any one of the five proposed ports as described
in the Environmental Assessment), and transported overland by rail (rather than truck). Should DOE determine that
another port or mode of transport (from among those considered as the proposed action) is necessary, DOE will provide
direct notice of the change to State and local government officials of the affected States and will notify the public
through local media and other means, as appropriate.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 In the 1950's, as part of the ``Atoms for Peace'' program, the United States began providing assistance in the peaceful
application of nuclear technologies to countries that agreed to forego the development of nuclear weapons. This
assistance included the provision of highly enriched uranium for use in research reactors around the world. After
irradiation in the reactor, the used (spent) fuel was transported to the United States, where it was reprocessed to
extract the uranium still remaining in the spent fuel. In this way, the United States maintained control of the highly
enriched uranium, which otherwise could be used to make nuclear weapons. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
To reduce the danger of nuclear weapons proliferation, the United States began a program in 1978 aimed at minimizing
and eventually eliminating the use of highly enriched uranium in civilian reactor programs worldwide. This effort
(the Reduced Enrichment for Research and Test Reactors Program) was directed at replacing the highly enriched uranium
used in research reactors with low enriched uranium, a material that is not directly usable in nuclear weapons. Research
reactors are of particular interest because the major civilian use of highly enriched uranium is as fuel in research
reactors. If research reactors worldwide were to convert to low enriched uranium fuels, highly enriched uranium
essentially would be eliminated from use in civil commerce. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For research reactors converting to low enriched uranium fuel, acceptance of spent fuel by the United States was viewed
as essential to offset the substantial expenses and reduction in reactor efficiency and capability resulting from
conversion. The United States accepted highly enriched uranium spent fuel for several decades, until the program
was allowed to expire in 1988. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
DOE decided in mid-1993 to prepare an Environmental Impact Statement on a new proposed policy to accept, over a 10&hyph;15
year period, up to 15,000 spent fuel elements containing uranium enriched in the United States. The goal of the proposed
long-term policy would be to recover highly enriched uranium exported from the United States, while giving foreign
research reactor operators sufficient time to develop their own long-term solutions for storage and disposal of
spent fuel. Although the Environmental Impact Statement is under preparation, DOE does not expect to complete the
analysis and make a decision on whether to implement the policy until mid to late 1995.

<!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Because DOE has not accepted any spent fuel containing uranium enriched in the United States for more than five years,
several foreign research reactor operators are running out of storage capacity and facing safety and regulatory
issues associated with the presence of spent fuel at their sites. If the United States is unable to commit now to the
near-term acceptance of a small amount of foreign research reactor spent fuel, several reactor operators soon will
either shut down their reactors or ship their spent fuel offsite for reprocessing. Neither option would serve the
nonproliferation interests of the United States. Thus, at the urging of the Department of State, DOE is proposing
to accept a small number of highly enriched uranium spent fuel elements in the near term for storage in an existing federal
facility in South Carolina. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
DOE believes that preparation of the Environmental Assessment, which analyzes the potential environmental impacts
of the proposed urgent-relief acceptance of a small number of spent fuel elements before the Environmental Impact
Statement is completed, fully complies with the National Environmental Policy Act and its implementing regulations.
The proposed near-term acceptance is justified independently of the decision on whether to establish a new policy
on the proposed long-term acceptance of foreign research reactor spent fuel. Until the Environmental Impact Statement
is completed and a decision made whether to implement the proposed long-term acceptance policy, the proposed acceptance
of a small number of spent fuel elements is necessary to maintain the United States program of encouraging the conversion
by research reactors to low enriched uranium fuel. Further, while there is an obvious relationship between the two
proposals, a decision to accept such a small number of fuel elements does not foreclose or prejudice future decisions
regarding establishment of a new spent fuel acceptance policy, or the decisions regarding interim storage or ultimate
disposition of spent nuclear fuel. (In the Programmatic Spent Nuclear Fuel Management Environmental Impact Statement,
due to be completed by June 1995, DOE is considering where to manage all spent fuel within the DOE complex nationwide
for the interim period prior to ultimate disposition.) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In October 1993, to ensure that countries currently possessing spent fuel continue to support the nonproliferation
initiatives of the United States embodied in the Reduced Enrichment for Research and Test Reactor Program until the
ongoing Environmental Impact Statement can be completed, DOE issued for comment a draft Environmental Assessment
which evaluated the proposed urgent-relief acceptance of up to 700 elements of foreign research reactor spent nuclear
fuel containing uranium enriched in the United States. It was apparent from the comments that DOE received in response
to the October 1993 draft that many people did not agree that there is a need for the United States to accept this spent
fuel. Others expressed concerns regarding DOE's plans for implementing the proposed action. Subsequent to the release
of the October 1993 draft Environmental Assessment and after consideration of comments received, teams of experts
from the United States visited foreign research reactors in Europe and Australia to assess the near-term need for
acceptance of foreign research reactor spent fuel elements before the Environmental Impact Statement on the proposed
long-term acceptance policy is completed. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In February 1994, a revised draft Environmental Assessment, which included revisions made in response to comments
received on the October 1993 draft Environmental Assessment, was prepared and issued for public review and comment.
The proposed action evaluated in the February draft Environmental Assessment was to accept 448 highly enriched uranium
spent fuel elements shipped by sea to any one of seven ports (Newport News, Norfolk, or Portsmouth, Virginia; Charleston,
South Carolina; Wilmington, North Carolina; Savannah, Georgia; and Jacksonville, Florida) and then by truck to
DOE's Savannah River Site near Aiken, South Carolina, for storage. The comment period on the revised draft Environmental
Assessment was scheduled to close on March 7, 1994. On February 10, 1994, DOE and the Department of State co-hosted
a meeting of stakeholders from State and local governments, Congress, environmental and non-proliferation public
interest groups, other private sector interest groups, foreign research reactor operators and key affected communities.
The purpose of that meeting was to involve stakeholders in a meaningful and constructive dialogue on the proposed
urgent-relief acceptance of a small number of spent fuel elements from foreign research reactors. Subsequent to
that meeting and based on concerns raised by local communities potentially affected by the proposed action, DOE extended
the comment period on the February draft Environmental Assessment until April 8, 1994.

Proposed Action
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The DOE proposes to accept up to 409 spent nuclear fuel elements containing highly enriched uranium of United States
origin from eight research reactors in seven European countries (Austria, Denmark, Germany, Greece, Netherlands,
Sweden and Switzerland). The spent fuel would be shipped across the ocean in up to 15 spent fuel transportation casks
from the country of origin to one or more United States eastern seaboard ports. The casks are expected to be transported
in the next several months either by commercial container ships or chartered ships. Several casks could be transported
together on a single ship to any one of the five proposed ports of entry: Wilmington and the United States Army's Military
Ocean Terminal at Sunny Point, North Carolina; Charleston, South Carolina; Savannah, Georgia; and Jacksonville,
Florida.

<!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
After arriving in the United States, the casks would be transported to DOE's Savannah River Site near Aiken, South
Carolina, where the fuel elements would be stored underwater in an existing storage facility (the Receiving Basin
for Offsite Fuels).

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Routine Operation:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 During routine (non-accident condition) ocean transport, there would be no impact to the marine environment. Radiation
exposure from the very small radiation fields being emitted from the casks_about 1 millirem per hour at 1 meter from
the cask surface_would be limited primarily to crew members who inspect the cargo on a daily basis to ensure secure
stowage and structural safety of the vessel. Incident-free dose estimates to these crew members would be essentially
the same regardless of the port of entry, largely because the exposure is proportional to the numbers of inspections
over time. Distances and time of transit are similar from the European ports to the proposed United States ports of
entry. Assuming that the ship makes three intermediate port stops and then unloads at the fourth stop, the incident-free
dose to a ship cargo inspector is estimated to be 4.3 millirem for shipments into Sunny Point and Wilmington, North
Carolina; 4.5 millirem for shipments into Charleston, South Carolina; and 4.6 millirem for shipments into Jacksonville,
Florida and Savannah, Georgia. The likelihood of a single fatal cancer among the entire crew of all the ships used in
the proposed action is approximately one in 450,000. If no intermediate port stops are assumed, the collective dose
would be reduced by approximately 30 percent. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Because container cargo handling is relatively uniform throughout the world, exposure to port workers (handlers/inspectors)
also would be essentially the same regardless of the port of entry. Using a conservative assumption, i.e., the same
handler/inspector inspects all shipments, the maximally exposed port worker would receive a dose of approximately
5.2 millirem. The collective exposure (assuming the same crew of handlers/inspectors for all shipments) to the handlers/inspectors
is estimated as 0.078 person-rem (0.0052 rem &times; 15 workers). The likelihood of a single individual port worker
dying from cancer as a result of the proposed action is about 1 in 380,000. Dose to members of the general public during
port operations would be extremely low because residences are separated from dock facilities by buffer spaces such
as parking lots, warehouses and other port facilities. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
During truck transport of the spent fuel from the port of entry to the Savannah River Site, the maximally exposed individual
truck crew member (assuming the same person is involved in all truck shipments) would receive 2.4 millirem for shipments
from Charleston, South Carolina; 2.7 millirem for shipments from Savannah, Georgia; 4.1 millirem for shipments
from Wilmington, North Carolina; 4.5 millirem for shipments from Sunny Point, North Carolina; and 3.9 millirem for
shipments from Jacksonville, Florida. The likelihood of a single crew member dying from cancer as a result of transporting
spent fuel from Sunny Point to the Savannah River Site is about 1 in 440,000. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The maximum exposure to an individual not actively involved in shipping the spent fuel during routine transport was
estimated for two cases: (1) a member of the public who lives beside the highway route (this individual was assumed
to be exposed to each of the 15 truck shipments at a distance of 30 meters); and (2) an individual located near a stopped
truck, e.g., in a traffic jam. The maximum in-transit dose under the first instance was calculated to be 0.002 millirem
for routine operations. A dose of 0.002 millirem would increase the risk of a latent cancer fatality by 1 in one billion.
For the second case, an individual could receive doses higher than 0.002 millirem depending on the duration of the
stop and the distance of the individual from the truck. For example, in the unlikely event that a person was standing
outside a stopped truck for a period of 1/2 hour at a distance of two meters, the person could receive a dose of one millirem.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Since port workers, inspectors, and truck drivers are not considered radiation workers, as defined by the Nuclear
Regulatory Commission (NRC), the maximum annual allowable exposure for these personnel would be 100 millirem, the
same radiation dose limit established by the NRC to protect the individual members of the general public. As discussed
above, during normal transport of the spent nuclear fuel, the maximum annual exposure to the public, port workers,
inspectors, and truck drivers would be well below the 100 millirem dose limit, and no doses large enough to result in
acute health effects are predicted among either the workers or general public for the proposed action. The cumulative
annual incident-free dose from the proposed activity to all persons potentially exposed would range between 0.12
person-rem (Charleston and Savannah) and 0.16 person-rem (Sunny Point). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Currently, the average annual individual worker dose at the Receiving Basin for Off-Site Fuels (RBOF) for all operations
(unloading, handling and storage of the spent nuclear fuel elements) is approximately 150 millirem. Based on very
conservative assumptions, i.e., all 409 spent fuel elements are received in a one-year period and the same individuals
unload all 15 casks, the maximum annual increase in the average individual dose to a worker at RBOF is estimated to be
60 millirem. This dose would be well below both the DOE limit of 5,000 millirem per year for radiation workers and the
DOE Administrative control level of 2,000 millirem per year per person, for all DOE activities. Once the spent fuel
elements were stored under water in the RBOF, the increase in radiation exposure to facility personnel from the storage
of the foreign spent fuel elements would not be detectable. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Only minor environmental impacts would be expected from the proposed action because the receipt and storage of up
to 409 spent fuel elements represents only a small increase to existing site activity and involves no new construction.
Approximately 15 cubic feet of laundry type waste and 5.5 cubic feet of solid waste would be generated per cask. The
proposed action would add less than 4 percent to the average annual solid waste normally generated at RBOF. Receipt
and storage of foreign research reactor spent nuclear fuel would have no effect on the types, quantities or utilization
of hazardous compounds stored at RBOF, and no incremental risk to workers would be expected.

<!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In the extremely unlikely event of an accidental fire at sea in which a cask was sufficiently damaged by the fire to release
its contents, members of the ship crew near the fire would be exposed to the released radioactive material. However,
any crew member close enough to the fire to suffer a significant radiation dose likely would be more severely injured
from the fire than the radiation dose. If crew members were to survive the fire, radiological impacts would be similar
to those resulting from a severe accident in port, which would result in a maximum exposure to workers and the public
of approximately 0.21 person-rem. This exposure would result in an approximately one in 9,500 chance of one additional
cancer in the entire exposed population. If such an accident were to occur at sea, however, there would be essentially
no exposure to members of the public, and all released activity would be deposited in the ocean. Assuming that the spent
fuel cask lay on the ocean floor where it slowly released its radioactive inventory, the peak doses to biota residing
on the ocean floor in or near the uppermost sediment layer are estimated to be 0.11 rad (radiation adsorbed dose) per
year for fish, 0.17 rad per year for crustaceans and 7.3 rad per year for mollusks. The radioactive material would be
expected to disperse and to be diluted due to the influence of ocean currents. Since deleterious effects of chronic
irradiation have not been observed in natural populations at dose rates of less than 365 rad, no significant impacts
would be expected. Further, uranium, the major constituent of the spent fuel, has not been found to bioaccumulate
in fish and bioaccumulates only slightly in crustaceans and mollusks. No significant chemical hazard would be expected
from the release of the contents of the spent fuel elements into the open ocean. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Spent fuel casks are designed to withstand at least a 15-meter immersion, and it has been demonstrated that the cask
seals will remain intact at much greater depths. Further, damaged and undamaged casks can be recovered readily from
water up to 200 meters deep. Recovery from depths of up to 2,000 meters may be possible, but would be costly. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In an extreme situation, where the accident occurs in coastal wasters, the spent fuel is not recovered, and both the
spent fuel and cask are damaged, the peak dose to an individual is estimated to be 11 millirem per year. This individual
is assumed to reside near the shore and to eat seafood (fish, mollusk, seaweed) harvested from the area in the immediate
vicinity of the spent fuel cask. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In the event of the most severe port accident (major mechanical damage, fire, oxidation of 100 percent of the fuel,
and release of radioactive material from a cask containing 33 spent fuel elements), the dose to a maximally exposed
individual, i.e., an individual assumed to be standing outside approximately 100 feet away from the event and remaining
there for 24 hours, would be 25 rem. At such close distance, it is highly probable that the individuals, if not evacuated,
would be harmed more by the explosion and fire engulfing the cask than by the radiation dose. If the individual were
inside a building approximately 100 feet away and remained there for 24 hours after the accident, the dose would be
reduced to 0.22 rem. At a more likely distance, where an individual may be located outside for a period of 24 hours after
the accident, the dose at 0.6 miles would be 0.21 rem. If the person were inside at the same distance, the dose would be
0.002 rem. When considered in conjunction with the unlikely probability of occurrence (approximately 1 chance in
7.7 million), the accident has an extremely small risk. For example, the risk of developing a single fatal cancer for
the most severe case, i.e., individual outside, 100 feet away for 24 hours receiving 25 rem, is about 1 chance in 600
million. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In the event of an overland accident, assuming the surrounding population remains there for a 24-hour period, the
estimated population dose risk is 0.0000015 person-rem for transport from Savannah, 0.0000018 person-rem from
Charleston, 0.0000028 person-rem from Wilmington, 0.0000024 person-rem from Jacksonville, and 0.0000035 person-rem
from Sunny Point. While there would be slightly different risks among the different ports, no significant impacts
would result. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Four hypothetical accidents at RBOF were evaluated that could potentially release radionuclides to the atmosphere.
These accidents include: (1) A nuclear criticality incident; (2) a fire and explosion at RBOF; (3) accidental cutting
of fuel element cores; and (4) rupture or failure of fuel elements during underwater storage. The maximum dose was
attributed to the unlikely accident of 1000 foreign fuel elements rupturing during storage at RBOF. This event would
result in an 8.3 millirem maximum dose to the individual at the site boundary and a 70 person-rem dose for the offsite
population. The probability of such an accident occurring, however, would be less than one in 2000 years. When the
probability is taken into account, there would be an additional 1 in 500 million chance that the individual at the site
boundary would develop a fatal cancer, and a 1 in 55,000 chance that a single fatal cancer would occur in the exposed
populations.

Environmental Impacts of Alternatives
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Alternatives considered in the Environmental Assessment include no action, receipt of a greater or lesser number
of spent fuel elements, alternate ports of entry, alternative modes of transport from the receiving port to the Savannah
River Site, and reprocessing abroad and transport of low or highly enriched uranium to the United States. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
No Action:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Under the No Action Alternative, there would be no environmental impact in the United States. However, United States
nonproliferation policy would be adversely affected. Foreign reactor operators will try to avoid shutting down
their reactors. The operators of two reactors can elect to reprocess their spent fuel at an existing facility in Scotland,
although one of the two would need United States authorization to do so. Reprocessing would allow the uranium to be
extracted for reuse, and thus would increase the threat of nuclear proliferation. Reactor operators in Belgium and
Germany resorted to reprocessing on four occasions in 1993 and 1994. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Six of the eight research reactors from which DOE proposes to accept spent fuel either do not have the option to reprocess
their spent fuel or could not obtain regulatory authority to reprocess in time to avoid shutdown. Shutdown of these
reactors would severely undermine the United States' credibility as a reliable partner in matters of nuclear cooperation.
This, in turn, could influence other reactor operators to cease their conversion to low enriched fuel or to revert
to the use of highly enriched fuel if they have already converted. In fact, several reactor operators have stated that,
if the United States is unable to accept spent fuel, they will cancel or delay their reactor conversions to low enriched
uranium fuel. Such actions would encourage development of a world market for highly enriched uranium, thereby undermining
a key aspect of the United States nonproliferation program. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Selection of the No Action Alternative would also adversely affect the upcoming 1995 international conference on
the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons. The conference will consider the indefinite extension of
the Treaty, which the United States strongly supports. Other Treaty parties will want assurance that the United States
has fulfilled its obligations under the Treaty to share the benefits of peaceful nuclear cooperation. If several
countries that are parties to the Treaty are compelled to shut down their research reactors, thereby foregoing the
benefits from these reactors, the United States may be accused, fairly or unfairly, of not sharing the benefits of
peaceful nuclear cooperation. Such an accusation, however ill-founded, could create or increase opposition to
the indefinite extension of the Treaty, which is the foundation for the international nuclear weapons nonproliferation
regime.

Greater or Lesser Number of Spent Fuel Elements Accepted:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 In addition to the proposed action (shipment of up to 409 spent nuclear fuel elements), the environmental impacts
of shipping alternative numbers of spent fuel elements (i.e., 953, 359, 291, and 248 spent fuel elements) were also
considered in the Environmental Assessment. The risks for the 953-element alternative are slightly more than double
the risks for shipping 409 elements through the proposed ports. Conversely, the risks of shipping 359, 291 and 248
elements are less than the risks for shipping 409 elements. While there are differences in the risks depending upon
the number of elements shipped, the impacts associated with the shipment of any alternative number of elements are
extremely small.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Acceptance of up to 409 spent fuel elements would allow the foreign research reactors to ship full casks, and would
not force the two reactors that can ship spent fuel to Scotland for reprocessing to do so. (Acceptance of 359 spent fuel
elements, i.e., shipment in partially full casks, also would not force these two reactors to reprocess.) In proposing
to accept full casks, DOE took note of the fact that there is no significant difference in the environmental impacts
between shipping full and partially full casks. Further, shipping full casks is the customary shipping procedure,
and more cost-effective. Accordingly, proposing to accept full casks appeared to be a prudent course to encourage
the continued participation of foreign research reactors in the Reduced Enrichment for Research and Test Reactors
Program. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Other Ports of Entry:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Environmental Assessment also evaluated the impacts of shipping 409 spent fuel elements through alternate commercial
and military ports using two assumptions: (1) No intermediate port stops and eight casks per vessel; and (2) three
intermediate port stops and one cask per vessel. Dose to handlers and port workers would be essentially the same from
port to port. During ocean transport, dose to the ship's crew would be generally the same regardless of the port of entry.
However, dose to the truck's crew showed some slight variation consistent with the distance of travel, i.e., slightly
higher doses are associated with greater distances traveled. The dose to the ship's crew and the dose to the truck crew
would be well below the 100 millirem limit for nonradiation workers. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
None of the alternate ports appeared as advantageous for the proposed receipt of spent fuel as the five proposed ports
based on the application of screening criteria drawn from the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year
1994, and additional criteria recommended by a panel of maritime experts at a DOE-sponsored workshop on port selection
criteria for shipments of spent fuel. While there are comparative advantages and disadvantages among the five proposed
ports, all five of the proposed ports appear comparatively more advantageous than other United States seaports for
the proposed action. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Other Modes of Overland Transport:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The spent nuclear fuel could be transported by rail from the port of entry to the Savannah River Site. The incident-free
dose to spent fuel cask handlers would depend on how the casks were handled in port. If two casks are shipped per rail
car, the handler would continue to receive a small dose from the first loaded cask as the second cask is loaded. Dose
would also be influenced by the number of cargo transfers required. For example, if the spent fuel cask cannot be off-loaded
directly from the ship to a rail car, spent fuel cask handlers would receive an additional small dose during the transport
by truck to the rail car and from the transfer of the cask from the truck to the rail car. In addition, rail cargo is inspected
after loading and prior to off-loading. As a result, transport by rail would result in a slightly higher dose to port
handlers/inspectors and rail crew than transport by truck. Dose to the public, however, would be generally lower,
partly because rail stops would normally occur in rail yards (removed from the general population). For example,
rail transport from Sunny Point to the Savannah River Site would result in an annual dose of 0.16 person-rem total to
port handlers/inspectors, other port workers and rail crew, and in a dose of 0.0017 person-rem to members of the public.
Truck transport of the spent fuel from Sunny Point to the Savannah River Site would result in an annual dose of 0.08 person-rem
to port handlers/inspectors, other port workers and truck crew and a dose of 0.067 person-rem to members of the public.
Neither mode of transport would result in a significant health effect.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Reprocessing Abroad and Transport of Low or Highly Enriched Uranium to the United States:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The potential environmental impact of transporting low enriched uranium by ship to the United States after reprocessing
the spent fuel abroad was analyzed in detail in two recently issued Environmental Assessments prepared by the United
States Enrichment Corporation. Low enriched uranium was found to be a common commercial product that has been shipped
safely around the world in large quantities by air, water, and land transport modes for over 30 years without significant
impact. Consequently, if the spent nuclear fuel elements were reprocessed in Europe (i.e., at Dounreay, Scotland),
blended down to low enriched uranium, and the low enriched uranium was returned to the United States, no significant
impacts would be expected. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If the spent fuel were reprocessed in Scotland, but not blended down, then highly enriched uranium could be transported
from Scotland to the United States for blending. The shipment of highly enriched uranium would require extensive
security activities and would involve the use of military assets for protection and safety. The military has had considerable
experience in shipment of highly enriched uranium and has safely transported such materials throughout the world
without significant impact. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
These options, however, would not serve the nonproliferation interests of the United States. As discussed above
and in greater detail in the Environmental Assessment, reprocessing would likely result in reactor operators postponing
conversion from highly enriched uranium fuel, or reverting back to its use if conversion has already been completed.
This is because the only current reprocessor of highly enriched uranium does not reprocess low enriched uranium fuel,
and reactor operators have only limited capacity to store spent fuel generated as a result of operating. Thus, to continue
operating, research reactors would have to continue to use highly enriched uranium fuels. In addition, for those
reactors for which United States consent is not required for reprocessing to occur, there is no mechanism to implement
or to enforce a blending requirement by the reactor operators or reprocessors. Consequently, reactor operators
could elect to have their fuel reprocessed, but not blended. This would result in the continued use of highly enriched
uranium fuel by research reactors, contrary to United States nonproliferation policy.

Enhanced Storage in Europe:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 DOE considered but rejected as unreasonable the alternative of assisting foreign research reactors to expand spent
fuel storage capacity at the reactor sites or at other sites in Europe. By the time new facilities could be constructed
and licensed, or existing facilities modified, the reactors from which DOE proposes to accept spent fuel would have
been forced to send their spent fuel to Scotland for reprocessing, where that is an option, or to shut down. For the reasons
discussed above and in greater detail in the Environmental Assessment, forcing research reactors to shut down or
reprocess would undermine the gains already realized in converting to low enriched uranium fuels under the Reduced
Enrichment for Research and Test Reactors Program. The governments in the countries where these reactors are located
have stated that acceptance of spent fuel has become a measure of the United States' reliability in worldwide nuclear
cooperation. A perceived lack of reliability could complicate upcoming negotiations for renewal of important nonproliferation
agreements.

In addition to the environmental impacts from the proposed action, the Environmental Assessment also considered

radioactive materials to the Barnwell facility, east of the Savannah River Site. No significant cumulative effects
were identified.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Based on the analyses in the Environmental Assessment, and after careful consideration of comments received, DOE
has determined that the acceptance of up to 409 spent nuclear fuel elements from eight foreign research reactors in
Europe for storage at the Savannah River Site does not constitute a major Federal action significantly affecting
the quality of the human environment, within the meaning of the National Environmental Policy Act. Therefore, an
Environmental Impact Statement is not required and DOE issues this Finding of No Significant Impact. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

Based on an evaluation of the five proposed ports of entry (Jacksonville, Florida; Savannah, Georgia; the Army Military
Ocean Terminal at Sunny Point, and Wilmington, North Carolina; and Charleston, South Carolina) and alternative
modes of transporting the spent nuclear fuel from the port of entry to the Savannah River Site (truck or train), DOE
has concluded that no significant impact would result from any combination of proposed port and mode of transport
from the port of entry to the Savannah River Site. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
However, upon further consideration, and in an effort to balance the domestic and international interests at stake,
DOE has decided to implement the proposed action as follows. The spent nuclear fuel will be shipped by commercial or
chartered vessel from Europe to the Army's Military Ocean Terminal at Sunny Point, North Carolina to the maximum extent
practicable (rather than allowing the shipper to select from among any one of the five proposed ports as described
in the Environmental Assessment) and transported overland by rail (rather than truck). Should DOE determine that
another port or mode of transport (from among those considered as the proposed action) is necessary, DOE will provide
direct notice of the change to State and local government officials of the affected states and will notify the public
through local media and other means, as appropriate.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
In support of DOE's Math/Science Education Action Conference Report of May 1990 which emphasized the critical need
for a technologically informed citizenry and the need for American elementary and secondary students to receive
increased preparation in math and science in every grade and that teachers must become empowered to prepare this generation
of children for lives in the 21st Century, various methods are being explored and pursued to accomplish these aims.
Surveys have found that many K&hyph;12 teachers have little or no background in science or need to enhance and update
their skills in this field. A science literacy course covering such fields as astronomy, geology, chemistry, math,
physics, origins of life, evolution, global warming, electromagnetic fields, population explosion, ionizing
radiation and the health effects of radiation, has been developed to increase and stimulate a teacher's interest
and understanding of the sciences and the concept of the scientific approach to societal issues involving science
and/or technology. Some simple, inexpensive experiments are offered which can be used by the teachers in the classroom
to demonstrate scientific principles. Experts in various science fields are utilized as lecturers to provide quality
instruction. Teachers who complete the course generally overcome their fears of science and transfer a sense of excitement
in science to their students.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 Alaska Power Administration (APA) is proposing to adjust the rates for the Eklutna Project. Rates of 17 mills per kilowatthour
for firm energy, 10 mills per kilowatthour for non-firm energy and .3 mills per kilowatthour for wheeling expire September
30, 1994. APA proposes to raise the rate for firm energy to 18.9 mills per kilowatthour beginning October 1, 1994 for
a period of up to five years. Rates for non-firm energy and wheeling would remain the same. APA will finalize the proposal
giving full consideration to comments received. The final proposal may differ from the present. The proposed rates
will be submitted to the Deputy Secretary of Energy for interim approval and to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission
for review and final approval.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The proposed rates apply for power sold from the Eklutna Hydroelectric Project to three electric utilities serving
the Anchorage and Matanuska Valley areas of Alaska. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Details of the proposed rates, including supporting studies, are available for inspection at Alaska Power Administration,
2770 Sherwood Lane, Suite 2B, Juneau, Alaska; and the Eklutna Project Office, Mile 4.0, Old Glenn Highway, Palmer,
Alaska. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A public information and comment forum is scheduled to be held June 14, 1994, at 7 p.m., in the public conference room
of the Loussac Library, 3600 Denali, Anchorage, Alaska. APA is requesting that the parties interested in attending
the public information and comment forum notify APA of this intent in writing by June 7, 1994. If APA has not received
any written notices of intent to attend the forum the APA Administrator will cancel the forum, as allowed in 10 CFR 903.15(c)
and 10 CFR 903.16(c). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Authorities for the proposed rate action are the Eklutna Project Act of July 31, 1950 (64 Stat. 382, as amended) and
the Department of Energy Organization Act (Pub. L. 95&hyph;91). Alaska Power Administration is developing these
rates in accordance with DOE financial reporting policies, procedures and methodology (DOE Policy RA 6120.2 [September
20, 1979]), and the procedures for public participation in rate adjustments found in 10 CFR Part 903 (1987) as amended.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The present rates went into effect in October 1990. APA has repaid over 75% of the project investment. Since the last
rate action Operation and Maintenance (O&amp;M) costs have increased. The major contributors to this increase are
the addition of the Government's unfunded liability for the Civil Service Retirement System in the repayment studies,
and an increase in the number of staff dealing with environmental compliance issues. The proposed rate results in
an 11% rate increase. This is below the rate of inflation from 1990 to 1994. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
APA has notified its customers that a rate was being developed. One of the customers has asked that APA look at the increased
O&amp;M costs and to verify the need for the increases. APA is in the process of doing this and will include the results
of this evaluation in the final rate proposal. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Given the age of the Eklutna Project, APA expects sizeable replacement costs over the next several years. These costs

been providing borderline service to Pike. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

By an Order issued July 30, 1993 in Commission Docket No. PL93&hyph;2&hyph;002, the Commission held that, in recognition
of the character of the borderline service provided, the Commission had adopted as the wholesale rate the neighboring
utility's retail rate, provided that the utility documents the state commission's approval of the retail rate. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under the tendered amendments, Met-Ed would (1) terminate its Borderline Service Agreement, dated July 22, 1980,
with Pike, and (2) file as its Borderline Rate Schedule for borderline service to Pike the Met-Ed retail Rate Schedule
that is currently on file with the Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission (PaPUC) which was approved by the PaPUC.

Take notice that on April 20, 1994, Arizona Public Service Company (APS) tendered for filing the Reciprocal Transmission
Service Agreement (Agreement) between APS and PacifiCorp. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The enclosed Agreement essentially proposed two transmission service arrangements: (1) APS will provide 30 MW of
interim firm transmission service for PacifiCorp over the Cholla/Four Corners System until PacifiCorp's Four Corners/Borah-Brady
System is able to accommodate additional transmission for APS; and (2) at such time as PacifiCorp's Four Corners/Borah-Brady
System has sufficient capacity to accommodate additional transmission for APS, the Agreement then converts to a
classical ``reciprocal'' type arrangement whereby APS and PacifiCorp will each provide 30 MW of firm unidirectional
reciprocal transmission to the other.

Take notice that on April 12, 1994, Columbia Gulf Transmission Company (Columbia Gulf), P.O. Box 683, Houston, Texas
77001, filed in Docket No. CP94&hyph;352&hyph;000 an application pursuant to section 7(b) of the Natural Gas Act
for permission and approval to abandon a transportation service for Tennessee Gas Pipeline Company, a Division of
Tenneco Inc., which was authorized in Docket No. CP83&hyph;197&hyph;000, all as more fully set forth in the application
on file with the Commission and open to public inspection.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Columbia Gulf proposes to abandon transportation service performed under a gas transportation agreement dated
January 10, 1983, as amended, and pursuant to Columbia Gulf's Rate Schedule X&hyph;86. Columbia Gulf states that
it has been transporting up to 12,000 Dekatherms of natural gas per day from South Marsh Island Block 99, Offshore Louisiana,
to the interconnection of its line and the Blue Water System in South Marsh Island Block 74. It is stated that the transportation
is subject to a monthly demand charge.

SUMMARY: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
Today's notice publishes a letter granting an Interim Waiver to Armstrong Air Conditioning Inc. (Armstrong) from
the existing Department of Energy (DOE) test procedure regarding blower time delay for the company's GUK and GCK condensing
gas furnaces, and GUJ, GCJ, and GHJ non-condensing gas furnaces.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Today's notice also publishes a ``Petition for Waiver'' from Armstrong. Armstrong's Petition for Waiver requests
DOE to grant relief from the DOE furnace test procedure relating to the blower time delay specification. Armstrong
seeks to test using a blower delay time of 30 seconds for its GUK and GCK condensing gas furnaces and GUJ, GCJ, and GHJ
non-condensing gas furnaces instead of the specified 1.5&hyph;minute delay between burner on-time and blower on-time.
The Department is soliciting comments, data, and information respecting the Petition for Waiver.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Energy Conservation Program for Consumer Products (other than automobiles) was established pursuant to the
Energy Policy and Conservation Act (EPCA), Public Law 94&hyph;163, 89 Stat. 917, as amended by the National Energy
Conservation Policy Act (NECPA), Public Law 95&hyph;619, 92 Stat. 3266, the National Appliance Energy Conservation
Act of 1987 (NAECA), Public Law 100&hyph;12, the National Appliance Energy Conservation Amendments of 1988 (NAECA
1988), Public Law 100&hyph;357, and the Energy Policy Act of 1992 (EPAct), Public Law 102&hyph;486, 106 Stat. 2776,
which requires DOE to prescribe standardized test procedures to measure the energy consumption of certain consumer
products, including furnaces. The intent of the test procedures is to provide a comparable measure of energy consumption
that will assist consumers in making purchasing decisions. These test procedures appear at 10 CFR part 430, subpart
B.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Department amended the prescribed test procedures by adding 10 CFR 430.27 on September 26, 1980, creating the
waiver process. 45 FR 64108. Thereafter, DOE further amended the appliance test procedure waiver process to allow
the Assistant Secretary for Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy (Assistant Secretary) to grant an Interim Waiver
from test procedure requirements to manufacturers that have petitioned DOE for a waiver of such prescribed test procedures.
51 FR 42823, November 26, 1986.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The waiver process allows the Assistant Secretary to waive temporarily, test procedures for a particular basic model
when a petitioner shows that the basic model contains one or more design characteristics which prevent testing according
to the prescribed test procedures, or when the prescribed test procedures may evaluate the basic model in a manner
so unrepresentative of its true energy consumption as to provide materially inaccurate comparative data. Waivers
generally remain in effect until final test procedure amendments become effective, resolving the problem that is
the subject of the waiver.

<!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Interim Waiver provisions added by the 1986 amendment allow the Secretary to grant an Interim Waiver when it is
determined that the applicant will experience economic hardship if the Application for Interim Waiver is denied,
if it appears likely that the Petition for Waiver will be granted, and/or the Assistant Secretary determines that
it would be desirable for public policy reasons to grant immediate relief pending a determination on the Petition
for Waiver. An Interim Waiver remains in effect for a period of 180 days or until DOE issues its determination on the
Petition for Waiver, whichever is sooner, and may be extended for an additional 180 days, if necessary.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On March 11, 1994, and the addendum of April 6, 1994, Armstrong filed an Application for Interim Waiver regarding blower
time delay. Armstrong's Application seeks an Interim Waiver from the DOE test provisions that require a 1.5-minute
time delay between the ignition of the burner and starting of the circulating air blower. Instead, Armstrong requests
the allowance to test using a 30-second blower time delay when testing its GUK and GCK condensing gas furnaces and GUJ,
GCJ, and GHJ non-condensing gas furnaces. Armstrong states that the 30-second delay is indicative of how these furnaces
actually operate. Such a delay results in an increase in AFUE of 1.2 percentage points for GUK and GCK condensing gas
furnaces, and 0.8 percentage point for GUJ, GCJ, and GHJ non-condensing gas furnaces. Since current DOE test procedures
do not address this variable blower time delay, Armstrong asks that the Interim Waiver be granted.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department has published a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking on August 23, 1993, (58 FR 44583) to amend the furnace
test procedure, which addresses the above issue.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Previous waivers for this type of time blower delay control have been granted by DOE to Coleman Company, 50 FR 2710,

1991, 57 FR 10163, March 24, 1992, and 58 FR 68134, December 23, 1993; Armstrong Air Conditioning, Inc., 57 FR 899, January
9, 1992, 57 FR 10160, March 24, 1992, 57 FR 10161, March 24, 1992, 57 FR 39193, August 28, 1992, and 57 FR 54230, November
17, 1992; Thermo Products, Inc., 57 FR 903, January 9, 1992; Consolidated Industries Corporation, 57 FR 22220, May
27, 1992; Evcon Industries, Inc., 57 FR 47847, October 20, 1992; and Bard Manufacturing Company, 57 FR 53733, November
12, 1992. Thus, it appears likely that the Petition for Waiver will be granted for blower time delay.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In those instances where the likely success of the Petition for Waiver has been demonstrated based upon DOE having
granted a waiver for a similar product design, it is in the public interest to have similar products tested and rated
for energy consumption on a comparable basis.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Therefore, based on the above, DOE is granting Armstrong an Interim Waiver for its GUK and GCK condensing gas furnaces
and GUJ, GCJ, and GHJ non-condensing gas furnaces. Pursuant to paragraph (e) of &sect;430.27 of the Code of Federal
Regulations part 430, the following letter granting the Application for Interim Waiver to Armstrong was issued.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Pursuant to paragraph (b) of 10 CFR 430.27, DOE is hereby publishing the ``Petition for Waiver'' in its entirety. The
petition contains no confidential information. The Department solicits comments, data, and information respecting
the petition.

likely that the Petition for Waiver will be granted for blower time delay.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Armstrong's Application for Interim Waiver does not provide sufficient information to evaluate what, if any, economic
impact or competitive disadvantage Armstrong will likely experience absent a favorable determination on its application.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
However, in those instances where the likely success of the Petition for Waiver has been demonstrated, based upon
DOE having granted a waiver for a similar product design, it is in the public interest to have similar products tested
and rated for energy consumption on a comparable basis.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Therefore, Armstrong's Application for an Interim Waiver from the DOE test procedure for its GUK and GCK condensing
gas furnaces, and GUJ, GCJ, and GHJ non-condensing gas furnaces regarding blower time delay is granted.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Armstrong shall be permitted to test its GUK and GCK condensing gas furnaces, and GUJ, GCJ, and GHJ non-condensing
gas furnaces on the basis of the test procedures specified in 10 CFR Part 430, Subpart B, Appendix N, with the modification
set forth below:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) Section 3.0 in Appendix N is deleted and replaced with the following paragraph:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3.0&blank;Test Procedure. Testing and measurements shall be as specified in Section 9 in ANSI/ASHRAE 103&hyph;82
with the exception of Sections 9.2.2, 9.3.1, and 9.3.2, and the inclusion of the following additional procedures:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) Add a new paragraph 3.10 in Appendix N as follows:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3.10&blank;Gas- and Oil-Fueled Central Furnaces. After equilibrium conditions are achieved following the cool-down
test and the required measurements performed, turn on the furnace and measure the flue gas temperature, using the
thermocouple grid described above, at 0.5 and 2.5 minutes after the main burner(s) comes on. After the burner start-up,
delay the blower start-up by 1.5 minutes (t^) unless: (1) The furnace employs a single motor to drive the power burner
and the indoor air circulation blower, in which case the burner and blower shall be started together; or (2) the furnace
is designed to operate using an unvarying delay time that is other than 1.5 minutes, in which case the fan control shall
be permitted to start the blower; or (3) the delay time results in the activation of a temperature safety device which
shuts off the burner, in which case the fan control shall be permitted to start the blower. In the latter case, if the
fan control is adjustable, set it to start the blower at the highest temperature. If the fan control is permitted to
start the blower, measure time delay (t^) using a stop watch. Record the measured temperatures. During the heat-up
test for oil-fueled furnaces, maintain the draft in the flue pipe within

0.01 inch of water column of the manufacturer's recommended on-period draft.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This Interim Waiver is based upon the presumed validity of statements and all allegations submitted by the company.
This Interim Waiver may be removed or modified at any time upon a determination that the factual basis underlying the
application is incorrect.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Interim Waiver shall remain in effect for a period of 180 days or until DOE acts on the Petition for Waiver, whichever
is sooner, and may be extended for an additional 180-day period, if necessary.

Gentlemen: This is a Petition for Waiver and application of Interim Waiver submitted pursuant to Title 10 CFR 430.28.
Waiver is requested from the test procedure for measuring Furnace Energy Consumption as found in appendix H to subpart
B of part 430.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The current test requires a 1.5 minute delay between burner ignition and the start of the circulating air blower. Armstrong
Air Conditioning Inc. is requesting waiver and authorization to use a timed on delay instead of the specified 1.5 minutes
for blower start-up after main burner ignition. Armstrong intends to use a fixed timing control on our GUK and GCK condensing
gas furnaces and on our GUJ, GCJ, and GHJ non-condensing gas furnaces to gain additional energy savings that are achieved
with the use of shorter blower on times.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Test data for these furnaces with a timed on delay indicates an increase in AFUE. The use of a timed on delay reduces flue
losses thus increasing furnace efficiency. Copies of confidential test data confirming these energy savings will
be forwarded to you upon request.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The current test procedure does not give Armstrong credit for the energy savings that can be obtained using fixed timing.
ASHRAE 103&hyph;1993 test procedure that is under consideration by D.O.E. addresses the use of timed blower operation.
Section 9.6.1 of ASHRAE 103&hyph;1993 requires testing of a furnace with this type of control to be set to its maximum
setting. Armstrong's intent would be to request testing at this maximum setting. Granting of this Waiver permits
testing of similar competitive products to be rated on a comparable basis to that of Armstrong.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Armstrong is confident that this Waiver will be granted, and therefore requests an Interim Waiver be granted until
a final ruling is made. Armstrong, as well as other manufacturers of domestic furnaces, have been granted similar
waivers. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Manufacturers that domestically market similar products have been sent a copy of this Petition for Waiver and Application
for Interim Waiver.

Sir: Inadvertently in our Petition for Waiver and application for Interim Waiver, the delay on timing and the additional
increase in AFUE was left out. Our intent is to use a 30 second delay between burner ignition and the start of the circulating
air blower. An increase of 1.2 percentage points in AFUE can be achieved on the GUK and GCK condensing furnaces and an
increase of .8 percentage points on the GUJ, GCJ, and GHJ furnaces.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
The Energy Conservation Program for Consumer Products (other than automobiles) was established pursuant to the
Energy Policy and Conservation Act (EPCA), Public Law 94&hyph;163, 89 Stat. 917, as amended by the National Energy
Conservation Policy Act (NECPA), Public Law 95&hyph;619, 92 Stat. 3266, the National Appliance Energy Conservation
Act of 1987 (NAECA), Public Law 100&hyph;12, the National Appliance Energy Conservation Amendments of 1988 (NAECA
1988), Public Law 100&hyph;357, and the Energy Policy Act of 1992 (EPAct), Public Law 102&hyph;486, 106 Stat. 2776,
which requires DOE to prescribe standardized test procedures to measure the energy consumption of certain consumer
products, including furnaces. The intent of the test procedures is to provide a comparable measure of energy consumption
that will assist consumers in making purchasing decisions. These test procedures appear at 10 CFR part 430, subpart
B. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Department amended the prescribed test procedures by adding 10 CFR 430.27 on September 26, 1980, creating the
waiver process. 45 FR 64108. Thereafter, DOE further amended the appliance test procedure waiver process to allow
the Assistant Secretary for Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy (Assistant Secretary) to grant an Interim Waiver
from test procedure requirements to manufacturers that have petitioned DOE for a waiver of such prescribed test procedures.
51 FR 42823, November 26, 1986. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The waiver process allows the Assistant Secretary to waive temporarily, test procedures for a particular basic model
when a petitioner shows that the basic model contains one or more design characteristics which prevent testing according
to the prescribed test procedures, or when the prescribed test procedures may evaluate the basic model in a manner
so unrepresentative of its true energy consumption as to provide materially inaccurate comparative data. Waivers
generally remain in effect until final test procedure amendments become effective, resolving the problem that is
the subject of the waiver. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Interim Waiver provisions added by the 1986 amendment allow the Secretary to grant an Interim Waiver when it is
determined that the applicant will experience economic hardship if the Application for Interim Waiver is denied,
if it appears likely that the Petition for Waiver will be granted, and/or the Assistant Secretary determines that
it would be desirable for public policy reasons to grant immediate relief pending a determination on the Petition
for Waiver. An Interim Waiver remains in effect for a period of 180 days or until DOE issues its determination on the
Petition for Waiver, whichever is sooner, and may be extended for an additional 180 days, if necessary. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On March 4, 1994, DMO filed an Application for Interim Waiver regarding blower time delay. DMO's Application seeks
an Interim Waiver from the DOE test provisions that require a 1.5-minute time delay between the ignition of the burner
and starting of the circulating air blower. Instead, DMO requests the allowance to test using a 30-second blower time
delay when testing its HDS series gas furnaces. DMO states that the 30-second delay is indicative of how these furnaces
actually operate. Such a delay results in an increase in AFUE of 2.0 percentage points. Since current DOE test procedures
do not address this variable blower time delay, DMO asks that the Interim Waiver be granted. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department has published a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
August 23, 1993, (58 FR 44583) to amend the furnace test procedure, which addresses the above issue.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
DMO's Application for Interim Waiver does not provide sufficient information to evaluate what, if any, economic
impact or competitive disadvantage DMO will likely experience absent a favorable determination on its application.

However, in those instances where the likely success of the Petition for Waiver has been demonstrated, based upon
DOE having granted a waiver for a similar product design, it is in the public interest to have similar products tested
and rated for energy consumption on a comparable basis. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Therefore, DMO's Application for an Interim Waiver from the DOE test procedure for its HDS series gas furnaces regarding
blower time delay is granted. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
DMO shall be permitted to test its HDS series gas furnaces on the basis of the test procedures specified in 10 CFR Part
430, Subpart B, Appendix N, with the modification set forth below: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) Section 3.0 in Appendix N is deleted and replaced with the following paragraph: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3.0&blank;Test Procedure. Testing and measurements shall be as specified in Section 9 in ANSI/ASHRAE 103&hyph;82
with the exception of Sections 9.2.2, 9.3.1, and 9.3.2, and the inclusion of the following additional procedures:

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) Add a new paragraph 3.10 in Appendix N as follows: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3.10&blank;Gas- and Oil-Fueled Central Furnaces. After equilibrium conditions are achieved following the cool-down
test and the required measurements performed, turn on the furnace and measure the flue gas temperature, using the
thermocouple grid described above, at 0.5 and 2.5 minutes after the main burner(s) comes on. After the burner start-up,
delay the blower start-up by 1.5 minutes (t-) unless: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) The furnace employs a single motor to drive the power burner and the indoor air circulation blower, in which case
the burner and blower shall be started together; or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) The furnace is designed to operate using an unvarying delay time that is other than 1.5 minutes, in which case the
fan control shall be permitted to start the blower; or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) The delay time results in the activation of a temperature safety device which shuts off the burner, in which case
the fan control shall be permitted to start the blower. In the latter case, if the fan control is adjustable, set it to
start the blower at the highest temperature. If the fan control is permitted to start the blower, measure time delay
(t-) using a stop watch. Record the measured temperatures. During the heat-up test for oil-fueled furnaces, maintain
the draft in the flue pipe within 0.01 inch of water column of the manufacturer's recommended on-period draft. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This Interim Waiver is based upon the presumed validity of statements and all allegations submitted by the company.
This Interim Waiver may be removed or modified at any time upon a determination that the factual basis underlying the
application is incorrect. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Interim Waiver shall remain in effect for a period of 180 days or until DOE acts on the Petition for Waiver, whichever
is sooner, and may be extended for an additional 180-day period, if necessary.

Dear Secretary: Please consider this letter as a Petition for Waiver and Application for Interim Waiver, submitted
pursuant to Title 10 CFR 430.27. DMO Industries is requesting a waiver from the furnace test procedure which requires
a 90 second delay between burner ignition and blower start-up.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
DMO requests authorization to reduce the 90 second delay to 30 seconds when testing our HDS series, high efficiency,
residential gas furnaces. The HDS series includes the following models as listed in the GAMA (Gas Appliance Manufacturers
Association) certification program:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
DMO is currently switching all controls on this series to a 30 second blower-on delay by a timed controller, which cannot
be adjusted by the installer, or service person.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Our tests indicate that by using the 30 second delay, AFUE values increase by up to 2.0 points, depending on the model.
We feel that this is a substantial benefit to our customers and would like to reflect this through the higher AFUE values.
Confidential Test data is available upon request which confirms the above claim.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
We are confident that both an Interim Waiver and final Waiver will be granted us on the basis that many similar petitions
have already been granted on our competitors.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A copy of this petition for Waiver and Application for Interim Waiver is being sent to manufacturers who market similar
equipment.

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 Today's notice publishes a letter granting an Interim Waiver to Rheem Manufacturing Company (Rheem) from the existing
Department of Energy (DOE) test procedure regarding blower time delay for the company's GDG upflow, GLH downflow,
GVH horizontal, and GPH upflow/horizontal gas furnaces.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Today's notice also publishes a ``Petition for Waiver'' from Rheem. Rheem's Petition for Waiver requests DOE to grant
relief from the DOE furnace test procedure relating to the blower time delay specification. Rheem seeks to test using
a blower delay time of 20 seconds for its GDG upflow, GLH downflow, GVH horizontal, and GPH upflow/horizontal gas furnaces
instead of the specified 1.5-minute delay between burner on-time and blower on-time. The Department is soliciting
comments, data, and information respecting the Petition for Waiver.

The Department amended the prescribed test procedures by adding 10 CFR 430.27 on September 26, 1980, creating the
waiver process. 45 FR 64108. Thereafter, DOE further amended the appliance test procedure waiver process to allow
the Assistant Secretary for Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy (Assistant Secretary) to grant an Interim Waiver
from test procedure requirements to manufacturers that have petitioned DOE for a waiver of such prescribed test procedures.
51 FR 42823, November 26, 1986.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The waiver process allows the Assistant Secretary to waive temporarily, test procedures for a particular basic model
when a petitioner shows that the basic model contains one or more design characteristics which prevent testing according
to the prescribed test procedures, or when the prescribed test procedures may evaluate the basic model in a manner
so unrepresentative of its true energy consumption as to provide materially inaccurate comparative data. Waivers
generally remain in effect until final test procedure amendments become effective, resolving the problem that is
the subject of the waiver.

The Interim Waiver provisions added by the 1986 amendment allow the Secretary to grant an Interim Waiver when it is
determined that the applicant will experience economic hardship if the Application for Interim Waiver is denied,
if it appears likely that the Petition for Waiver will be granted, and/or the Assistant Secretary determines that
it would be desirable for public policy reasons to grant immediate relief pending a determination on the Petition
for Waiver. An Interim Waiver remains in effect for a period of 180 days or until DOE issues its determination on the
Petition for Waiver, whichever is sooner, and may be extended for an additional 180 days, if necessary.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On March 23, 1994, Rheem filed an Application for Interim Waiver regarding blower time delay. Rheem's Application
seeks an Interim Waiver from the DOE test provisions that require a 1.5-minute time delay between the ignition of the
burner and starting of the circulating air blower. Instead, Rheem requests the allowance to test using a 20-second
blower time delay when testing its GDG upflow, GLH downflow, GVH horizontal, and GPH upflow/horizontal gas furnaces.
Rheem states that the 20-second delay is indicative of how these furnaces actually operate. Such a delay results in
an average increase in AFUE of 2.0 percentage points. Since current DOE test procedures do not address this variable
blower time delay, Rheem asks that the Interim Waiver be granted.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department has published a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
August 23, 1993, (58 FR 44583) to amend the furnace test procedure, which addresses the above issue.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Previous waivers for this type of time blower delay control have been granted by DOE to Coleman Company, 50 FR 2710,
January 18, 1985; Magic Chef Company, 50 FR 41553, October 11, 1985; Rheem Manufacturing Company, 53 FR 48574, December

likely that the Petition for Waiver will be granted for blower time delay.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In those instances where the likely success of the Petition for Waiver has been demonstrated based upon DOE having
granted a waiver for a similar product design, it is in the public interest to have similar products tested and rated

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Therefore, based on the above, DOE is granting Rheem an Interim Waiver for its GDG upflow, GLH downflow, GVH horizontal,
and GPH upflow/horizontal gas furnaces. Pursuant to paragraph (e) of &sect;430.27 of the Code of Federal Regulations
part 430, the following letter granting the Application for Interim Waiver to Rheem was issued.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Pursuant to paragraph (b) of 10 CFR 430.27, DOE is hereby publishing the ``Petition for Waiver'' in its entirety. The
petition contains no confidential information. The Department solicits comments, data, and information respecting
the petition.

Dear Mr. Canclini: This is in response to your March 23, 1994, Application for Interim Waiver and Petition for Waiver
from the Department of Energy (DOE) test procedure regarding blower time delay for Rheem Manufacturing Company (Rheem)
GDG upflow, GLH downflow, GVH horizontal, and GPH upflow/horizontal gas furnaces.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
November 12, 1992. Thus, it appears likely that the Petition for Waiver will be granted for blower time delay. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Rheem's Application for Interim Waiver does not provide sufficient information to evaluate what, if any, economic
impact or competitive disadvantage Rheem will likely experience absent a favorable determination on its application.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
However, in those instances where the likely success of the Petition for Waiver has been demonstrated, based upon
DOE having granted a waiver for a similar product design, it is in the public interest to have similar products tested
and rated for energy consumption on a comparable basis. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Therefore, Rheem's Application for an Interim Waiver from the DOE test procedure for its GDG upflow, GLH downflow,
GVH horizontal, and GPH upflow/horizontal gas furnaces regarding blower time delay is granted. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Rheem shall be permitted to test its GDG upflow, GLH downflow, GVH horizontal, and GPH upflow/horizontal gas furnaces
on the basis of the test procedures specified in 10 CFR part 430, subpart B, Appendix N, with the modification set forth
below: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) Section 3.0 in Appendix N is deleted and replaced with the following paragraph: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3.0&blank;Test Procedure. Testing and measurements shall be as specified in Section 9 in ANSI/ASHRAE 103&hyph;82
with the exception of Sections 9.2.2, 9.3.1, and 9.3.2, and the inclusion of the following additional procedures:

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) Add a new paragraph 3.10 in Appendix N as follows: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3.10&blank;Gas- and Oil-Fueled Central Furnaces. After equilibrium conditions are achieved following the cool-down
test and the required measurements performed, turn on the furnace and measure the flue gas temperature, using the
thermocouple grid described above, at 0.5 and 2.5 minutes after the main burner(s) comes on. After the burner start-up,
delay the blower start-up by 1.5 minutes (t-) unless: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) The furnace employs a single motor to drive the power burner and the indoor air circulation blower, in which case
the burner and blower shall be started together; or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) The furnace is designed to operate using an unvarying delay time that is other than 1.5 minutes, in which case the
fan control shall be permitted to start the blower; or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) The delay time results in the activation of a temperature safety device which shuts off the burner, in which case
the fan control shall be permitted to start the blower. In the latter case, if the fan control is adjustable, set it to
start the blower at the highest temperature. If the fan control is permitted to start the blower, measure time delay
(t-) using a stop watch. Record the measured temperatures. During the heat-up test for oil-fueled furnaces, maintain
the draft in the flue pipe within

This Interim Waiver is based upon the presumed validity of statements and all allegations submitted by the company.
This Interim Waiver may be removed or modified at any time upon a determination that the factual basis underlying the
application is incorrect. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Interim Waiver shall remain in effect for a period of 180 days or until DOE acts on the Petition for Waiver, whichever
is sooner, and may be extended for an additional 180-day period, if necessary.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
Dear Mr. Nasseri: This is a petition for waiver and application for interim waiver submitted pursuant to title 10 CFR
430.27. Waiver is requested from the furnace test procedure as prescribed in appendix N to Subpart B of Part 430. The
test procedure requires a 1.5 minute delay between burner and blower start-up. Rheem is requesting authorization
to use a 20 second delay instead of 1.5 minutes for our series (^)GDG upflow, (^)GLH downflow, (^)GVH horizontal, and
(^)GPH upflow/horizontal residential gas-fired furnaces.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Rheem will be manufacturing these appliances with an electronic device that controls the blower operation on a timing
sequence as opposed to temperature.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Improved energy efficiency is achieved by reducing on cycle losses. Under the Appendix N procedures, the stack temperature
is allowed to climb at a faster rate than it would with a 20 second blower on time, allowing energy to be lost out of the
vent system. This waste of energy would not occur in actual operation. If this petition is granted, the true blower
on time delay would be used in the calculations.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The current test procedures do not give Rheem credit for the energy savings which averages approximately 2%. This
improvement is an average reduction of 20% of the normal on cycle energy losses. Rheem is of the opinion that a 20% reduction
is a worthwhile energy savings.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Rheem has been granted previous waivers regarding blower on time to be used in the efficiency calculations for our
(^)GEB and (^)GKA series condensing furnaces and/or (^)GDE, (^)GLE, (^)GDG, (^)GLG and (^)GVG series furnaces.
Several other manufacturers of gas furnaces have also been granted a waiver to permit calculations based on timed
blower operation. Also, ASHRAE Standard 103&hyph;1993, paragraph 9.5.1.2.2 specifically addresses the use of
timed blower operation.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Confidential and comparative test data is available to you upon your request, confirming the above energy savings.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Manufacturers that domestically market similar products are being sent a copy of this petition for waiver and petition
for interim waiver.

<SUMMARY>
<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 -->
SUMMARY: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
In accordance with the authorities contained in 12 U.S.C. 1821(c), the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC)
was duly appointed receiver for each of the financial institutions specified in 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 -->
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
. The FDIC has determined that the proceeds which can be realized from the liquidation of the assets of the below listed
receivership estates are insufficient to wholly satisfy the priority claims of depositors against the receivership
estates. Therefore, upon satisfaction of secured claims, depositor claims and claims which have priority over depositors
under applicable law, no amount will remain or will be recovered sufficient to allow a dividend, distribution or payment
to any creditor of lessor priority, including but not limited to, claims of general creditors. Any such claims are
hereby determined to be worthless.

any questions of fact that are in dispute, summarizing the evidence that would be presented at a hearing, and indicating

conflicts of interests, or unsound banking practices.'' Any request for a hearing on this question must be accompanied

Supplementary Information: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
The aim of the proposal to redesign the disability claims process is to achieve dramatically improved levels of service
to the public. For purposes of this initiative, the process considered begins with the initial contact of the claimant
when an intent to file an application for disability benefits is expressed, and continues through the payment of benefits
or the final administrative appeal. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposed redesigned process is characterized by opportunities for claimants to participate fully throughout
the process, enabled by information about the process and personal contact with a single employee during the initial
claims process. The appeals process is streamlined, with more efficient management of pre-hearing development
and an opportunity for claimants to receive favorable decisions without a hearing if the evidence so warrants, or
faster decisions if a hearing is held. The decision methodology used at all levels would be simplified and streamlined
to be more understandable by lay persons and medical persons alike, and there is an emphasis on individualized functional
assessment. Employees work in an atmosphere characterized by teamwork, contributions by claimants and interested
third parties, adequate training and quality feedback, and technological supports. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Team's proposal intends to make the process more efficient and customer friendly for all claimants for Social
Security or Supplemental Security Income disability benefits; to give claimants the right decision at the earliest
point possible in the process. It is the Team's intention that claims for benefits which are correctly paid today will
continue to be paid, but in a more expedited manner. The Team's proposal is not intended to affect the benefits of current
disability beneficiaries, to reduce the percentage of cases that are allowed under the current process, or to make
it more difficult for an individual to be found disabled. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Disability Process Reengineering Team is interested in receiving public comments on the concepts in the proposal,
particularly the public's response to the following questions about the proposal's goals: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Does the proposal have the potential to provide a process that is easy for claimants and those who assist claimants
to access and understand? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Will it enable SSA and the State DDS to make the right decision the first time a case is adjudicated? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Will it result in dramatically improved processing times? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Will it result in a more efficient use of SSA and State DDS personnel? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Will it create jobs for employees in the process that are satisfying? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In considering these questions, interested parties are encouraged to identify factors that would assure that the
proposed concepts will achieve these goals. To the extent that the proposal is not seen as achieving these goals, alternative
suggestions about how to do so are of particular interest to the Team. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Commissioner of Social Security or her designee will preside over the public meeting and chair a panel including
members of the Disability Process Reengineering Team. The meeting will be open to the public to the extent that space
is available. Individuals who would like to present comments to the panel should contact the Project Team at 410&hyph;966&hyph;8255
by COB 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
May 11, 1994 to sign up for a specific time for their presentations. Times for presentations will be scheduled on a first-come,
first-served basis. Time allowing, each presenter will be given 5 minutes to make a presentation to the panel. Participants
in this meeting are asked to submit 1 written copy of their full presentation on the day of the public meeting and be prepared
to give an abbreviated statement at the public meeting. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
While we will try to provide all interested parties with an opportunity to present comments to the panel, individuals
who do not pre-register to make a presentation may not be able to be accommodated within the three hours reserved for
the meeting. In such cases, written statements may be submitted on the day of the public meeting. A sign language interpreter
will be available; the room is accessible for wheelchairs.

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Department of Health and Human Services notifies Federal agencies of the laboratories currently certified to
meet standards of Subpart C of Mandatory Guidelines for Federal Workplace Drug Testing Programs (53 FR 11979, 11986).
A similar notice listing all currently certified laboratories will be published during the first week of each month,
and updated to include laboratories which subsequently apply for and complete the certification process. If any
listed laboratory's certification is totally suspended or revoked, the laboratory will be omitted from updated
lists until such time as it is restored to full certification under the Guidelines. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
If any laboratory has withdrawn from the National Laboratory Certification Program during the past month, it will
be identified as such at the end of the current list of certified laboratories, and will be omitted from the monthly
listing thereafter.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 Mandatory Guidelines for Federal Workplace Drug Testing were developed in accordance with Executive Order 12564
and section 503 of Public Law 100&hyph;71. Subpart C of the Guidelines, ``Certification of Laboratories Engaged
in Urine Drug Testing for Federal Agencies,'' sets strict standards which laboratories must meet in order to conduct
urine drug testing for Federal agencies. To become certified an applicant laboratory must undergo three rounds of
performance testing plus an on-site inspection. To maintain that certification a laboratory must participate in
an every-other-month performance testing program plus periodic, on-site inspections. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Laboratories which claim to be in the applicant stage of certification are 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
not 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
to be considered as meeting the minimum requirements expressed in the HHS Guidelines. A laboratory must have its letter
of certification from SAMHSA, HHS (formerly: HHS/NIDA) which attests that it has met minimum standards. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In accordance with Subpart C of the Guidelines, the following laboratories meet the minimum standards set forth in
the Guidelines:

The purpose of this exchange is to dispose of public lands that have no legal access, limited resource values, are difficult
and uneconomic to manage, and would better be managed in private ownership, in exchange for private lands that contain
important wildlife, riparian, and recreation values in Hulls Gulch and along the Bruneau River Canyon. The public
interest will be well served by the completion of this exchange, as the consummation thereof will fulfill the Secretary's
Fish and Wildlife 2000, Recreation 2000, and riparian management initiatives.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The values of the lands to be exchanged are approximately equal. Full equalization of values will be accomplished
prior to closing through either acreage adjustment or cash payment in an amount not to exceed 25 percent of the value
of the lands to be transferred out of Federal ownership.

SUMMARY: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
The United States Geological Survey (USGS) is planning to enter a cooperative research and development agreement
with several major oil companies. The purpose of the CRADA is to conduct geological field studies on Devonian and Carboniferous
carbonate reefs and carbonate platforms in Kazakhstan that will lead to the development of predictive petroleum-focused
models that can serve as useful analogs for interpreting the subsurface nature of facies belts, stratigraphic cyclicity,
and distribution of potential reservoir, seal, and source-rock facies in the North Caspian basin and in other carbonate
basins of the former Soviet Union.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

Any other oil companies or organizations interested in pursuing the possibility of a CRADA for similar kinds of activities
should contact the USGS.

 Annually, approximately 1,200 individuals have contact with the Minerals Management Service Gulf of Mexico Public
Information Office by mail, telephone or in person. The Public Information Office provides its customers with information
regarding the gas, oil, and sulphur leasing, exploration and production activities regulated by MMS in federally
owned areas in the Gulf. The collection will obtain information for determining the level of satisfaction with the
service provided by the Public Information Office to these individuals and to identify any areas where improvements
in providing service could be made

Purpose of Call.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The purpose of the Call is to gather information for OCS Lease Sale 157 in the Central Gulf of Mexico Planning Area, tentatively
scheduled for March 1995, and OCS Lease Sale 161 in the Western Gulf of Mexico Planning Area, tentatively scheduled
for August 1995. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Information and nominations on gas and oil leasing, exploration, and development and production within the Central
and Western Gulf of Mexico Planning Areas are sought from all interested parties. This early planning and consultation
step is important for ensuring that all interests and concerns are communicated to the Department of the Interior
for future decisions in the leasing process pursuant to the OCSLA, and regulations at 30 CFR part 256. This Call does
not indicate a preliminary decision to lease in the area described below. Final delineation of the area for possible
leasing will be made at a later date and in compliance with applicable laws including all requirements of the NEPA,
and the OCSLA. Established departmental procedures will be employed.

Description of Area.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The general area of this Call covers the entire central and western portions of the Gulf of Mexico between approximately
88 degrees W. longitude on the east and approximately 97 degrees W. longitude on the west and extends from the Federal-State
boundaries seaward to the provisional maritime boundary between the United States and Mexico. The entire Call area
is offshore the States of Texas, Louisiana, Mississippi, and Alabama. This area is divided into two planning areas.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Central Gulf Planning Area is bounded on the east by approximately 88 degrees W. longitude. Its western boundary
begins at the offshore boundary between Texas and Louisiana and proceeds southeasterly to approximately 28 degrees
N. latitude, thence east to approximately 92 degrees W. longitude, thence south to the provisional maritime boundary
with Mexico which constitutes the southern boundary of the area. The northern part of the area is bounded by the Federal-State
boundary offshore Louisiana, Mississippi, and Alabama. The area available for nominations and comments consists
of about 47.8 million acres. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Western Gulf Planning Area is bounded on the west and north by the Federal-State boundary and on the east by the Central
Gulf Planning Area. It extends south to the provisional maritime boundary with Mexico. It is offshore Texas and, in
deeper water, offshore Louisiana. The area available for nominations and comments consists of about 35.9 million
acres. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A standard Call for Information Map depicting each planning area on a block-by-block basis is available without charge
from: Minerals Management Service, Public Information Unit (MS 5034), 1201 Elmwood Park Boulevard, New Orleans,

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The standard Call for Information Map delineates the Call area, all of which has been identified by the MMS as having
potential for the discovery of accumulations of gas and oil. Respondents are requested to indicate interest in and
comment on any or all of the Federal acreage within the boundaries of the Call area that they wish to have considered
for inclusion in proposed Sale 157 in the Central Gulf and proposed Sale 161 in the Western Gulf. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Although individual indications of interest are considered to be privileged and proprietary information, the names
of persons or entities indicating interest or submitting comments will be of public record. Those indicating such
interest are requested to do so on the standard Call for Information Map by outlining the areas of interest along block
lines. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Respondents should rank areas in which they have expressed interest according to priority of their interest (e.g.,
priority 1 (high), 2 (medium), or 3 (low)). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Respondents are encouraged to be specific in indicating blocks by priority, as blanket 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
nominations on large areas are not useful in the analysis of industry interest. Areas where interest has been indicated
but on which respondents have not indicated priorities will be considered priority 3 (low). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Respondents may also submit a detailed list of blocks nominated (by Official Protraction Diagram and Leasing Map
designations) to ensure correct interpretation of their nominations. Specific questions may be directed to the
Chief, Leasing Activities Section at (504) 736&hyph;2761. Official Protraction Diagrams and Leasing Maps can be
purchased from the Public Information Unit referred to above. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Comments are sought from all interested parties about particular geological, environmental, biological, archaeological,
and socioeconomic conditions or conflicts, or other information that might bear upon the potential leasing and development
of particular areas. Comments are also sought on possible conflicts between future OCS gas and oil activities that
may result from the proposed sales and State Coastal Management Programs (CMP's). If possible, these comments should
identify specific CMP policies of concern, the nature of the conflict foreseen, and steps that the MMS could take to
avoid or mitigate the potential conflict. Comments may either be in terms of broad areas or restricted to particular
blocks of concern. Those submitting comments are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requested to list block numbers or outline the subject area on the standard Call for Information Map. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Use of Information from Call.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Information submitted in response to this Call will be used for several purposes. First, responses will be used to
help identify the areas of potential for gas and oil development. Second, comments on possible environmental effects
and potential use conflicts will be used in the analysis of environmental conditions in and near the Call area. This
information will be used to make a preliminary determination of the potential advantages and disadvantages of gas
and oil exploration and development to the region and the Nation. A third purpose of this Call is to use the comments
collected to initiate the scoping process for the Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) and to develop a proposed
action and alternatives. Fourth, comments may be used in developing lease terms and conditions to ensure safe offshore
operations. Fifth, comments may be used to assess potential conflicts between offshore gas and oil activities and
a State CMP.

Existing Information.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Preceding this Call in the sale planning process was an Information Base Review (IBR). The purpose of an IBR is to evaluate
the status of pertinent information and the information acquisition efforts. This IBR constituted an assessment
of the quality and adequacy of the information available which has been found sufficient for the decision to proceed
with the Call.

Purpose of Notice of Intent (NOI). 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Pursuant to the regulations implementing the provisions of the NEPA, the MMS is announcing its intent to prepare an
EIS on the gas and oil leasing proposals known as Sale 157 in the Central Gulf, and Sale 161 in the Western Gulf, off the
States of Texas, Louisiana, Mississippi, and Alabama. The NOI also serves to announce the scoping process that will
be followed for this EIS. Throughout the scoping process, Federal Agencies and State and local governments and other
interested parties have the opportunity to aid the MMS in determining the significant issues and alternatives to
be analyzed in the EIS. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The EIS analysis will focus on the potential environmental effects of leasing, exploration, and development of the
blocks included in the areas defined in the Area Identification procedure as the proposed areas of the Federal actions.
Alternatives to the proposal which may be considered for each sale are to delay the sale, cancel the sale, or modify
the sale.

in Chile. At this time, the Ministry of Finance of the Republic of Chile has authorized USAID to request proposals from
eligible lenders for a loan under this program of $10 Million U.S. Dollars (US$10,000,000). The name and address of
the Borrower's representatives to be contacted by interested U.S. lenders or investment bankers, the amount of the

foreign partnerships or associations wholly owned by U.S. citizens.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
To be eligible for the USAID guaranty, the loans must be repayable in full no later than the thirtieth anniversary of
the disbursement of the principal amount thereof and the interest rates may be no higher than the maximum rate established
from time to time by USAID.

 On December 8, 1993, the Commission instituted the subject investigation and established a schedule for its conduct
(59 FR 3735, January 26, 1994). Subsequently, the President declared April 27, 1994, a day of national mourning and
ordered all Federal agencies closed for business. The Commission, therefore, is revising its schedule in the investigation
to adjust for the President's order. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Commission's new schedule for the investigation is as follows: the hearing will be held at the U.S. International
Trade Commission Building at 9:30 a.m. on May 2, 1994; the deadline for filing posthearing briefs is May 9, 1994.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
On April 5, 1994, the workers with the support of their Congressman, requested administrative reconsideration of
the Department's denial notice for workers at the subject firm. The notice was issued on March 15, 1994 and was published
in the Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 on March 30, 1994 (59 FR 14876).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
It's claimed that an appropriate subdivision at Johnson Controls in Bennington, Vermont was adversely affected
by increased imports because Johnson Controls moved a part of the production process (the filling, charging, decorating
and installing) at Bennington to a plant in Mexico. The charged batteries will then reenter the U.S. as imports.

After careful review of the application, I conclude that the claim is of sufficient weight to justify reconsideration
of the Department of Labor's prior decision. The application is, therefore, granted.

<DOCTITLE>Investigations Regarding Certifications of Eligibility To Apply for NAFTA Transitional Adjustment Assistance</DOCTITLE>
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Petitions for transitional adjustment assistance under the North American Free Trade Agreement-Transitional
Adjustment Assistance Implementation Act (Pub. L. 103&hyph;182), hereinafter called (NAFTA&hyph;TAA), have
been filed with State Governors under Section 250(a) of Subchapter D, Chapter 2, Title II, of the Trade Act of 1974,
as amended, are identified in the Appendix to this Notice. Upon notice from a Governor that a NAFTA&hyph;TAA petition
has been received, the Director of the Office of Trade Adjustment Assistance (OTAA), Employment and Training Administration
(ETA), Department of Labor (DOL), announces the filing of the petition and takes actions pursuant to paragraphs (c)
and (e) of Section 250 of the Trade Act.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The purpose of the Governor's actions and the Labor Department's investigations are to determine whether the workers
separated from employment after December 8, 1993 (date of enactment of Public Law 103&hyph;182) are eligible to apply
for NAFTA&hyph;TAA under Subchapter D of the Trade Act because of increased imports from or the shift in production
to Mexico or Canada.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The petitioners or any other persons showing a substantial interest in the subject matter of the investigations may
request a public hearing with the Director of OTAA at the U.S. Department of Labor (DOL) in Washington, DC, provided
such request is filed in writing with the Director of OTAA not later than May 13, 1994.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
In accordance with Section 6(b)(5) of the Wagner-Peyser Act, the Employment and Training Administration is publishing
final planning allotments for each State for Program Year (PY) 1994 (July 1, 1994, through June 30, 1995). Preliminary
planning estimates were provided to each State on February 25, 1994. Funds are distributed in accordance with formula
criteria established in Section 6 (a) and (b) of the Wagner-Peyser Act. Civilian labor force (CLF) and unemployment
data for Calendar Year 1993 are used in making the formula calculations.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The total amount of funds currently available for distribution is $832,856,000. The Secretary of Labor set aside
3 percent of the total available funds to assure that each State will have sufficient resources to maintain statewide
employment services, as required by Section 6(b)(4) of the Act. In accordance with this provision, $24,396,018 is
set aside for administrative formula allocation. These funds are included in the total planning allotment. The funds
that are set aside are distributed in two steps to States which have lost in relative share of resources from the prior
year. In Step 1, States which have a CLF below one million and are below the median CLF density are maintained at 100 percent
of their relative share of prior year resources. The remainder is distributed in Step 2 to all other States losing in
relative share from the prior year but which do not meet the size and density criteria for Step 1. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Postage costs incurred by States during the conduct of employment service (ES) activities are billed directly to
the Department of Labor by the U.S. Postal Service. The total final planning allotment reflects $19,655,400, or 2.36
percent of the total amount available, withheld from distribution to finance postage costs associated with the conduct
of ES business. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department had planned to require State Employment Security Agencies (SESAs) to convert from penalty mail systems
to commercial mail systems effective October 1, 1994, at which time the Employment and Training Administration (ETA)
had planned to allocate national postage reserves to the SESAs. Based on a legal opinion, the Department cannot require
this conversion. SESAs are entitled to the penalty mail privilege pursuant to 39 U.S.C. 3202(a)(1)(E). This does
not impact on the change to direct accountability that SESAs implemented on October 1, 1993. States will continue
to use penalty mail systems (penalty meters, penalty stamps and envelopes, permit G&hyph;12, and Business Reply
Mail permit 12634) and ETA will continue to pay the SESA penalty mail costs to the U.S. Postal Service. ETA will explore
with the U.S. Postal Service the possibility of having individual State penalty mail agreements with the U.S. Postal
Service. This would permit ETA to allocate postage resources to the States who could then have the option of using commercial
or penalty mail systems. It continues to the Departmental policy that States utilize commercial mail methods for
mail which pertains to both employment security and non-employment security business. In such instances, ETA will
reimburse the SESA for the employment security share of the cost. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Differences between preliminary planning estimates and final planning allotments are caused by the use of a Calendar
Year data base as opposed to the earlier data used for preliminary planning estimates. Ten percent of the total sums
allotted to each State shall be reserved for use by the Governor to provide performance incentives for public ES offices;
services for groups with special needs; and for the extra costs of exemplary models for delivering job services.

Identification of Proposed Action 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposed action would grant a one-time schedular exemption from the requirements of Appendix J, paragraphs III.D.2.(a)
and III.D.3 of 10 CFR part 50 and approve an extension of the 2-year period between the performance of Type B and C leak
rate test by 150 days. Appendix J to 10 CFR part 50, paragraph III.D.2.(a), states, in part, ``Type B tests, except tests
for air locks, shall be performed during reactor shutdown for refueling, or other convenient intervals, but in no
case at intervals greater than 2 years.'' Paragraph III.D.3., states, ``Type C tests shall be performed during each
reactor shutdown for refueling but in no case at intervals greater than 2 years.'' Taken together, these sections
require Type B and C containment leakage tests to be performed at an interval not to exceed 2 years. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In a letter dated March 9, 1994, as supplemental April 13, 1994, the licensee requested an exemption to 10 CFR part 50,
Appendix J, to allow the time between the performance of the required Type B and C tests to exceed the 2-year maximum
by up to 150 days. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
The Need for the Proposed Action 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposed exemption is needed because compliance with paragraphs III.D.2(a) and III.D.3 of 10 CFR part 50, appendix
J, would result in a unit shutdown and additional personnel radiation exposure in order to comply with the required
Type B and C test frequency. The licensee last conducted the required Type B and C leak rate tests during a refueling
outage in the spring of 1992. These previous leak rate tests will reach the 2-year maximum test interval imposed by
Appendix J starting on May 29, 1994. The licensee's next refueling outage is scheduled to begin in August 1994. The
extended interval between refueling outages is a result of an equipment problem and scheduling to avoid coincident
refueling outages on both units. The exemption is requested to support the current outage schedule and to avoid the
potential for an earlier reactor shutdown. If a forced outage is imposed to perform testing it would present undue
hardship and cost in the form of increased radiological exposure. Furthermore, if a forced outage is imposed to perform
the required testing, an additional plant shutdown and startup will be required. This action is similar to that approved
for several other facilities.

Environmental Impact of the Proposed Action 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposed action includes exemptions from performing Type B and C tests for a maximum period of 150 days beyond the
required Appendix J test intervals. As stated in 10 CFR part 50, appendix J, the purpose of the primary containment
leak rate testing requirements is to ensure that leakage rates are maintained within the Technical Specification
requirements and to assure that proper maintenance and repair is performed throughout the service life of the containment
boundary components. The requested exemption is consistent with the intent of 10 CFR 50.12(a), in that it represents
a one-time only schedular extension of short duration. The required leak tests will still be performed to assess compliance
with Technical Specification requirements, albeit later, and to asure that any required maintenance or repair is
performed. As noted in paragraphs III.D.2.(a) and III.D.3 of Appendix J, it was intended that the testing be performed
during refueling outages or other convenient intervals. Extending the Appendix J intervals by a small amount to reach
the next refueling outage will not significantly impact the integrity of the containment boundary and, therefore,
will not significantly impact the consequences of an accident or transient in the unlikely event of such an occurance
during the 150-day extended period. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Past Unit 2 local leak rate test data have demonstrated improving leak rate test results. Although the As Found results
for the 1989 and 1990 outages were 3.0 L

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
a
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, followed several corrective actions by the licensee. The improving trend for the Type B and C testing, well below
the allowable limit, provides reasonable assurance that the probability of exceeding the offsite dose rates established
in 10 part 100 will not be increased by extending the current Type B and C testing for a maximum of 150 days.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Thus, radiological releases will not differ from those determined previously and the proposed exemption does not
otherwise affect facility radiological effluent or occupational exposures. The proposed exemption will not increase
the probability or consequences of any reactor accidents. The proposed exemption does not affect plant nonradiological
effluents and has no other environmental impact. Therefore, the Commission concludes that there are no measurable
radiological or nonradiological environmental impacts associated with the proposed exemption.

Alternatives to the Proposed Action
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Since the Commission concluded that there are no significant environmental effects that would result from the proposed
action, any alternatives with equal or greater environmental impacts need not be evaluated.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The principal alternative would be to deny the requested exemption and amendment and to require rigid compliance
with the requirements of paragraphs III.D.2.(a) and III.D.3 of appendix J to 10 CFR part 50. Such action would not enhance
the protection of the environment and would result in unjustified burdens and costs for the licensee and greater occupational
exposure to plant personnel.

The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (the Commission) is considering issuance of amendments to Facility Operating
Licenses No. DPR&hyph;70 and DPR&hyph;75, issued to Public Service Electric and Gas Company (the licensee), for
the operation of Salem Nuclear Generating Station, Units 1 and 2.

Identification of Proposed Action
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The amendments would consist of changes to the Technical Specifications (TS) that would authorize an increase to
the storage capacity of the spent fuel pools (SFP) from 1170 fuel assemblies to 1632 fuel assemblies at each Salem unit.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The amendments to the TS are responsive to the licensee's application dated April 28, 1993, as supplemented by letters
of August 12, 1993, November 7, 1993, February 2, 1994, and April 7, 1994. The NRC staff has prepared an Environmental
Assessment of the proposed action, ``Environmental Assessment by the Office of Nuclear Reactor Regulation Relating
to the Expansion of the Spent Fuel Pools, Public Service Electric and Gas Company, Facility Operating License No.
DPR&hyph;70 and DPR&hyph;75, Salem Nuclear Generating Station, Units 1 and 2, Docket Nos. 50&hyph;272 and 50&hyph;311,''
dated April 25, 1994.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
Summary of Environmental Assessment
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The ``Final Generic Environmental Impact Statement (FGEIS) on Handling and Storage of Spent Light Water Power Reactor
Fuel'' (NUREG&hyph;0575), concluded that the environmental impact of interim storage of spent fuel was negligible
and the cost of the various alternatives reflects the advantage of continued generation of nuclear with the accompanying
spent fuel storage. Because of the differences in SFP designs, the FGEIS recommended licensing SFP expansion on a
case-by-case basis.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For Salem Units 1 and 2, the SFP modification will not create any significant additional radiological effects or measurable
nonradiological environmental impacts.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In the event of a fuel handling accident, the whole body dose and thyroid dose that might be received by an individual
at the site boundary is well within regulatory requirements. It is not expected that an increase in the occupational
radiation dose will result from the operation of the expanded spent fuel pools. For the modification of the pools,
the occupational exposure is estimated to be less than 4% of the total annual occupational exposure at the facility.
To assure as low as reasonably achievable (ALARA) goals are met, during the SFP expansion activities, work, personnel
traffic and movement of equipment will be monitored and controlled. Therefore, the staff concludes that the exposure
to workers is ALARA and is acceptable.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The only nonradiological impact affected by the expansion of the spent fuel pools is the waste heat rejected. The increase
in total plant waste heat is insignificant (less than 0.05% of the total plant heat loss to the environment). There
is no significant environmental impact attributed to the waste heat from the plant because of the expansion of the
spent fuel pools.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
Finding of No Significant Impact
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The staff has reviewed this proposed facility modification relative to the requirements set forth in 10 CFR part 51.
Based on this assessment, the staff concludes that there are no significant radiological or nonradiological impacts
associated with the proposed action and that the issuance of the proposed amendments to the licenses will have no significant
impact on the quality of the human environment. Therefore, the Commission has determined, pursuant to 10 CFR 51.31,
not to prepare an environmental impact statement for the proposed amendments.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For further details with respect to this action, see (1) the application for amendments to the Technical Specifications
dated April 28, 1993, as supplemented by letters of August 12, 1993, November 17, 1993, February 2, 1994, and April
7, 1994, (2) the FGEIS on Handling and Storage of Spent Light Water Power Reactor Fuel (NUREG&hyph;0575), (3) the Final
Environmental Statement for Salem Nuclear Generating Station, Units 1 and 2, issued April 1973, and (4) the Environmental
Assessment dated April 25, 1994. These documents are available for public inspection at the Commission's Public
Document Room, the Gelman Building, 2120 L Street, NW., Washington, DC 20555, and at the local public document room

The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (the Commission) is considering issuance of an exemption from the requirements
of 10 CFR 140.11(a)(4) to Facility Operating License No. DPR&hyph;13, a possession-only license held by the Southern
California Edison Company (SCE or the licensee). The exemption would apply to the San Onofre Nuclear Generating Station,
Unit 1 (SONGS 1), a permanently shutdown plant located at the SCE site in San Diego County, California.

Identification of Proposed Action
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposed action would grant an exemption from the requirements of 10 CFR 140.11(a)(4) to the extent that SONGS
1 would be exempted from participation in the industry retrospective rating plan (secondary level financial protection).
The licensee requested the elimination of its required participation in a letter dated February 2, 1993.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
The Need for the Proposed Action
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
SONGS 1 was permanently shut down in November 1992, and defueling of the reactor completed in March 1993. Upon licensee
certification of the defueling on March 9, 1993, Amendment No. 150 to Facility Operating License No. DPR&hyph;13
became effective, changing the license to a possession-only license. The exemption addresses withdrawal from participation
in the industry retrospective rating plan.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Since SONGS 1 no longer contributes as great a risk to the retrospective rating plan participants as does an operating
plant, this reduction in risk should be reflected in the indemnification requirements to which the licensee is subject.
Approval of this request would allow a more equitable allocation of financial risk.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
Environmental Impact of the Proposed Action
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposed action does not involve any environmental impacts. The proposed exemption is in a subject area, changes
in surety, insurance and/or indemnity requirements, for which the Commission in 10 CFR 51.22(c)(10) has determined
that a license amendment would meet the criteria for categorical exclusion from the need for either an environmental
assessment or an environmental impact statement.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Since the proposed action does not involve a change in plant operation or configuration, there is reasonable assurance
that the proposed action would not increase the probability or the consequences of an accident or reduce the margin
of safety, no changes would be made in the types or quantities of effluents that may be released offsite, and there would
be no significant increase in the allowable individual or cumulative radiation exposure.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Accordingly, the Commission concludes that this proposed action would result in no significant radiological environmental
impact.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
With regard to potential non-radiological impacts, the proposed action does not affect non-radiological plant
effluents and has no other environmental impact. Therefore, the Commission concludes that there are no significant
non-radiological impacts associated with the proposed action.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
Alternatives to the Proposed Action
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Since the Commission has concluded that there are no measurable environmental impacts associated with the proposed
action, any alternative with equal or greater environmental impacts need not be evaluated.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The principal alternative would be to deny the action. This would not reduce environmental impacts of plant operation
and would not enhance the protection of the environment nor public health and safety.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
Alternative Use of Resources
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This action does not involve the use of resources not previously considered in the Environmental Assessment related
to the conversion of the Provisional Operating License to a Full Term Operating License issued to Southern California
Edison Company for the San Onofre Nuclear Generating Station, Unit 1, on September 16, 1991.

Detroit Edison Company (the licensee) is the holder of Facility Operating License No. NPF&hyph;43 which authorizes
operation of the Fermi 2 Nuclear Plant at steady-state reactor power levels not in excess of 3430 megawatts thermal.
The Fermi 2 facility is a boiling water reactor located at the licensee's site in Monroe County, Michigan. The license
provides, among other things, that it is subject to all rules, regulations, and Orders of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission
(the Commission) now or hereafter in effect.

Paragraph III.C of appendix J to 10 CFR part 50 requires, in part, that valves, unless pressurized with fluid (e.g.,
water, nitrogen) from a seal system, shall be tested by pressurizing with air or nitrogen at a test pressure of Pa (56.5
psig), the calculated peak containment internal pressure as a result of the design basis accident. Further, the combined
leakage rate of all penetrations and valves subject to Type B and C testing shall be less than 0.60 La (La is the maximum
allowable leakage rate at Pa). Leakage from containment isolation valves that are sealed with fluid from a seal system
may be excluded, provided the leakage rates for these valves do not exceed the Technical Specification leakage requirements
and the seal system fluid inventory is sufficient to ensure the sealing function for 30 days following an accident
at a pressure of 1.10 Pa.

Pursuant to 10 CFR 50.12(a), the NRC may grant exemptions from the requirements of the regulations (1) which are authorized
by law, will not present an undue risk to the public health and safety, and are consistent with the common defense and
security; and (2) where special circumstances are present.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
By letter dated May 24, 1993, the licensee requested an exemption from the requirements of 10 CFR part 50, appendix
J, III.C for performing Type C integrated leak rate tests of the containment isolation valves in the Low pressure coolant
injection (LPCI) lines of the residual heat removal (RHR) system. The valves in question are the loop A and B LPCI isolation
valves, which are motor-operated gate valves, outboard of containment and which are operable from the control room
and are designated as E11&hyph;F015 A and B. The licensee proposed, as alternative testing, an external leakage test,
with water as the test medium, at a pressure of 1045 psig with an allowable leakage value of 5 milliliters per minute
(ml/min). The license also provided justification in its May 24, 1993, letter to reclassify the inboard containment
LPCI valve configuration (which consists of a reverse flow swing check valve with a 1-inch, locked closed, solenoid-operated
bypass valve) as other than containment isolation valves and thus no longer subject to Type C testing.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The staff evaluated the licensee's proposal for reclassification of the inboard containment valves and concluded
that the licensee's proposal met the guidance in the Standard Review Plan (SRP), NUREG&hyph;0800, Section 6.2.4
for differing from the explicit requirements of General Design Criterion 55 in 10 CFR part 50, appendix A for containment
isolation valves (CIVs). Subsection II.6.e allows only a single CIV outside containment, if the system is closed
outside containment and certain other criteria are met. Details concerning the staff's review are contained in the
staff's safety evaluation dated April 22, 1994.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Two aspects of the RHR system form the basis for the proposed exemption. It is a closed system outside of containment,
and the containment penetrations will be water sealed during a loss of coolant accident (LOCA). The licensee's analyses
showed that a water seal. pressurized to greater than 1.1 Pa (62.15 psig), would exist outboard of the LPCI CIV for at
least 30 days following the design basis LOCA despite the most limiting single active failure. However, if one or both
of the LPCI CIVs is shut, that water seal might not prevent external valve leakage (valve stem or bonnet leakage). The
licensee also showed that a water seal, would exist inboard of the LPCI CIVs following a design basis LOCA. The licensee's
analyses demonstrated that the volume of the water seal is sufficient to last for greater than 30 days assuming the
leakage limit proposed in their alternative testing acceptance criteria. The licensee's analyses also showed that
through seat leakage of the LPCI CIVs would be in toward containment and would not deplete the water seal.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Although the external leakage water seal would prevent atmosphere from leading out of containment, it does not satisfy
the requirements for a water seal contained in Appendix J. Appendix J allows water sealed valves to be excepted from
the normal Type C testing with air, but it requires that the water seal be pressurized to at least 1.1 Pa during an accident.
The water leg inboard of the LPCI CIVs does not meet this requirement. Nevertheless, the staff has determined that
the licensee's analyses of the water seals provide sufficient assurance that containment atmosphere leakage out
of containment will be prevented during an accident to justify granting the requested exemption from Type C testing
of the LPCI CIVs with air as the test medium. The licensee's alternative test will measure external valve leakage with
a limit of 5 ml/min using water as the test medium at a pressure of 1045 psig.

IV
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Accordingly, the Commission concluded that the licensee's proposed alternative testing plan and analyses provide
sufficient assurance that the containment atmosphere would not leak out of containment through the LPCI CIVs during
a design basis accident and that containment integrity will be maintained by granting the proposed exemption.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The special circumstances for granting this exemption pursuant to 10 CFR 50.12 have also been identified. As stated
in part in 10 CFR 50.12(a)(2)(ii), special circumstances are present when application of the regulation in the particular
circumstances is not necessary to achieve the underlying purpose of the rule. The purpose of Section III.C of Appendix
J is to measure containment isolation valve leakage rates. This leakage, when summed with the allowable Type A and
Type B leakage is limited to a value which ensures overall containment integrity in preventing the uncontrolled release
of radioactivity to the environment. The licensee has demonstrated through analyses and by proposing alternative
testing criteria, that containment integrity will be maintained. Consequently, the Commission concludes that
the special circumstances of 10 CFR 50.12 (a)(2)(ii) exist in that application of the regulation in these particular
circumstances is not necessary to achieve the underlying purpose of the rule.

V
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Accordingly, the Commission has determined that, pursuant to CFR 50.12 this exemption as described in Section III
above is authorized by law, will not present an undue risk to the public health and safety, and is consistent with the
common defense and security. The Commission further determines that special circumstances as provided in 10 CFR
50.12(a)(2)(ii) are present justifying the exemption.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Therefore, the Commission hereby grants an exemption as described in Section III above the requirements in 10 CFR
50.12, Appendix J, III.C. for performing Type C containment integrated leak rate tests of the CIVs in the LPCI lines
of the RHR system and approves the licensee's alternative testing plan.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Pursuant to CFR 51.32, the Commission has determined that the granting of this exemption will have no significant
impact on the environment (59 FR 19028).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This exemption is effective upon issuance.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
Pursuant to subsection (e)(11) of the Privacy Act of 1974, 5 U.S.C. 552a, the Postal Service is publishing a notice
of a new routine use applicable to its system of records USPS 010.050, Collection and Delivery Records_Delivery of
Mail Through Agents. The new routine use will authorize disclosure of information for the purpose of identifying
addresses as belonging to Commercial Mail Receiving Agencies (CMRAs). CMRAs are private entities which receive
mail on behalf of other persons. Often, the address provided for a person by a CMRA appears to be a typical residential
or business address.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Postal Service, primarily through its law enforcement branch, the Postal Inspection Service, has been working
with the credit card industry to prevent credit card fraud. One form of credit card fraud consists of submitting an
application for a credit card under a fictitious name. Perpetrators of this type of fraud may use an address provided
by a CMRA as a means of avoiding detection. Credit card companies have asked the Postal Service to help them detect such
fraud by identifying CMRA addresses, and the Postal Service has concluded that the identification of CMRA addresses
would be an effective tool in combatting credit card fraud and other types of consumer fraud.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The routine use will authorize disclosure of information only for the purpose of identifying an address as belonging
to a CMRA, and no other information concerning CMRAs or their customers will be disclosed pursuant to the routine use.
Because the routine use will not authorize the disclosure of the identities of CMRA customers, disclosures under
the routine use will not invade the legitimate privacy interests of persons who receive mail through CMRAs. The information
will be disclosed primarily by means of annotations to the Postal Service's Delivery Sequence File (DSF). DSF data,
the use of which is made available to the public through authorized licensees, contains delivery-point addresses,
and it does not include the identities of individuals.

The CBOE proposes to list and trade options on the CBOE Global Telecommunications Index, a new securities index developed
by the CBOE and based on stocks and ADRs
<FOOTCITE>5</FOOTCITE>
 of international telecommunications companies that are traded on the American Stock Exchange (``Amex''), the New
York Stock Exchange (``NYSE''), or are national market securities traded through the facilities of the National
Association of Securities Dealers Automated Quotation system (``NASDAQ''). The CBOE also proposes to list either
long-term options on the full-value Index or long-term options on a reduced-value Index that will be computed at one-tenth
of the value of the Global Telecommunications Index (``Global Telecommunications LEAPS'' or ``Index LEAPS'').
<FOOTCITE>6</FOOTCITE>
 Global Telecommunications LEAPS will trade independent of and in addition to regular Global Telecommunications
Index options traded on the Exchange,
<FOOTCITE>7</FOOTCITE>
 however, as discussed below, position and exercise limits of Index LEAPS and regular Index options will be aggregated.

not currently represented in the derivative markets and, as such, the CBOE concludes, should offer investors a low-cost
means of achieving diversification of their portfolios toward or away from the global telecommunications industry.
The CBOE believes the Index will provide retail and institutional investors with a means of benefitting from their
forecasts of that industry's market performance. Options on the Index also can be utilized by portfolio managers
and investors to provide a performance measure and evaluation guide for passively or actively managed global telecommunications
industry funds, as well as a means of hedging the risks of investing in the global telecommunications industry.

B. Composition of the Index
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Index is based on securities representing twenty U.S. and foreign companies that the Exchange believes are representative
of the global telecommunications industry, all of which trade domestically as either stocks or ADRs. Fourteen of
these securities currently trade on the NYSE, one trades on the Amex, and five trade through NASDQ. The Index is price-weighted
and will be calculated on a real-time basis using last sale prices.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As of the close of trading on February 11, 1994, the Index was valued at 149.63.
<FOOTCITE>8</FOOTCITE>
 As of November 30, 1993, the market capitalizations of the individual securities in the Index ranged from a high of
$73.61 billion (AT&amp;T) to a low of $144.21 million (Atlantic Tele-Network, Inc.), with the mean and median being
$14.79 billion and $8.14 billion, respectively. The market capitalization of all the securities in the Index was
$295.74 billion. The total number of shares outstanding for the stocks and ADRs in the Index ranged from a high of 1.35
billion shares (AT&amp;T) to a low of 12.27 million shares (Atlantic Tele-Network, Inc.). The average price per share
of the securities in the Index, for the six-month period between June 1 and November 30, 1993, ranged from a high of $78.19
(Compania De Telefonos De Chile) to a low of $12.79 (Atlantic Tele-Network, Inc.). In addition, the average daily
trading volume of the stocks and ADRs in the Index, for the same six-month period, ranged from a high of 1.89 million
shares per day (AT&amp;T) to a low of 51,675 shares per day (Atlantic Tele-Network, Inc.), with the mean and median
being 425,652 and 252,187 shares, respectively. Lastly, no one stock or ADR accounted for more than 9.08% of the Index's
total value (Compania De Telefonos De Chile) and the percentage weighting of the five largest issues in the Index accounted
for 37.07% of the Index's value. The percentage weighting of the lowest weighted component was 1.27% of the Index (Atlantic
Tele-Network, Inc.) and the percentage weighting of the five smallest issues in the Index accounted for 11.66% of
the Index's value.

C. Maintenance
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Index will be maintained by the CBOE. The CBOE may change the composition of the Index at any time, subject to compliance
with the maintenance criteria discussed herein, to reflect the conditions in the global telecommunications industry.
If it becomes necessary to replace a security in the Index, the Exchange represents that it will make every effort to
add new stocks and/or ADRs that are representative of the global telecommunications industry and will take into account
a security's capitalization, liquidity, volatility, and name recognition of the proposed replacement. Further,
securities may be replaced in the event of certain corporate events, such as takeovers or mergers, that change the
nature of the security. If, however, the Exchange determines to increase the number of Index component securities
to greater than twenty-six or reduce the number of Index component securities to fewer than fourteen, the proposal
provides that the CBOE will submit a rule filing with the Commission pursuant to Section 19(b) of the Act. In addition,
in choosing replacement securities for the Index, the CBOE will be required to ensure that at least 90% of the weight
of the Index continues to be made up of stocks and ADRs that are eligible for standardized options trading.
<FOOTCITE>9</FOOTCITE>
 Finally, the CBOE will be required to ensure that each component of the Index is subject to last sale reporting requirements
in the U.S.

 note 4. The CBOE's options listing standards, which are uniform among the options exchanges, provide that a security
underlying an option must, among other things, meet the following requirements: (1) the public float must be at least
7,000,000; (2) there must be a minimum of 2,000 stockholders; (3) trading volume must have been at least 2.4 million
over the preceding twelve months; and (4) the market price must have been at least $7.50 for a majority of the business
days during the preceding three calendar months. See CBOE Rule 5.3. With respect to ADRs' in addition to the above standards:
(1) the Exchange must have in place a comprehensive surveillance agreement with the primary exchange in the home country
where the security underlying the ADR is traded: or (2) the trading volume in the U.S. markets where the ADR is traded

D. Applicability of CBOE Rules Regarding Index Options
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Except as modified by this order, the rules in Chapter XXIV of the CBOE Rules will be applicable to Global Telecommunications
Index options and full-value and reduced-value Index LEAPS. Those rules address, among other things, the applicable
position and exercise limits, policies regarding trading halts and suspensions, and margin treatment for narrow-based
index options. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

E. Calculation of the Index
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The CBOE Global Telecommunications Index is a price-weighted index and reflects changes in the prices of the Index
component securities relative to the Index's base date of January 2, 1992. Specifically, the Index value is calculated
by adding the prices of the component stocks and ADRs and then dividing this summation by a divisor that is equal to the
number of the components of the Index to get the average price. To maintain the continuity of the Index, the divisor
will be adjusted to reflect non-market changes in the prices of the component securities as well as changes in the composition
of the Index. Changes that may result in divisor adjustments include, but are not limited to, stock splits and dividends,
spin-offs, certain rights issuances, and mergers and acquisitions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Index will be calculated continuously and will be disseminated to the Options Price Reporting Authority (``OPRA'')
every fifteen seconds by the CBOE, based on the last-sale prices of the component stocks and ADRs.
<FOOTCITE>11</FOOTCITE>
 OPRA, in turn, will disseminate the Index value to other financial vendors such as Reuters, Telerate, and Quotron.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<FOOTNOTE>
<FOOTNAME>
<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->
11
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

</FOOTNAME>
<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->
For purposes of the daily dissemination of the Index value, if a stock included in the Index has not opened for trading,
the CBOE will use the closing value of that stock on the prior trading day when calculating the value of the Index, until
the stock opens for trading. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
</FOOTNOTE>

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Index value for purposes of settling outstanding regular Index options and Index LEAPS contracts upon expiration
will be calculated based upon the regular way opening sale prices for each of the Index's component securities in their
primary market on the last trading day prior to expiration. In the case of securities traded on and through NASDAQ,
the first reported sale price will be used. Once all of the component stocks and ADRs have opened, the value of the Index
will be determined and that value will be used as the final settlement value for expiring Index options contracts.
If any of the component stocks or ADRs do not open for trading on the last trading day before expiration, then the prior
trading day's (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
i.e.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, normally Thursday's) last sale price will be used in the Index calculation. In this regard, before deciding to use
Thursday's closing value of a component security for purposes of determining the settlement value of the Index, the
CBOE will wait until the end of the trading day on expiration Friday.

F. Contract Specifications
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposed options on the Index will be cash-settled, European-style options.
<FOOTCITE>12</FOOTCITE>
 Standard options trading hours (8:30 a.m. to 3:10 p.m. Central Standard time) will apply to the contracts. The Index
multiplier will be 100. The strike price interval will be $5.00 for full-value Index options with a duration of one
year or less to expiration.
<FOOTCITE>13</FOOTCITE>
 In addition, pursuant to CBOE Rule 24.9, there may be up to six expiration months outstanding at any given time. Specifically,
there may be up to there expiration months from the March, June, September, and December cycle plus up to three additional
near-term months so that the two nearest term months will always be available. As described in more detail below, the
Exchange also intends to list several Index LEAPS series that expire from twelve to thirty-six months from the date
of issuance.

</FOOTNOTE>

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Lastly, the options on the Index will expire on the Saturday following the third Friday of the expiration month (``Expiration
Friday''). Accordingly, since options on the Index will settle based upon opening prices of the component securities
on the last trading day before expiration (normally a Friday), the last trading day for an expiring Index option series
will normally be the second to the last business day before expiration (normally a Thursday).

G. Listing of Long-Term Options on the Full-Value or Reduced-Value Global Telecommunications Index
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposal provides that the Exchange may list long-term Index options that expire from 12 to 36 months from listing
based on the full-value Global Telecommunications Index or a reduced value Global Telecommunications Index that
will be computed at one-tenth the value of the full-value Index. Existing Exchange requirements applicable to full-value
and reduced-value LEAPS will apply to full-value and reduced-value Index LEAPS.
<FOOTCITE>14</FOOTCITE>
 The current and closing Index value for reduced-value Global Telecommunications LEAPS will be computed by dividing
the value of the full-value Index by 10 and rounding the resulting figure to the nearest one-hundredth. For example,
an Index value of 149.76 would be 14.98 for the Index LEAPS and 149.73 would become 14.97. The reduced-value Index LEAPS
will have a European-style exercise and will be subject to the same rules that govern the trading of all the Exchange's
index options, including sales practice rules, margin requirements and floor trading procedures. Pursuant to CBOE
Rule 24.9, the strike price interval for the reduced-value Index LEAPS will be no less than $2.50 instead of $5.00.

H. Position and Exercise Limits, Margin Requirements, and Trading Halts
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Because the Index is classified as an ``industry index'' under CBOE rules,
<FOOTCITE>15</FOOTCITE>
 Exchange rules that are applicable to the trading of options on narrow-based indexes will apply to the trading of Global
Telecommunications Index options and Global Telecommunications Index LEAPS. Specifically, Exchange rules governing
margin requirements,
<FOOTCITE>16</FOOTCITE>
 position and exercise limits,
<FOOTCITE>17</FOOTCITE>
 and trading halt procedures
<FOOTCITE>18</FOOTCITE>
 that are applicable to the trading of narrow-based index options will apply to options traded on the Index. The proposal
further provides that, for purposes of determining whether a given position in reduced-value Index LEAPS complies
with applicable position and exercise limits, positions in reduced-value Index LEAPS will be aggregated with positions
in the full-value Index options. For these purposes, ten reduced-value contract will equal one full-value contract.

100% of the current market value of the options contract plus 20% of the underlying aggregate Index value, less any
out-of-the-money amount, with a minimum requirement of the options premium plus 10% of the underlying Index value;
and (2) for long term options positions, 100% of the options premium paid.

I. Surveillance
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Surveillence procedures currently used to monitor trading in each of the Exchange's other index options will also
be used to monitor trading in regular Index options and in full-value and reduced-value Index LEAPS. These procedures
include complete access to trading activity in the underlying securities. Further, the Intermarket Surviellance
Group Agreement, dated July 14, 1983, as amended on January 29, 1990, will be applicable to the trading of options on
the Index.

The Intermarket Surveillance Group (``ISG'') was formed on July 14, 1983 to, among other things, coordinate more
effectively surveillance and investigative information sharing arrangements in the stock and options markets.
See Intermarket Surveillance Group Agreement, July 14, 1983. The most recent amendment to the ISG Agreement, which
incorporates the original agreement and all amendments made thereafter, was signed by ISG members on January 29,
1990. See Second Amendment to the Intermarket Surveillance Group Agreement, January 29, 1990. The members of the
ISG are: the Amex; the Boston Stock Exchange, Inc.; the CBOE; the Chicago Stock Exchange, Inc.; the National Association
of Securities Dealers, Inc. (``NASD''); the NYSE; the Pacific Stock Exchange, Inc.; and the Philadelphia Stock Exchange,
Inc. Because of potential opportunities for trading abuses involving stock index futures, stock options, and the
underlying stock and the need for greater sharing of surveillance information for these potential intermarket trading
abuses, the major stock index futures exchanges (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 -->
e.g.,

III. Findings and Conclusions
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Commission finds that the proposed rule change is consistent with the requirements of the Act and the rules and
regulations thereunder applicable to a national securities exchange, and, in particular, the requirements of Section
6(b)(5).
<FOOTCITE>20</FOOTCITE>
 Specifically, the Commission finds that the trading of Global telecommunications Index options, including full-value
and reduced-value Index LEAPS, will serve to promote the public interest and help to remove impediments to a free and
open securities market by providing investors with a means of hedging exposure to market risk associated with securities
in the global telecommunications industry.

Pursuant to Section 6(b)(5) of the Act, the Commission must predicate approval of any new option proposal upon a finding
that the introduction of such new derivative instrument is in the public interest. Such a finding would be difficult
for a derivative instrument that served no hedging or other economic function, because any benefits that might be
derived by market participants likely would be outweighed by the potential for manipulation, diminished public
confidence in the integrity of the markets, and other valid regulatory concerns. In this regard, the trading of listed
index options and full-value index LEAPS on the Global Telecommunications Index will provide investors with a hedging
vehicle that should reflect the overall movement of the stocks and ADRs comprising the global telecommunications
industry in the U.S. securities markets. The Commission also believes that these Index options will provide investors
with a means by which to make investment decisions in the global telecommunications industry sector of the U.S. securities
markets, allowing them to establish positions or increase existing positions in such markets in a cost effective
manner. Moreover, the Commission believes that the reduced-value Index LEAPS, which will be traded on an index computed
at one-tenth the value of the Global Telecommunications Index, will serve the needs of retail investors by providing
them with the opportunity to use a long-term option to hedge their portfolios from long-term market moves at a reduced
cost.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
</FOOTNOTE>

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The trading of options on the Global Telecommunications Index, including full-value and reduced-value LEAPS on
the Index, however, raises several concerns, namely issues related to index design, customer protection, surveillance,
and market impact. The Commission believes, for the reasons discussed below, that the CBOE adequately has addressed
these concerns.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
A. Index Design and Structure
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Commission finds that the Global Telecommunications Index is a narrow-based index. The Global Telecommunications
Index is composed of only twenty securities, all of which are within one industry_the global telecommunications
industry.
<FOOTCITE>22</FOOTCITE>
 Accordingly, the Commission believes it is appropriate for the CBOE to apply its rules governing narrow-based index
options to trading in the Index options.
<FOOTCITE>23</FOOTCITE>

<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->
The reduced-value Global Telecommunications Index, which is composed of the same component securities as the Index
and calculated by dividing the Index value by ten, is identical to the Global Telecommunications Index.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Commission also finds that the large capitalizations, liquid markets, and relative weightings of the Index's
component securities significantly minimize the potential for manipulation of the Index. First, the overwhelming
majority of the components that compose the Index are actively traded, with a mean and median average daily trading
volume of 425,652 and 252,187 shares, respectively.

 Second, the market capitalizations of the securities in the Index are very large, ranging from a high of $73.61 billion
to a low of $144.21 million as of November 30, 1993, with the mean and median being $14.79 billion and $8.14 billion,
respectively. Third, although the Index is only comprised of twenty component securities, no one particular security
or group of securities dominates the Index. Specifically, no one stock or ADR comprises more than 9.08% of the Index's
total value and the percentage weighting of the five largest issues in the Index account for 37.07% of the Index's value.
<FOOTCITE>25</FOOTCITE>
 Fourth, at least 90% of the twenty securities in the Index by weight must be eligible for standardized options trading.
<FOOTCITE>26</FOOTCITE>
 The proposed CBOE maintenance requirement that 90% of the weighting of the Index be comprised of securities that are
eligible for options trading will ensure that the Index is almost completely comprised of options eligible securities.
Fifth, if the CBOE increases the number of component securities to more than twenty-six or decreases that number to
less than fourteen, the CBOE will be required to seek Commission approval pursuant to Section 19(b)(2) of the Act before
listing new strike price or expiration month series of Global Telecommunications Index options and Index LEAPS.
This will help protect against material changes in the composition and design of the Index that might adversely affect
the CBOE's obligations to protect investors and to maintain fair and orderly markets in Global Telecommunications
Index options and Index LEAPS. Sixth, the CBOE will be required to ensure that each component of the Index is subject
to last sale reporting requirements in the U.S.
<FOOTCITE>27</FOOTCITE>
 This will further reduce the potential for manipulation of the value of the Index. Finally, the Commission believes
that the expense of attempting to manipulate the value of the Global Telecommunications Index in any significant
way through trading in component stocks, ADRs, or securities underlying ADRs (or options on those securities) coupled
with, as discussed below, existing mechanisms to monitor trading activity in those securities, will help deter such
illegal activity.

For an index with a significantly greater number of securities than twenty issues, the Commission might come to a different
conclusion if only a few securities accounted for a significant portion of the index's weighting. Further, if an index
contained only a few stocks, the Commission might question whether it can be traded as an index product.

The Commission believes that a regulatory system designed to protect public customers must be in place before the
trading of sophisticated financial instruments, such as Global Telecommunications Index Options (including full-value
and reduced-value Global Telecommunications (LEAPS), can commence on a national securities exchange. The Commission
notes that the trading of standardized exchange-traded options occurs in an environment that is designed to ensure,
among other things, that: (1) the special risks of options are disclosed to public customers; (2) only investors capable
of evaluating and bearing the risks of options trading are engaged in such trading; and (3) special compliance procedures
are applicable to options accounts. Accordingly, because the Index options and Index LEAPS will be subject to the
same regulatory regime as the other standardized options currently traded on the CBOE, the Commission believes that
adequate safeguards are in place to ensure the protection of investors in Global Telecommunications Index options
and full-value and reduced-value Global Telecommunications Index LEAPS.

The Commission believes that a surveillance sharing agreement between an exchange proposing to list a security index
derivative product and the exchange(s) trading the securities underlying the derivative product is an important
measure for surveillance of the derivative and underlying securities markets. Such agreements ensure the availability
of information necessary to detect and deter potential manipulations and other trading abuses, thereby making the
security index product less readily susceptible to manipulation.
<FOOTCITE>28</FOOTCITE>
 In this regard, the CBOE, NYSE, Amex, and NASD are all members of the ISG, which provides for the exchange of all necessary
surveillance information.
<FOOTCITE>29</FOOTCITE>
 Further, as to the foreign components of the Index, either the Exchange has comprehensive surveillance sharing agreements
with the primary foreign markets for the securities underlying the ADRs or the U.S. is the relevant market for surveillance
purposes.

 If the prices of the ADR components, or the composition of the Index, should change so that greater than 20% of the weight
of the Index would be represented by ADRs whose underlying securities were not the subject of a comprehensive surveillance
sharing agreement with the CBOE, then it would be different for the Commission to reach the conclusions reached in
this order and the Commission would have to determine whether it would be suitable for the Exchange to continue to trade
options on this Index. The CBOE should, accordingly, notify the Commission immediately if more than 20% of the numerical
value of the Index is represented by ADRs whose underlying securities are not subject to a comprehensive surveillance
sharing agreement. Such a change in the current relative weights of the Index or in the composition of the Index may
warrant the submission of a rule filing pursuant to Section 19 of the Act. In determining whether a particular ADR is
subject to a comprehensive surveillance sharing agreement see,

The Commission believes that the listing and trading of Global Telecommunications Index options, including full-value
and reduced-value Index LEAPS, on the CBOE will not adversely impact the underlying securities markets.
<FOOTCITE>31</FOOTCITE>
 First, as described above, for the most part, no one security or group of securities dominates the Index. Second, because,
at least 90% of the numerical value of the Index must be accounted for by securities that meet the Exchange's options
listing standards,
<FOOTCITE>32</FOOTCITE>
 and because each of the component securities must be subject to last sale reporting requirements,
<FOOTCITE>33</FOOTCITE>
 the component securities generally will be actively-traded, highly-capitalized securities. Third, the 10,500
contract position and exercise limits applicable to Index options and Index LEAPS will serve to minimize potential
manipulation and market impact concerns. Forth, the risk to investors of contra-party non-performance will be minimized
because the Index options and Index LEAPS will be issued and guaranteed by the Options Clearing Corporation just like
any other standardized option traded in the United States.

In addition, the CBOE has represented that the CBOE and the OPRA have the necessary systems capacity to support those
new series of index options that would result from the introduction of Index options and Index LEAPS. See Memorandum
from Joe Corrigan, Executive Director, OPRA, to Eileen Smith, Director, Product Development, Research Department,

Lastly, the Commission believes that settling expiring Global Telecommunications Index options (including full-value
and reduced-value Index LEAPS) based on the opening prices of component securities is consistent with the Act. As
noted in other contexts, valuing options for exercise settlement on expiration based on opening prices rather than
closing prices may help reduce adverse effects on markets for securities underlying options on the Index.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. Specifically, Amendment No. 1 raises the maintenance standards originally proposed by the Exchange by requiring
the CBOE to ensure that at least 90% of the Index, by weight, is composed of securities that are eligible for equity options
trading pursuant to CBOE Rule 5.3. As stated above, the Commission believes that this requirement has the effect of
ensuring that the Index is composed of highly-capitalized, actively-traded securities which serve to minimize
the possibility that the Index can be easily manipulated. Additionally, the Commission notes that this is the same
standard that the Commission recently approved for the listing and trading of index options and index LEAPS on the
CBOE Telecommunications Index.
<FOOTCITE>35</FOOTCITE>
 As a result, the Commission believes that good cause exists for approving Amendment No. 1 on an accelerated basis.

At the request of the Commission, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York (``FRBNY''), and the Board of Governors of the
Federal Reserve System (``Fed'') DTC issued a notice to participants requesting comment on issues raised by the regulators.
DTC received ten comment letters. The issues and the comment letters will be discussed in detail later in this approval
order.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposed rule change makes DTC's existing MMI settlement services available for transactions in additional
types of MMIs. New MMI programs include those for institutional certificates of deposit (``CD''), municipal commercial
paper, and bankers' acceptances. The existing DTC MMI programs to be expanded or enhanced include those for corporate
commercial paper, medium-term notes, preferred stock in a CP-like mode, short-term bank notes, and discount notes.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The new MMI programs, along with the existing MMI programs, are an extension of DTC's Same-Day Funds Settlement (``SDFS'')
system.
<FOOTCITE>4</FOOTCITE>
The automated operating procedures for MMIs are virtually the same as those followed by SDFS participants and by Institutional
Delivery (``ID'') system users for basic depository services in other eligible SDFS securities. The MMI issues being
made SDFS-eligible will be distributed in book-entry-only form by the issuer's issuing agent that, as in the commercial
paper (``CP'') and medium-term note MMI programs, will send MMI issuance instructions to DTC electronically. Settlement
of an issue will be on the same day as the issuance or on a specified future day. The issuer's paying agent, that will also
serve as DTC's custodian, will hold a master or balance MMI certificate for DTC unless the issuer and its issuing and
paying agent bank choose to distribute uncertificated MMIs through DTC.
<FOOTCITE>5</FOOTCITE>
Because SDFS-eligible MMIs will be book-entry-only, participant operating procedures for deposits and withdrawals
will not apply to MMIs.

DTC's SDFS system currently includes the following issue types: Corporate commercial paper, municipal notes and
bonds, municipal variable-rate demand obligations, zero coupon bonds backed by U.S. Government securities, continuously
offered medium-term corporate notes, short-term bank notes, auction-rate and tender-rate preferred stocks and
notes, collateralized mortgage obligations and other asset-backed securities, Government trust certificates
and Government agency securities not eligible for the Fed's book-entry system, retail certificates of deposit,
corporate and municipal variable mode obligations, corporate bonds, discount notes, and unit trusts. For a detailed
description and discussion of DTC's SDFS system, including the implementation of the commercial paper program,

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The fundamental risk in the SDFS system is that a participant will default in its payment obligation. The new MMI programs
are offered as an extension of DTC's current SDFS system; therefore, DTC will employ the same risk management controls
(
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
e.g., 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
net debit collateralization, net debit caps, and receiver-authorized deliveries) to transactions in these new
programs as are employed in the current SDFS system.

</FOOTNOTE>

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Net debit collateralization requires each participant to maintain in its account throughout the processing day
collateral at least equal in value to the participant's net settlement debit. If during the processing day a transaction
will cause a net debit greater than the amount of collateral in the participant's account at the time the transaction
is being processed, DTC will recycle the transaction until there is sufficient collateral in the participant's account.
Transactions in the new MMI programs also will be subject to the participant's net debit cap.
<FOOTCITE>7</FOOTCITE>
 The net debit cap helps to protect against abnormal intraday debit peaks that are out of line with a participant's prior
month's average daily activity level. The net debit cap also reduces the possibility that the failure to settle by
more than one participant will not cause DTC to exceed its liquidity resources. The new MMI programs also will utilize
the receiver-authorized delivery control which allows a participant to monitor deliveries and payment orders directed
to its account before the orders are posted to the account.

Each participant's net debit is limited throughout the processing day to a net debit cap that is the least of the following
four amounts: (1) an amount forty times the participant's required and voluntary deposits to the SDFS fund, (2) an
amount that is equal to seventy-five percent of DTC's liquidity resources, including cash deposits to the SDFS fund
and lines of credit for loans to facilitate SDFS settlement, (3) an amount, if any, determined by the participant's
settling bank, and (4) an amount, if any, determined by DTC.

In addition, DTC's three failure to settle procedures applicable to the CP program will be applicable to the new MMI
programs. First, DTC will employ the same procedures with regard to the sequence in which DTC will use MMI collateral
and eliminate payment order debits in a failing participant's account. Second, if DTC is notified before 3 p.m. eastern
standard time (``E.S.T.'') that a paying agent will not pay on an MMI issuer's maturity presentments, reorganization
presentments, periodic principal presentments, or periodic income presentments or if DTC is informed of an MMI issuer's
bankruptcy and a participant fails to settle with DTC on that day, DTC has the authority to reduce the settlement credits
of participants who had transactions on the day of default with the defaulting issuer or the defaulting participant
on the day of the default. Third, if the paying agent has not settled with DTC by noon E.S.T. on the DTC business day following
the settlement day or if a paying agent is determined to be insolvent according to DTC's rules, DTC will notify the issuers
utilizing that paying agent and provide those issuers with information on any presentments related to their MMIs
on which the PA failed to pay DTC.

C. Expanded or Improved Existing MMI Programs
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
DTC will be expanding its CP program to include ``uncommon CP.'' Uncommon CP is CP paying income periodically, a variable
amount of income, or a variable amount of principal. It also includes CP denominated in a foreign currency, CP with
a maturity of 271 days to a year, or corporate variable-rate demand obligations in CP mode. These instruments were
not included in the original CP program.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
DTC also will be enhancing their MMI programs for medium-term notes, short-term notes, discount notes, and preferred
stock in CP-like mode. The medium-term note program will be enhanced by DTC's collection and allocation of income,
principal, reorganization, and maturity payments within the SDFS system. Paying agents will no longer have to separately
wire such payments to DTC. Instead, as with maturity payments in the CP program, these payments will be included in
each paying agent's net settlement figure due to or from DTC at the end of each day. Similarly, the short-term note program
will be enhanced with the inclusion in the SDFS system maturity payments and periodic income payments in the SDFS system
and in the paying agents' net SDFS amounts due to or from DTC. The restriction that short-term notes must have a minimum
maturity period of thirty days to be included in this program will be removed. The short-term notes program, the discount
notes program, and the preferred stock in CP-like mode program will all provide for uncertificated issuer programs.
However, one master note or certificate may be held for DTC by the paying agent.

 of the Act requires that the rules of a clearing agency be designed to promote the prompt and accurate clearance and
settlement of securities transactions and to assure the safeguarding of securities and funds which are in the custody
or control of the clearing agency or for which it is responsible. As discussed below, the Commission believes the DTC's
proposed rule change is consistent with DTC's obligations under the Act.

As previously described, the new MMI programs and the expanded and enhanced programs are an extension of DTC's current
SDFS system and include many of the same risk management features that are employed in the SDFS system. The Commission
previously examined these features when DTC first proposed the SDFS system and again when the CP program was added.
<FOOTCITE>9</FOOTCITE>
 At those times, the Commission found, and continues to believe, that these risk management measures are consistent
with Section 17A of the Act and should minimize the impact of a default by a participant in the SDFS system.

The use of provisional credits and unwind procedures if an MMI issuer were to default, however, could increase the
risk of settlement gridlock in certain circumstances. For example, if DTC were to confirm the insolvency of an MMI
issuer before 3:00 p.m.,
<FOOTCITE>10</FOOTCITE>
 DTC would reverse all participants' credits attributable to the insolvent issuer without regard to any of the risk
management controls. Such reversals of credits could result in a participant having a net debit that exceeds the participant's
net debit cap and DTC's liquidity resources. If such a participant then failed to settle its net debit with DTC, DTC
would possibly have difficulty completing other settlements thus creating systemic risk.

If DTC cannot confirm that an MMI issuer is insolvent before 3 p.m. EST., DTC will not reverse credits attributable
to that issuer because after 3 p.m. E.S.T. credits are no longer provisional in DTC's SDFS system.

As an interim solution, DTC proposed for comment the implementation of an additional $500 million line of credit dedicated
to the completion of settlement in the SDFS system in the event a participant fails to settle after application of the
unwind procedures. The additional line of credit would be supported by securities pledged to the SDFS fund and would
not be included as a part of DTC's liquidity resources when determining a participant's net debit cap. DTC also proposed
as a long term solution, a SDFS system enhancement that would conduct default scenarios to assure that unwind procedures
would not cause a liquidity problem.

</FOOTNAME>
<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->
DTC has proposed two SDFS system enhancements that will eventually replace the additional line of credit dedicated
to settlement in the SDFS system. The future system enhancements will retain unwind procedures but will allow DTC
to run intraday computerized double default scenarios (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 -->
i.e., 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->
an MMI issuer default and an SDFS participant default due to debits created by the unwind procedures) to help assure
that each participant's net debit is within DTC's liquidity resources. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under the first system enhancement, DTC will subtract from a participant's actual overall SDFS net debit or credit
amount the amount of the participant's largest provisional net credit due to transactions in any single issuer's
MMIs. DTC then will limit the resulting net debit from all other SDFS transactions (``liquidity net debit'') to the
amount of DTC's liquidity resources (``liquidity net debit cap''), which as of April 18, 1994, was approximately
$760 million. If a transaction will cause a participant's liquidity net debit to exceed DTC's liquidity net debit
cap, DTC will block and recycle the transaction until credits are received from transactions in MMIs of MMI issues
other than those of the issuer of the largest provisional net credit. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under the second system enhancement, DTC will subtract the amount of a participant's largest provisional net credit
due to transactions in any single issuer's MMIs from the participant's collateral monitor (``simulated collateral
monitor''). If a transaction will cause the simulated collateral monitor to turn negative (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 -->
i.e., 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->
the participant's collateral would be insufficient to cover its simulated net debit after the transaction), the
transaction will be blocked. Blocked transactions will be recycled until credits from other transactions in MMIs
of issuers other than those of the largest provisional net credit cause the simulated collateral monitor to be positive.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
DTC expects to implement the two system enhancements subsequent to the industry conversion to same-day funds settlement
that is scheduled for implementation in 1996. Letter from Richard B. Nesson, Executive Vice President and General
Counsel, DTC, to Peter R. Geraghty, [Staff Attorney], Division of Market Regulation, Commission (April 18, 1994).

DTC solicited comment from its participants regarding (1) the necessity of unwind procedures in the SDFS service
that override risk management controls and (2) if unwind procedures are necessary, whether participants would be
prepared to absorb the additional costs of mechanisms to assure that use of the unwind procedures on the same day that
any DTC participant failed to settle would not deplete DTC's liquidity resources. DTC received ten comment letters
from participants and two from industry organizations.
<FOOTCITE>12</FOOTCITE>
 Generally, the comments supported the use of unwind procedures as a way to replicate the risks taken by parties to transactions
in the physical MMI market (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
i.e., 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
to place the risk and burden of default on the appropriate party, which is on the issuer or the purchaser instead of on
the issuing and paying agent). The comments also generally supported the interim solution of obtaining an additional,
dedicated line of credit and allocating its cost to SDFS system participants.

DTC will begin the expansion of its MMI programs with the institutional CDs programs. DTC will begin the pilot program
with four bank issuers and will expand the pilot program over the net two months. Until DTC secures the additional $500
million line of credit, the pilot program will be limited to: (1) 120 CD programs, (2) A value not to exceed $20 billion
on deposit with DTC, (3) A percentage of the total CD market on deposit at DTC not to exceed 5.7%, and (4) A daily average
face amount of CD issuances not to exceed $1 billion.
<FOOTCITE>16</FOOTCITE>
 DTC has agreed that if prior to securing the $500 million line of credit the addition of CDs according to the schedule
increases simulated breaches of its liquidity resources (currently $760 million), DTC will slow down or stop the
addition of CD programs after consultation with the regulators. DTC also has agreed that if subsequent to attaining
the additional line of credit, simulations show breaches of DTC's new overall liquidity resources, due to the expansion
of the MMI program to include different types of MMI instruments, DTC again will slow down or stop expansion of the program
after consultation with the regulators.

The Commission believes that the additional risk management controls to be implemented with the new and enhanced
MMI programs in conjunction with the current SDFS system risk management controls should help further reduce the
possibility that a double default scenario will exceed DTC's liquidity resources. In addition, the Commission believes
the controlled expansion of the SDFS program to include additional types of MMIs will reduce the costs, inefficiencies,
and risks associated with the clearance and settlement of physically transferred securities by providing the benefits
of centralized, automated, book-entry clearance and settlement.

Applicants' Representations
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
1. IDS Life of New York is a stock life insurance company organized under the laws of New York and is a wholly owned subsidiary
of IDS Life Insurance Company (``IDS Life'') of Minneapolis, Minnesota. IDS Life is a wholly owned subsidiary of IDS
Financial Corporation, which, in turn, is a wholly owned subsidiary of the American Express Company. IDS Financial
Services Inc. is the principal underwriter of the Variable Accounts and also is a subsidiary of IDS Financial Corporation.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. Variable Accounts 4, 5, and 6 were established on November 12, 1981. Variable Account 9 was established on February
12, 1986. Variable Accounts 10 and 11 were established on October 8, 1991. All Variable Accounts were established
as separate accounts under New York law to fund variable annuity contracts issued by IDS Life of New York. The Variable
Accounts are registered together as a single unit investment trust under the 1940 Act.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. IDS Life of New York proposes to issue and distribute a group deferred annuity contract (``Contract'') that is designed
primarily to fund retirement plans. The owners of the group Contracts are the employers or other organizations that
sponsor the plans. Participation in the Contract will be accounted for separately by the issuance of certificates
showing the participants' interests under the Contract. Purchase payments may be accumulated before retirement
on a variable and/or fixed basis, and annuity payments will be received after retirement on a variable and/or fixed
basis. A registration statement on Form N&hyph;4 has been filed with the Commission in connection with the Contracts.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. The Contracts provide for allocation of purchase payments to the Variable Accounts or to a fixed account of IDS Life
of New York. The Variable Accounts, in turn, will invest solely in the shares of the IDS Life Retirement Annuity Mutual
Funds (``Funds''). The Funds are registered with the Commission as diversified open-end management investment
companies.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
5. The Contracts and related certificates provide for certain charges. IDS Life of New York will make a charge against
the certificate value for any premium taxes to the extent the taxes are payable.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
6. IDS Life of New York will deduct an annual administrative charge of $30 from the value of each certificate. This annual
administrative charge can not be increased and does not apply after retirement payments begin. The administrative
charge represents reimbursement for only the actual administrative costs expected to be incurred over the life of
the certificates.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
7. No sales charge is collected or deducted at the time purchase payments are applied under the Contracts and related
certificates. A contingent deferred sales charge (``surrender charge'') will be assessed on certain full or partial
surrenders. A surrender charge applies if all or part of the certificate value is withdrawn within the first eleven
certificate years. The surrender charge is 8 percent of the amount surrendered in the first through fourth certificate
years, and then declines by 1 percent from 7 percent in the fifth certificate year to 1 percent in the eleventh certificate
year. In no event will the aggregate surrender charges exceed 8.5 percent of purchase payments made to a certificate.
The surrender charge can not be increased during the life of the Contracts and related certificates.

<!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
8. There is no surrender charge on amounts surrendered: After the eleventh certificate year, due to a participant's
retirement under the plan on or after age 55; due to the death of the participant; or upon settlement of the certificate
under an annuity payment plan.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
9. IDS Life of New York will assess the Variable Accounts of a daily mortality and expense risk charge equal to 1 percent
of the average daily net assets of the Variable Accounts on an annual basis. IDS Life of New York estimates that two-thirds
of this charge is for assumption of the mortality risk and one-third is for the assumption of the expense risk. This
charge cannot be increased during the life of the Contracts and does not apply after retirement payments begin.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
10. IDS Life of New York will assume certain mortality and expense risks under the contracts. IDS Life of New York assumes
certain mortality risks by its contractual obligation to continue to make retirement payments for the entire life
of the annuitant under annuity obligations involving life contingencies. This obligation assures each annuitant
that neither the annuitant's own longevity nor an improvement in life expectancy generally will have an adverse effect
on the retirement payments received under the Contracts and related certificates. This assurance relieves the annuitant
from the risk of outliving the amounts accumulated for retirement. The payment option tables contained in the Contracts
are based on the 1983 Individual Annuity Mortality Table. The use of these tables is guaranteed for the life of the Contracts
and related certificates.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
11. IDS Life of New York assumes additional mortality and certain expense risks under the Contracts and certificates
by its contractual obligation to pay a death benefit in a lump sum (or in the form of an annuity payment plan) upon the
death of a participant prior to the retirement date.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
12. IDS Life of New York assumes an expense risk because the administrative charge may be insufficient to cover administrative
expenses. These include the costs and expenses of processing purchase payments, retirement payments, surrenders,
and transfers; furnishing confirmation notices and periodic reports; calculating mortality and expense risk charges;
preparing voting materials and tax reports; updating registration statements; and actuarial and other expenses.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
13. If the administrative charge and the mortality and expense risk charge are insufficient to cover the costs and
expenses assumed, the loss will be borne by IDS Life of New York. Conversely, if the amount deducted proves more than
sufficient, the excess will represent a profit to IDS Life of New York. As noted above, IDS Life of New York does not expect
to profit from the administrative charge. However, IDS Life of New York does expect to profit from the mortality and
expense risk charge. Any profit realized from this charge would be available to IDS Life of New York for, among other
things, payment of distribution expenses.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
Applicants' Legal Analysis and Conditions
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
1. Section 26(a)(2)(C) and 27(c)(2) of the 1940 Act prohibit a registered unit investment trust and any depositor
or underwriter thereof from selling periodic payment plan certificates unless the proceeds of all payments (except
such amounts as are deducted for sales loads) are deposited with a trustee or custodian having the qualifications
prescribed by section 26(a)(1) of the 1940 Act and held under an agreement that provides that no payment to the depositor
or principal underwriter shall be allowed except as a fee, not exceeding such reasonable amount as the Commission
may prescribe, for bookkeeping and other administrative services.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. Applicants request an exemption from sections 26(a)(2)(c) and 27(c)(2) to the extent necessary to permit the issuance
and sale of the Contracts and related certificates providing for the 1 percent mortality and expense risk charge.
Section 6(c) of the 1940 Act, in pertinent part, provides that the Commission, by order upon application, may conditionally
or unconditionally exempt any person, security, or transaction, or any class or classes of persons, securities,
or transactions, from any provisions of the 1940 Act to the extent that such exemption is necessary or appropriate
in the public interest and consistent with the protection of investors and the purposes fairly intended by the policy
and provisions of the Act. Applicants state that, for the following reasons, their exemptive requests meet the standards
set out in section 6(c) and, therefore, an order should be granted.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. Applicants represent that the level of the mortality and expense risk charge is within the range of industry practice
for comparable variable annuity products. IDS Life of New York has reviewed publicly available information about
other annuity products, taking into consideration such factors as current charge levels, charge guarantees, sales
loads, surrender charges, availability of funds, investment options avaiable under annuity contracts, market
sector and the availability of retirement plans. IDS Life of New York represents that it will maintain at its principal
office, and make available upon request of the Commission or its staff, a memorandum setting forth its analysis, including
its methodology and results.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. Applicants acknowledge that the surrender charge described above may be insufficient to cover all costs relating
to the distribution of the Contracts and certificates and that, if a profit is realized from the mortality and expense
risk charge, all or a portion of such profit may be offset by distribution expenses not reimbursed by the contingent
deferred sales charge. In such circumstances, a portion of the mortality and expense risk charge might be viewed as
providing for a portion of the distribution costs of the Contracts and related certificates.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
5. Notwithstanding the foregoing, IDS Life of New York has concluded that there is a reasonable likelihood that the
proposed distribution financing arrangements made with respect to the Contracts will benefit the Variable Accounts
and investors in the Contracts and related certificates. The basis for such conclusion is set forth in a memorandum
that will be maintained by IDS Life of New York at its principal office and will be available to the Commission or its
staff on request.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
6. IDS Life of New York represents that the Variable Accounts will invest only in an underlying mutual fund that, in
the event the fund should adopt any plan under Rule 12b&hyph;1 to finance distribution expenses, would have such a
plan formulated and approved by a board of directors, a majority of the members of which are not interested persons
of such fund within the meaning of section 2(a)(19) of the 1940 Act.

and provisions of the Act.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) establishment an Aviation Rulemaking Advisory Committee (ARAC) (56
FR 2190, January 22, 1991; and 58 FR 9230, February 19, 1993). One area of the ARAC deals with noise certification issues.
These issues involve the harmonization of part 36 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR part 36) with Joint Aviation
Requirements (JAR) part 36, their associated guidance material including equivalent procedures, and the interpretation
of the regulations. The FAR/JAR Harmonization Working Group for Helicopters will forward recommendations to the
ARAC, which will determine whether to forward them to the FAA.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Specifically, the FAR/JAR Harmonization Working Group for Helicopters is charged with reviewing the applicable
provisions of subparts A and H, and appendices H and J of the 14 CFR part 36 and harmonizing them with the corresponding
applicable provisions of JAR 36.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ARAC should consider the current international standards and recommended practices, as issued under the International
Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO), Annex 16, Volume 1, and its associated Technical Manual, as the basis for development
of these harmonization proposals. ARAC should also consider recommending a process whereby subsequent ICAO Annex
16 changes are properly incorporated into JAR and FAR 36.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If the ARAC determines that a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NPRM), an Advisory Circular (AC), or both would be appropriated,
those documents are to be submitted, in the format prescribed, to the FAA. The Working Group should make recommendations
to the ARAC in the following manner.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
Reports
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

consideration at the meeting of the ARAC to consider noise certification issues held following publication of this
notice;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) Giver a detailed conceptual presentation on the proposed recommendation to the ARAC before proceeding with the
work stated in item (c) below;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) If considered appropriate, develop NPRM(s) proposing the revised rules for aircraft noise certification, a
supporting economic and other required analysis, advisory and guidance material, and any other collateral documents
the Working Group determines to be needed. Present these recommendations to the ARAC for further consideration and
disposition; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(d) Give a status report on the task at each meeting of the ARAC held to consider noise certification issues.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FAR/JAR Harmonization Working Group for Helicopters will be comprised of experts from those organizations having
an interest in the tasks assigned. A working Group member need not necessarily be a respective of one of the organizations
of the ARAC. Individuals who have expertise in the subject matter and wish to become a member of the Working Group should
write the person listed under the caption, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, expressing that desire, describing their interest in the task, and the expertise they would bring to the working
group. The request will be reviewed by the ARAC Assistant Chair for Noise Certification and the Chair of the Working
Group, and the individual will be advised if the request can be granted. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Secretary of Transportation has determined that the formation and use of the ARAC are necessary and in the public
interest, in connection with the performance of duties of the FAA. Meetings of the ARAC to consider noise certification
issues will be open to the public, except as authorized by section 10(d) of the Federal Advisory Committee Act. Meetings
of the FAR/JAR Harmonization Working Group for Helicopters will not be open to the public, except to the extent that
individuals with an interest and expertise are selected to participate. No public announcement of Working Group
meetings will be made.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
The purpose of the alteration is to bring the existing Privacy Act notice into compliance with the requirements of
the Privacy Act, as amended. The alteration increases the number of locations at which records of the public transportation
incentive program are kept, identifies the system manager responsible for the records of the Office of Inspector
General, and discloses the address for notification and access to the records. The Office of Inspector General will
be maintaining records pertaining to its employees who have applied for, and those who have been accepted as participants
in, the Public Transportation Incentive Program (PTI Program). The records ensure that only one fare incentive per
month is available to eligible employees. The records are also used to generate reports on changes in the participants'
commuting methods.

Guidelines
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The program is designed for Eastern European and NIS scholars who are teaching at the university level in humanities
and social science fields of American studies, broadly defined, such as American history, law, demography, literature,
sociology, or political science. Participants should be chosen through a public, open competition which includes
U.S. professional peer review for the final selection of participants. Selections should be made and announced in
reasonable time for applicants to make plans for absence from their countries and to undertake departure formalities.
USIA (E/AAS) and all posts in countries from which scholars are selected should be informed of the final selection.
Proposals should demonstrate extensive contacts with and knowledge of Eastern European and NIS universities to
ensure that the best possible candidates are recruited and selected. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Fellowships should be six to twelve months in duration. Family members may accompany recipients for part of the grant
period, but not for a period exceeding six months. The fellowships provide for all costs of the recipients and accompanying
dependents, with due account being taken of any continuing university salary transferable into U.S. dollars that
recipients might be receiving.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Grantee will arrange appropriate placement in U.S. universities and research institutions for participants. To

Grantee will make all administrative arrangements, including travel, visa, disbursement of grant funds, insurance
and related matters. The grantee should maintain contact with the participants and liaison with university hosts
during the course of the grant to offer assistance with participant administrative concerns such as housing, travel
within the U.S., or emergency matters. Grantee will develop evaluation instruments and procedures to determine
the participants' scholarly activity during the course of the grant, the adequacy of the stipend, and the adequacy
of grantee and university administrative arrangements. Participants should also report on their general impressions
of the U.S. and how they intend to apply the materials or new information gained during the fellowship in their professional
work in their own countries. The grantee will establish procedures for follow-up communication with grantees to
ascertain the application of their fellowship activity to their professional responsibilities, such as new publications,
workshop leadership, new positions, or new course offerings stemming from their fellowship experience.

SUMMARY: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
The Office of Citizen Exchange (E/P) of the Bureau of Educational and Cultural Affairs announces a competitive grants
program for nonprofit organizations to develop initiative grant projects on the theme of rule of law for audiences
in selected African countries. Two separate projects are detailed below for judicial training and public defender
training. USIA is particularly seeking projects linking American legal institutions and specialists with partners
in Africa. Interested organizations are welcome to submit proposals for one or both projects; if submitting for both,
each project should have a separate proposal.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 -->
BACKGROUND:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 Many African countries are striving to create and institutionalize more democratic polities by establishing multi-party
systems, writing new constitutions, holding free elections, creating new legal systems and making a variety of political
and economic reforms. The highest priority of U.S. Missions in Africa is supporting democratization, of which one
crucial aspect is the growth of strong legal systems and legal institutions firmly committed to the rule of law.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The two projects described in this announcement are intended to engage American legal professionals, particularly
judges, public defenders and training institutions, in working with African counterparts to enhance the professionalism
and efficiency of the judiciary and to create or greatly expand public defender and legal aid services in the target
countries. The projects should also promote long-term linkages between American and African institutions.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

The U.S. consultants who will travel to Africa will be selected by the grantee institution in consultation with USIA.
The grantee should provide the names of American participants and brief, relevant biographical data. American participants
should be selected on the basis of their experience and expertise in the thematic field. Experience in communicating
to foreign audiences and general knowledge of Africa and of the countries involved in the project are highly desirable.

Recommended Program Structure
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The following suggestions should not serve as a blueprint, but as a stimulus for the development of an original program
design.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Phase One: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The program could begin with a 3&hyph;4 week U.S. study tour for a group of approximately 10&hyph;12 judges representing
the target countries. The study tour should allow the African jurists to visit several locations in the U.S. and should
include cultural activities as well as the following professional components:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 02 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=15 g=1 f=1 -->
_A series of field visits to familiarize the visiting jurists with the operations of courts and other legal institutions
such as bar associations, law schools, and legal training organizations;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
_An intensive visit of several days duration to a state court system which is of a scale similar to the national courts
of the target countries;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
_Formal judicial training to address the program themes in both the constitutional and court administration areas;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
_A concluding session to evaluate the study tour, make plans for the follow-up visit of American specialists to Africa,
and discuss needs for the specialized support materials to be provided with grant funds.

<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Phase Two: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
One or more American judges, judicial training specialists and/or experienced court administrators would visit
each of the target countries for consultations, workshops or other activities with local counterparts. Ideally,
the Americans would work closely with Africans who participated in Phase One to build on that earlier phase. For example,
they might collaborate to train and to plan professional development programs for many others. One approach might
be for the Americans and their Phase One African partners to conduct week-long workshops for 10&hyph;20 African judges
on selected constitutional or court management issues; another approach might be to convene 10&hyph;20 African
judges to begin designing a country-specific professional development program of coursework and practical experience
and technical progress. In planning these follow-up activities, the grantee should work closely with the African
participants in the U.S. study tour and with U.S. Information Service personnel in Africa to ensure that the activities
are tailored to meet the needs of the African countries.

African Public Defender and Legal Aid Training Exchange
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
USIA will accept proposals for a two-way exchange project to foster the development of public defender and legal aid
services in Ethiopia, Tanzania, Uganda and Zambia, and to promote linkages between legal professionals in the U.S.
and these countries for this purpose. USIA will consider providing funding up to approximately $200,000, of which
$10,000 must be devoted to developing or purchasing specialized support materials for participating African institutions.
For technical information, interested organizations may contact E/P Program Specialist Charlotte Peterson at

Project Objectives
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
1. Introduce African participants to the U.S. legal system and the principles on which it is founded, particularly
the rule of law and the power of courts to overrule actions of the Executive and Legislative branches, and compare the
U.S. legal system with those of the target countries;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. Examine the organizational structure and administrative operation of public defender and legal aid organizations
in the U.S., and explore how U.S. models might be adapted for use in the target countries;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. Explore techniques of alternative dispute resolution and sentencing alternatives such as probation and community
service;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. Provide a formal training component for the dual purpose of benefiting the individual visiting public defenders
and legal aid attorneys, and of enabling them to develop or enhance training programs for colleagues in their home
countries;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
5. Discuss the primary constitutional issues affecting criminal cases, including due process, equal protection,
rules of evidence, and criminal procedure;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
6. Explore strategies and modalities for challenging governmental actions, including test cases and class action
lawsuits;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
7. Promote long-term linkages between African public defenders and legal aid organizations and their counterparts
in the U.S. in order to foster dialogue on issues of common concern and to enhance the institutional capabilities of
the African organizations;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
8. Develop and/or purchase specialized support materials for participating institutions in each of the target countries.
Such materials might include but are not limited to legal reference and research books, training videos, textbooks
or other instructional materials. Grant monies of $10,000 must be used for this purpose.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
Participants
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The African participants will be attorneys active in public defense work and/or legal aid in their countries, or seeking
to establish such services. Participants will be nominated through coordination among U.S. Information Service
personnel in the target countries, USIA, and the African partner institutions. All participants must have strong
English-language skills.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The U.S. consultants who will travel to Africa will be selected by the grantee institution in consultation with USIA.
The grantee should provide the names of American participants and brief, relevant biographical data. American participants
should be selected on the basis of their experience and expertise in the thematic field. Experience in communicating
to foreign audiences and general knowledge of Africa and of the countries involved in the project are highly desirable.

_An initial orientation to the U.S. legal system and the constitution on which it is founded;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
_A series of field visits to familiarize the visiting lawyers with the operations of courts and other legal institutions
such as bar associations, law schools, and legal training facilities;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
_Field visits and consultations with NGOs wholly or partly dedicated to legal aid, including organizations focused
on civil rights, consumer protection and public interest issues such as the environment;

<!-- PJG ITAG l=15 g=1 f=1 -->
_Intensive visits of several days duration to public defender or legal aid organizations representing at least two
different organizational approaches to provision of legal services. Participants might be divided into two or more
small groups for this portion of the program. For example, those focused on criminal defense might spend a few days
with a large-city public defender's office and then travel to a smaller community which provides public defenders
through a system of appointing private-practice attorneys. Those participants interested primarily in legal aid
in civil cases might visit a single city to observe the various organizations providing legal aid such as legal aid
societies, NGOs devoted to civil rights or public interest practice, and law school clinical programs;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
_Formal training in such areas as trial advocacy skills, for the benefit of the visiting attorneys and to demonstrate
training techniques they might establish for colleagues in their home countries;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
_A concluding session to evaluate the study tour, make plans for the follow-up visit of American specialists to Africa,
develop a framework for institutional linkages between African public defender/legal aid organizations and American
counterpart institutions, and discuss needs for the specialized support materials to be provided with grant funds.

Phase Two: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
One or more American attorneys specializing in criminal defense or legal aid services would visit each of the target
countries for consultations, workshops or other activities with local counterparts. In planning these follow-up
activities, the grantee should work closely with the African participants in the U.S. study tour and with U.S. Information
Service personnel in Africa to ensure that the activities are tailored to meet the needs of the African countries.
Ideally, the Americans and their African partners would use this phase to involve many more African lawyers and to
design or launch projects which continue after this phase.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
Additional Guidelines and Restrictions
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
USIA is interested in supporting programs which will lay the groundwork for new and continuing relationships between
American and African legal institutions. Proposals which are overly ambitious and those which are very general will
not be competitive. Therefore, institutions should provide strong evidence of their ability to accomplish a few
tasks exceptionally well.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Bureau grants are not given to support projects whose focus is limited to technical issues, or for research projects,
developing publications for dissemination in the United States, individual student exchanges, film festivals,
or exhibits. Neither does the Office of Citizen Exchanges provide scholarships or support for long-term (a semester
or more) academic studies. Competitions sponsored by other Bureau offices are also announced in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 and may have different application requirements as well as different objectives.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
Programmatic Considerations
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Pursuant to the legislation authorizing the Bureau of Educational and Cultural Affairs, programs must maintain
a nonpolitical character and should be balanced and representative of the diversity of American political, social
and cultural life.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
USIA will give priority to proposals from U.S. organizations with relevant institutional contacts in the countries
involved in the projects described above. Partner institutions are encouraged to provide cost-sharing or significant
in-kind contributions such as local housing and transportation, interpreting, translating and other local currency
costs. These institutions are also encouraged to assist with the organization of various program activities.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The grantee will be responsible for most arrangements associated with this program. These include selecting speakers,
themes, and topics for discussion; organizing a coherent progression of activities; making all arrangements associated
with the African follow-up portion of the program; providing international and domestic travel arrangements for
all participants; making lodging and local transportation arrangements for visitors; orienting and debriefing
participants; preparing any necessary support materials; and working with host institutions and individuals to
achieve maximum program effectiveness.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
At the start of the U.S. portion of a program, the grantee should conduct an orientation session for the visiting delegation
which addresses substantive details of the program as well as geographic, historical, and cross-cultural factors
which they should consider to enhance program success.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
At the conclusion of each phase, the grantee institution will conduct participant evaluations and submit to E/P a
progress report. Upon conclusion of the program the grantee will be required to submit a report to E/P summarizing
results of the entire program including project outcomes, anticipated follow-on activities, and any resulting
institutional linkages.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Program monitoring and oversight will be provided by appropriate USIA elements. Per Diem support from host institutions
during an internship component is strongly encouraged. However, for all programs which include internships, a nonprofit
grantee institution which receives funds from corporate or other cosponsors should then use those monies to provide
food, lodging, and pocket money for the participants. In no case could the intern receive a wage or be hired by the sponsoring
institution. Internships should also have an American studies/values orientation component at the beginning of
the exchange program in the U.S. Grantee institutions should try to maximize cost-sharing in all facets of their program
design, and to stimulate U.S. private sector (foundation and corporate) support.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
USIS officers in participating countries will facilitate the issuance of visas and other program-related materials.

Funding 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Organizations with less than four years of successful experience in managing international exchange programs are
limited to $60,000. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Competition for USIA funding support is keen. The final selection of a grantee institution will depend on assessment
of proposals according to the review criteria delineated below. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
While applicants must provide an all-inclusive budget with the proposal, they are also encouraged to include separate
sub-budgets for each program component, phase, location or activity. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The recipient's proposal shall include the cost of an audit that: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Complies with the requirements of OMB Circular No. A&hyph;133, Audits of Institutions of Higher Education and
Other Nonprofit Institutions; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Complies with the requirements of American Institute of Certified Public Accountants (AICPA) Statement of Position
(SOP) No. 92&hyph;9; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Includes review by the recipient's independent auditor of a recipient-prepared supplemental schedule of indirect
cost rate computation, if such a rate is being proposed. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The audit costs shall be identified separately for: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Preparation of basic financial statements and other accounting services; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Preparation of the supplemental reports and schedules required by OMB Circular No. A&hyph;133, AICPA SOP 92&hyph;9,
and the review of the supplemental schedule of indirect cost rate computation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
USIA will consider funding the following project costs: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. International and domestic air fares; visas; transit costs (e.g., airport taxes); ground transportation costs.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Per diem: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
For the U.S. program, organizations have the option of using a flat $140/day for international participants or the
published Federal Travel Regulations per diem rates for individual American cities. NOTE: U.S. escorting staff
must use the published federal per diem rates, not the flat rate. For activities overseas, the Standard Government
Travel Regulations per diem rates must be used. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Book and cultural allowance: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Participants are entitled to a one-time cultural allowance of $150 per person, plus a book allowance of $50. Escorts
are reimbursed for actual cultural expenses up to $150. U.S. staff do not get these benefits. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Consultants: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
May be used to provide specialized expertise or to make presentations. Honoraria generally do not exceed $250 per
day. Subcontracting organizations may also be used, in which case the written contract(s) must be included in the
proposal. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
5. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Room rental: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
generally should not exceed $250 per day. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Materials development: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Proposals may contain costs to purchase, develop and translate materials for participants, in addition to the specialized
support materials to be provided to African institutions. USIA reserves the rights to these materials for future
use. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
7. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
One working meal per project: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Per capita cost may not exceed $5&hyph;8 per lunch and $14&hyph;20 per dinner, excluding room rental. The number of
invited guests may not exceed the number of participants by more than a factor of two to one. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
8.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
 Return travel allowance: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
$70 for each participant which is to be used for incidental expenditures incurred during international travel. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
9. Other costs necessary for the effective administration of the program, including salaries for grant organization
employees, benefits, and other direct and indirect costs per detailed instructions in the application package.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
E/P encourages cost-sharing, which may be in the form of allowable direct or indirect costs. E/P would be especially
interested in proposals which demonstrate a program vision which goes well beyond that which can be supported by the
requested USIA grant and which would try to use a USIA grant to leverage additional funding from other sources to support
elements of the broader program plan. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Recipient must maintain written records to support all allowable costs which are claimed as being its contribution
to cost participation, as well as costs to be paid by the Federal government. Such records are subject to audit. The
basis for determining the value of cash and in-kind contributions must be in accordance with OMB Circular A&hyph;110,
Attachment E., ``Cost-sharing and Matching,'' and should be described in the proposal. In the event the Recipient
does not meet the minimum amount of cost-sharing as stipulated in the Recipient's budget, the Agency's contribution
will be reduced in proportion to the Recipient's contribution. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Please note: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
All delegates will be covered under the terms of a USIA-sponsored health insurance policy. The premium is paid by USIA
directly to the insurance company.

 The Secretary updates the list of the Department's direct grant programs and fellowship programs under which the
Secretary is making new awards for fiscal year (FY) 1994 and estimates the deadline dates for the transmittal of applications
for those programs for which application notices have not yet been published. The Secretary also revises the list
of State Single Points of Contact (SPOCs) for programs subject to the requirements of Executive Order 12372 (Intergovernmental
Review of Federal Programs). The notice is intended to help potential applicants in planning for the remainder of
this fiscal year.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 On September 24, 1993, the Secretary published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 (58 FR 50138) the Department's 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
annual combined application notice (CAN). That notice listed almost all of the direct grant and fellowship programs
under which the Secretary planned to make new awards in FY 1994 and included the application notices for many of those
programs. The list included some programs for which application notices had not yet been published. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Since publication of the CAN, additional application notices have been published. In addition, on February 11, 1994,
the Secretary published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (59 FR 6826) a notice extending application deadline dates for certain programs. The Secretary took this action to
assist potential applicants who may have been adversely affected by severe weather conditions in various parts of
the Nation or by the earthquake in California. Also, since publication of the CAN, some new programs have been added,
and some other programs have been withdrawn or replaced. The Secretary therefore determined that publication of
an update would be useful to the educational community. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This notice, therefore, lists all FY 1994 programs previously announced in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, including those for which the deadline dates have already passed, as well as FY 1994 programs to be announced at a later
date. As is the case with the CAN, this notice is designed to assist potential applicants in planning projects and activities.
However, to expedite publication of this update, the Secretary has decided not to include any individual application
notices. Application notices are published separately in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. If additional competitions are carried out in FY 1994 because of events not known at this time, the Secretary will
announce those competitions in future issues of the

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As an appendix to the CAN of September 24, 1993, the Secretary published a list of State Single Points of Contact (SPOCs)
for programs subject to Executive Order 12372 and the regulations in 34 CFR part 79. Since publication of that list,
the names or addresses of SPOCs in a few States have changed. Therefore, as an appendix to this update, the Secretary
is publishing a revised listing of SPOCs.

National Education Goals 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
On March 31, 1994, the President signed into law the Goals 2000: Educate America Act (Pub. L. 103&hyph;227). The Act
enunciates eight National Education Goals for the year 2000: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Goal 1:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 All children in America will start school ready to learn. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Goal 2:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The high school graduation rate will increase to at least 90 percent. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Goal 3:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 All students will leave grades 4, 8, and 12 having demonstrated competency in challenging subject matter, including
English, mathematics, science, foreign languages, civics and government, economics, arts, history, and geography;
and every school in America will ensure that all students learn to use their minds well, so they may be prepared for responsible
citizenship, further learning, and productive employment in our Nation's modern economy.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Nation's teaching force will have access to programs for the continued improvement of their professional skills
and the opportunity to acquire the knowledge and skills needed to instruct and prepare all American students for the
next century. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

and exercise the rights and responsibilities of citizenship. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Goal 7:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Every school in the United States will be free of drugs, violence, and the unauthorized presence of firearms and alcohol
and will offer a disciplined environment conducive to learning. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Goal 8:

Applicability of Section 5301 of the Anti-Drug Abuse Act of 1988 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A number of programs listed in the chart provide that a grant, fellowship, traineeship, or other monetary benefit
may be awarded to an individual. This award may be made to the individual either directly by the Department or by a grantee
that receives Federal funds for the purpose of providing, for example, fellowships, traineeships, or other awards
to individuals. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 5301 of the Anti-Drug Abuse Act of 1988 (Pub. L. 100&hyph;690; 21 U.S.C. 862) provides that a sentencing court
may deny eligibility for certain Federal benefits to an individual convicted of drug trafficking or possession.
Thus, an individual who applies for a grant, fellowship, or other monetary benefit under a program covered by this
notice should understand that, if convicted of drug trafficking or possession, he or she is subject to denial of eligibility
for that benefit if the sentencing court imposes such a sanction. This denial applies whether the Federal benefit
is provided to the individual directly by the Department or is provided through a grant, fellowship, traineeship,
or other award made available with Federal funds by a grantee. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Any persons determined to be ineligible for Federal benefits under the provisions of section 5301 are listed in the
General Services Administration's ``Lists of Parties Excluded from Federal Procurement or Nonprocurement Programs.''

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
Applicability of the Federal Debt Collection Procedures Act of 1990 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The programs listed in the chart make discretionary awards subject to the eligibility requirements of the Federal
Debt Collection Procedures Act of 1990 (Pub. L. 101&hyph;647; 28 U.S.C. 3201). The Act provides that if there is a judgment
lien against a debtor's property for a debt to the United States, the debtor is not eligible to receive a Federal grant
or loan, except direct payments to which the debtor is entitled as beneficiary, until the judgment is paid in full or
otherwise satisfied.

This appendix applies to each program that is subject to the requirements of Executive Order 12372 (Intergovernmental
Review of Federal Programs) and the regulations in 34 CFR part 79. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The objective of the Executive order is to foster an intergovernmental partnership and to strengthen federalism
by relying on State and local processes for State and local government coordination and review of proposed Federal
financial assistance. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Applicants must contact the appropriate State Single Point of Contact to find out about, and to comply with, the State's
process under Executive Order 12372. Applicants proposing to perform activities in more than one State should immediately
contact the Single Point of Contact for each of those States and follow the procedure established in each of those States
under the Executive order. A listing containing the Single Point of Contact for each State is included in this appendix.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In States that have not established a process or chosen a program for review, State, areawide, regional, and local
entities may submit comments directly to the Department. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Any State Process Recommendation and other comments submitted by a State Single Point of Contact and any comments
from State, areawide, regional, and local entities must be mailed or hand-delivered by the date indicated in this
notice to the following address: The Secretary, EO 12372_CFDA

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The goal of the Eisenhower National Program is to support projects of national significance in elementary and secondary
schools in mathematics and science education designed to improve the skills of teachers and the quality of instruction
in these areas and to increase the access of all students to that instruction. The program is authorized under Title
II, Part A, Subpart 1, section 2012 of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965, as amended. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Secretary may subsequently conduct an external study or studies of the effectiveness and lessons learned from
projects funded under this program. If he does so, projects will be required to cooperate with the conduct of the study,
by sharing their experiences, project evaluations, and data. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Regarding priority 1, the Secretary believes that technology can be used to improve instruction and assessment in
mathematics and science and provide all students with greater opportunity to learn in accordance with state content
and student performance standards. The Secretary believes that developments in technology have great promise for
helping to attain National Education Goal Five, that by the Year 2000, United States students will be first in the world
in mathematics and science achievement; however, he sees ample evidence that many teachers are not confident about
using these resources in the classroom. The scope of these projects may include professional development in the use
of technology for assessment of student learning. For purposes of substantiating that two or more schools assisted
under this priority serve underachieving students, the applicant may cite test scores, drop-out rates, Chapter
I eligibility, or similar indices. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Regarding priority 2, the Secretary is concerned that the Nation's schools encourage too few minority and female
students to study and pursue careers in the fields of mathematics and science. The Secretary believes that the well-documented
underrepresentation of minorities and women in these disciplines represents a waste of human talent that the Nation
can ill afford. This priority will therefore support, and learn from, projects that seek to stimulate and sustain
the interest and attainments of female and minority children in mathematics and science. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Regarding priority 3, the Secretary believes that environmental education can stimulate students' interest in
scientific fields and enhance their understanding of these disciplines. The Secretary also believes that environmental
issues are important in their own right and are, therefore, eminently worthy of study. The Secretary finds, however,
that environmental education programs of high quality are available in too few of the Nation's schools, in part because
American teachers have very limited opportunities to increase their knowledge of environmental issues and to learn
the most successful means of providing environmental education. The Secretary proposes, therefore, to support
and learn from projects in professional development for teachers in environmental education. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Secretary draws to the attention of potential applicants responding to priority 3 the National Consortium for
Environmental Education and Training (NCEET) at the University of Michigan, an undertaking funded by the Environmental
Protection Agency under Section 5 of the National Environmental Education Act of 1990. NCEET's primary emphasis
is professional development for teachers in environmental education. Potential applicants should consult with
NCEET to ensure that their projects are not duplicative of the National Consortium's efforts. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

On November 12, 1993, the Secretary announced in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (58 FR 60007) a proposed priority for the Eisenhower National Program in model professional development in the use
of technology for mathematics and science instruction. After considering the intent of the Senate Report that accompanied
the Fiscal Year 1994 Department of Education Appropriations Act, the Secretary proposed two additional priorities.
These proposed priorities were announced on February 28, 1994 in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

Comment:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 One commenter pointed out that technology projects are hardware intensive. The commenter therefore suggested that
the portion of grant funding available for purchase or lease of appropriate hardware, software, and communications
services or tariffs for use in these projects be greater than is traditionally available in many grants. Another commenter
urged that the Department allow up to 50% of the total Federal portion of the project budget, rather than the 20% stipulated
in the priority, to be used for purchase of items such as hardware. This commenter believed that this change would result
in greater numbers of applications from districts that have relatively few resources for the purchase of technology.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Discussion:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 In this priority the Secretary wishes to emphasize professional development, rather than equipment purchase, and
thus does not wish to reduce the proportion of Federal funds available for inservice education. The Secretary notes
that, in their efforts to obtain additional funds to be used for purchase of hardware, software, and other such items,
applicants should have available the joint resources of the partnerships that are to be formed under this priority.
The Secretary acknowledges, however, that the type of projects to be supported under this priority may require a significant
initial investment in technology-related resources. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Changes: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The priority has been revised to state that up to one-third of the total Federal funds approved for year one and up to
15 percent of the Federal funds approved in years two and three may be expended to purchase or lease hardware, software,
and communications services or tariffs.

Comment: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
One commenter urged that a portion of funds made available through this priority be used for preservice programs,
such as those that would help faculty in schools of education to provide exemplary models of the use of technology in
teaching. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Discussion: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Secretary agrees that preservice programs can play a critical role in preparing teachers to use technology effectively
in the classroom. The current priority, however, was designed for inservice professional development, where ample
need for improvement exists. Given the relatively limited amount of funding available for these priorities, the
Secretary does not wish to dilute the purpose or effectiveness of the priority by broadening it to encompass preservice
programs. The Secretary will, however, examine possible opportunities to support preservice programs in future
technology-related grant priorities.

Comment: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
One commenter suggested that partnerships formed to develop and implement project activities include representatives
of the Statewide Systemic Initiative (SSI) program funded by the National Science Foundation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Discussion: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Secretary believes that, insofar as the SSI program involves professional development, this comment is already
addressed in the priority's requirement that projects coordinate their work with other professional development
efforts in mathematics and science education.

Comment: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
One commenter urged that principals be allowed to designate persons knowledgeable in technology to serve in the principal's
stead on the advisory committees that will guide the projects. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Discussion: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Secretary points out that the priority does not preclude participation on the advisory committees by persons
who have been chosen by principals and who are particularly knowledgeable in technology. The Secretary believes
that the presence of a principal himself or herself on an advisory committee represents a personal commitment that
could be vital to the undertaking's success. In addition, in light of the many-faceted professional development
activities envisioned in the priority, the Secretary believes that the advisory committee 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
needs the breadth of knowledge and management perspectives that principals can bring.

Comment: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
One commenter suggested that the priority require the participation of teachers of English as a second language (ESL)
to enhance the effectiveness of the program in schools serving underachieving students whose native language is
not English. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Discussion: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Secretary notes that the priority allows for inclusion of ESL teachers in project activities. The priority requires
the involvement of two or more schools serving underachieving students and the inclusion of the majority of, if not
all, the mathematics and science teachers in participating schools. ESL teachers who provide instruction in mathematics
and science at project site schools are thus likely to participate in the professional development activities that
are part of the project. In the interest of allowing the greatest amount of flexibility and variety in the projects
that are funded, the Secretary does not wish to add further requirements concerning inclusion of teachers.

Comment: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
One commenter pointed out that technology provides the teacher with an opportunity to assess each student's learning
on a near-continuous basis, thus enabling the teacher to adjust instruction to fit the needs of both individual learners
and groups of students throughout the course of a learning sequence. Technology can thus maximize the usefulness
of assessment by making it an integral part of learning, the commenter argued. The commenter urged that the priority
be expanded to include attention to the use of technology for student assessment aimed at continuous monitoring and
improvement of learning.

The Secretary recognizes that technology can provide improved methods of assessing student progress and thus can
contribute to student learning. The Secretary does not exclude teacher professional development in the use of technology
for student assessment.

One commenter strongly supported the emphasis on women and minorities, as well as the emphasis on environmental education.
The commenter also suggested adding a priority, or mentioning the possibility of, the development and incorporation
of service learning in projects.

Comment: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Two commenters strongly argued against limiting one priority to environmental education. They felt that it is unnecessary
and unwise to focus limited funding for professional development on a particular field of science. One commenter
stated that most teachers teach more than one science and therefore need reinforcement in more than one field. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Discussion: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Secretary believes that environmental education is one way to stimulate students' interest in scientific fields.
The Secretary also believes that environmental education involves several different scientific fields and will
therefore enhance teachers' ability to teach science generally.

Comment: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
One commenter supported the encouragement of women and minorities in mathematics and science. However, the commenter
urged that the priority provide opportunities and funds for selected projects to do controlled studies, with longer
term follow up of their impact. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Discussion: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Secretary requires these projects to evaluate lessons learned about promoting the interest and attainment of
women and minorities in mathematics and science and expects the findings to be widely disseminated. This requirement
does not preclude the use of controlled evaluation studies for these purposes. However, projects funded under this
priority must be ``model'' projects designed themselves to stimulate and sustain the interest and attainments of
females and minority children in mathematics and science. The Secretary will not support projects under this priority
which are solely for the purpose of conducting research and evaluation in this area.

Comment: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
One commenter strongly supported programs attracting females and minorities to careers in mathematics and science.
However, referencing the Senate report language cited in the February 28, 1994, Notice of Proposed Priority issued
by the Eisenhower National Program, the commenter questioned the Secretary's intent to fund the priority on environmental
education because it would dilute Congressional intent to respond to the needs of women and minorities in mathematics
and science, and in any event mathematics and science high schools would be teaching environmental education. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Discussion: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Secretary believes the commenter overlooked a provision of the Senate report directing the Department of Education
to support work in environmental education.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Under 34 CFR 75.105(c)(3) the Secretary proposes to give an absolute preference to applications that meet one of the
following priorities. Each application shall respond to 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
only one
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 of the three priorities, although an applicant could submit more than one application to respond to more than one priority.
The Secretary funds under this competition only applications that meet one of these absolute priorities: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Secretary announces an absolute priority for fiscal years 1994 and 1995 under the Fund for Innovation in Education
(FIE): Innovation in Education Program to support innovative projects that provide K&hyph;12 teachers and other
educators with sustained, high quality professional development opportunities that are aligned with challenging
content and professional standards developed at the national, State or local levels. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The intent of this priority is to enable school educators, working with appropriate university, community, and business
partners, to create and maintain model learning environments that will help all students in elementary and secondary
schools achieve challenging academic standards in subjects such as English, mathematics, science, history, geography,
civics, foreign languages, economics, and the arts.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 An essential step in achieving our National Education Goals is ensuring that we have high academic expectations for

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=3 -->
all
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 students and that each student has the opportunity to fulfill those expectations. Current national, State, and local
efforts to define high standards for what students should know and be able to do in the various subject areas provide
a starting point for creating the type of learning opportunities that an education system of excellence must provide
for all members of an increasingly diverse student population. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In order to provide learning opportunities where more rigorous and complex learning is expected of 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
all
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 students, teachers will need high-quality, career-long professional development programs. Other educators who
help to create teaching and learning environments that better serve the academic and other needs of students will
need similar high-quality professional development opportunities. Such educators might include school and district
administrators, school and university-based teacher educators, curriculum and supervisory personnel, paraprofessionals/instructional
aides, and members of school boards. To provide effective professional development programs for teachers and other
educators, applicants must ensure that their proposed projects are aligned with high standards for student learning.
Applicants should also consider related standards for teacher effectiveness and for the preparation, credentialling
and continuing development of educators. More specifically, in designing policies and practices for professional
development, applicants are urged to draw on relevant work, as appropriate, from groups such as the National Board
for Professional Teaching Standards, the Interstate New Teacher Assessment and Support Consortium, the National
Council for the Accreditation of Teacher Education, and the National Staff Development Council. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Secretary recognizes that successful well-articulated programs that provide for continuous improvement of
professional educators from recruitment to retirement will require educators to work together across traditionally
separated roles and organizations. Therefore, projects must be carried out by partnerships. Finally, the design
of professional development efforts must incorporate what is known about developing and managing high-performance
school systems that support educational excellence and equity. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Secretary proposes to direct financial assistance to projects that develop new or further develop existing innovative
partnerships of school, university, community, and other entities to establish and maintain high-quality, standards-based
professional development programs for teachers and other educators. The purpose of these partnerships may be to
improve the entire continuum of professional development or to focus on one or more points along that continuum (e.g.,
preservice, induction, inservice). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In accordance with recommendations in the Senate Report that accompanied the Fiscal Year 1994 Department of Education
Appropriation Act, the Secretary supports development of programs based on existing strategies, such as creating
model professional development schools, or applicants' newly designed strategies. The Secretary also recognizes
the need for professional development efforts, as identified in the Senate Report, that prepare educators for working
with other human service professionals to address non-academic student/family problems (e.g., drugs, violence,
nutrition, unemployment) as well as other conditions that place students at-risk for failure in school. The Secretary
is particularly interested in projects that provide relevant professional development opportunities for educators
who work in urban school communities. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Secretary strongly encourages the development of challenging and feasible school-based collaborations that
are based upon appropriate research results and exemplary teaching and professional development practices, as
well as the contributions of expert school, higher education, and community practitioners. Emphases might include
collegial strategies such as in-school mentoring for teachers; school-university teams integrating teacher preparation
and school curriculum to effectively educate at-risk students; teacher sabbaticals to work in model schools; and
practitioner-led inquiry and reform activities.

Comments: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
One commenter recommends that the priority require projects to include representatives from State Boards of Education
on the advisory committee since States set the standards and policies that serve as frameworks for professional development.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Three commenters recommend that the priority use more explicit language to identify the ``other'' potential project
partners. One commenter believes the priority should explicitly identify national organizations or associations
as potential partners or applicants. Another commenter requests the inclusion of non-profit organizations.

One commenter requests that the National Staff Development Council (NSDC) be cited as a resource to applicants on
staff development standards in the Supplementary Information section of the priority. This same commenter encouraged
inclusion of the NSDC's Standards for Staff Development under the Required Activities Section of the priority.

Discussion: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Secretary recognizes that many organizations have already developed and recommended, or are in the process of
developing and recommending guidelines and standards for professional development. The NSDC is a national organization
representing a key professional development audience and can appropriately be included as an example in the Supplementary
Information section of the priority. The priority requires that projects consider the applicability of several
types of standards, including those for teacher preparation and continuing development. The Secretary does not
wish to specify particular documents or sources in the text of the priority.

Two commenters find the examples of possible ways to build upon existing strategies listed in the Supplementary Information
section of the priority either too limiting or not specific enough, e.g., model professional development school,
model school, and teacher sabbaticals.

Projects that design and implement innovative, high quality, standards-based preservice, induction and/or inservice
professional development programs for K&hyph;12 teachers and other educators. Each project must involve one or
more local education agencies (LEAs) working in partnership with one or more institutions of higher education (IHEs)
and others such as State education officials and representatives from professional organizations, private schools,
arts and cultural organizations, business, and the community, as appropriate. Programs and activities must be built
upon relevant and current research including a demonstrated relationship between the professional development
approach and lessons learned from relevant research and exemplary practice. A grounding in research findings must
also be evident in the content of the professional development activities.

 students as developed through voluntary national, State, and/or local efforts in one or more subjects such as English,
mathematics, science, history, geography, civics, foreign languages, economics, and the arts. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

to the particular focus of the project. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
c. Establish an advisory committee composed of school and university practitioners; state education officials;

representatives; and others as appropriate. The advisory committee must guide the project activities to ensure
a systemic approach including cross-institutional planning, coordination, and resource allocation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
d. Evaluate the following aspects of the project: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. The degree to which the professional development content and strategies reflect relevant research and exemplary
practice; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. The degree to which the project activities were actually implemented as compared to the original design; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. The nature and impact of project outcomes related to improved teaching and increased student learning and development.
