SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 This interim final rule invites comments on the revision of the administrative rules and regulations of the marketing
order for Florida citrus. This rule redefines the term ``Special Purpose Shipper'' to mean those persons who handle
citrus fruit which is certified as organically grown under Florida law, and requires such persons to certify that
they will limit shipments of such fruit to outlets handling organically grown fruit. This rule more precisely defines
organically grown Florida citrus fruit, and may increase the market for organic shipments. This rule was unanimously
recommended by the Citrus Administrative Committee (committee), the agency responsible for local administration
of the marketing order.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 This interim final rule is issued under Marketing Agreement and Marketing Order No. 905 (7 CFR part 905) regulating
the handling of oranges, grapefruit, tangerines, and tangelos grown in Florida, hereinafter referred to as the order.
This order is effective under the Agricultural Marketing Agreement Act of 1937, as amended (7 U.S.C. 601&hyph;674),
hereinafter referred to as the Act. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Department of Agriculture (Department) is issuing this rule in conformance with Executive Order 12866. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This interim final rule has been reviewed under Executive Order 12778, Civil Justice Reform. This interim final rule
is not intended to have retroactive effect. This interim final rule will not preempt any state or local laws, regulations,
or policies, unless they present an irreconcilable conflict with this rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Act provides that administrative proceedings must be exhausted before parties may file suit in court. Under section
608c(15)(A) of the Act, any handler subject to an order may file with the Secretary a petition stating that the order,
any provision of the order, or any obligation imposed in connection with the order is not in accordance with law and
requesting a modification of the order or to be exempted therefrom. A handler is afforded the opportunity for a hearing
on the petition. After the hearing, the Secretary would rule on the petition. The Act provides that the district court
of the United States in any district in which the handler is an inhabitant, or has his or her principal place of business,
has jurisdiction in equity to review the Secretary's ruling on the petition, provided a bill in equity is filed not
later than 20 days after the date of the entry of the ruling. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Pursuant to the requirements set forth in the Regulatory Flexibility Act (RFA), the Administrator of the Agricultural
Marketing Service (AMS) has considered the economic impact of this action on small entities.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The purpose of the RFA is to fit regulatory actions to the scale of business subject to such actions in order that small
businesses will not be unduly or disproportionately burdened. Marketing orders issued pursuant to the Act, and rules
issued thereunder, are unique in that they are brought about through group action of essentially small entities acting
on their own behalf. Thus, both statutes have small entity orientation and compatibility. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
There are about 100 Florida citrus handlers subject to regulation under the marketing order covering oranges, grapefruit,
tangerines, and tangelos grown in Florida, and about 11,000 growers of these citrus fruits in Florida. Small agricultural
service firms have been defined by the Small Business Administration (13 CFR 121.601) as those having annual receipts
of less than $5,000,000, and small agricultural growers are defined as those whose annual receipts are less than $500,000.
A minority of these handlers and a majority of the growers may be classified as small entities. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The marketing order for Florida citrus provides for the establishment of minimum grade and size requirements. The
minimum grade and size requirements are designed to provide fresh markets with fruit of acceptable quality, thereby
maintaining consumer confidence for fresh Florida citrus. This helps create buyer confidence and contributes to
stable marketing conditions. This is in the interest of producers, packers, and consumers, and is designed to increase
returns to Florida citrus growers. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The cultural practices of producers of organically grown citrus differ from normal industry practices. Because
of these differences, organically grown fruit is usually required to meet a different grade standard under the marketing
order. This grade standard pertains only to the external characteristics of the fruit, not the internal quality.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The different grade standard is needed to facilitate the marketing of organic citrus. There are indications that
organically grown citrus, from a marketing standpoint, are a different commodity than conventionally grown citrus.
Organic citrus generally has higher external damage. Organic fruit for the most part is marketed differently, is
not mixed with non-organic fruit, appeals only to certain consumers, and is in many respects, a specialized commodity.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This action invites comments on changes to the administrative rules and regulations prescribed under the Florida
citrus marketing order. This rule more precisely defines organic fruit, and the type of market outlets which organically
grown fruit may be sold in, free from certain requirements imposed under the order. These changes were unanimously
recommended by the committee at its November 16, 1993 meeting.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Sections 905.146, 905.147, and 905.148 of the regulations provide terms and conditions under which shippers may
ship organically grown Florida citrus fruit, as Special Purpose Shippers, with a conditional release from certain
grade requirements issued under &sect;905.52 of the order. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
When the provisions concerning special purpose shipments were made effective in 1978, there were no laws governing
organic fruit and vegetable growers in Florida. A ``Special Purpose Shipper'' was defined under the marketing order
as one who had certified that they would handle only citrus fruit which they knew from their own personal knowledge
was produced on trees on which only compost, non-acidulated fertilizer such as rock phosphate, dolomite, or ground
limestone is used, and to which no chemical insecticide or fungicide had been applied. However, the State of Florida
now requires all organically grown fruits and vegetables to be certified. Accordingly, the committee has recommended
redefining the term ``Special Purpose Shipper'' in &sect;905.146 to mean a person who handles Florida citrus fruit
that is certified by a Florida Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services licensed certifying agent as organically
grown under Florida law. This definition reflects that organic fruit has been certified under Florida law, and also
provides additional assurance that shippers claiming organic status and utilizing the grade standards for organic
fruit qualify to do so. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under Florida law, the Florida Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services licenses independent third parties
to act as certifying agents. Growers who intend to sell organic fruit make an application to a certifying agent. The
certifying agent inspects and certifies a grower's acreage as being in accordance with Florida law and issues the
grower a certificate. The certificate number is transferred to a trip ticket which accompanies any shipments of fruit
grown on the certified acreage. When the handler receives the shipment, a copy of the trip ticket is provided to the
state inspector indicating that the fruit is certified organic and can be packed using the applicable organic grade
standards. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The committee also recommended that &sect;905.146 be revised to require Special Purpose Shippers to certify that
they will limit their shipments of organically grown citrus fruit to outlets handling organically grown fruits.
This replaces the requirement that only outlets registered and approved by the committee could receive such fruit
and ends the requirement that receivers of special purpose shipments complete the applicable sections of the Report
of Special Purpose Shipments form. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The language in &sect;905.146, 905.147, 905.148 concerning Certificates of Privilege is being revised for clarity,
and procedural safeguards are being added to &sect;905.147(c) dealing with suspensions or denials of Certificates
of Privilege. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This rule reflects the committee's and the Department's appraisal of the need to revise the exemption provisions
for special purpose shipments, as specified. The Departmental view is that this rule may have a beneficial impact
on growers and shippers of organic citrus fruit. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Based on the above, the Administrator of the AMS has determined that this rule will not have a significant economic
impact on a substantial number of small entities. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In accordance with the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (44 U.S.C. chapter 35), the information collection requirements
that are contained in this rule have been previously approved by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) and have
been assigned OMB number 0581&hyph;0094. This action will reduce the reporting burden on approximately 95 receivers
of special purpose shipments of Florida citrus completing a section of the Report of Special Purpose Shipments form,
taking about .04 hour to complete each report. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
After consideration of all relevant material presented, including the Committee's recommendation, and other available
information, it is found that this interim final rule, as hereinafter set forth, will tend to effectuate the declared
policy of the Act.

Pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 553, it is also found and determined, upon good cause, that it is impracticable, unnecessary and
contrary to the public interest to give preliminary notice prior to putting this rule into effect, and that good cause
exists for not postponing the effective date of this rule until 30 days after publication in the

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

 because: (1) This rule updates provisions in the regulations; (2) Florida citrus fruit handlers are aware of this
rule which was unanimously recommended by the committee at a public meeting and they will need no additional time to
comply with the revised requirements; (3) shipment of the 1993&hyph;94 season Florida citrus fruit crop is currently
in progress; and (4) the rule provides a 30-day comment period, and any comments received will be considered prior
to any finalization of this interim final rule.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(a) A Special Purpose Shipper is one who handles Florida citrus fruit that is certified by a Florida Department of Agriculture
and Consumer Services licensed certifying agent as organically grown under Florida law. In addition, the shipper
shall certify that shipments will be limited to outlets handling organically grown fruits. Any such shipments shall
be subject to a Certificate of Privilege issued by the committee. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) To qualify for a Certificate of Privilege, each such shipper must notify the committee prior to the first shipment
of certified organically grown Florida citrus fruit in the fiscal period of the shipper's intent to ship such citrus,
submit an application on forms supplied by the committee, and agree to other requirements as set forth in &sect;&sect;905.147
and 905.148 inclusive, with respect to such shipments. The shipper shall certify that no claims will be made, written
or verbal, concerning any alleged advantages of using, or any alleged superiority of, fruit shipped under a Certificate
of Privilege, compared to other Florida produced citrus. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) Citrus meeting all other applicable requirements may be handled without regard to grade regulations issued under
&sect;905.52 under the following conditions:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Such fruit meets requirements of the U.S. No. 2 Russet grade and those requirements of the U.S. No. 1 grade relating
to shape (form) as such requirements are set forth in the revised U.S. Standards for grades of Florida Oranges and Tangelos
(7 CFR 2851.1140 through 2851.1180), the revised U.S. Standards for Florida Tangerines (7 CFR 2851.8180 through
2851.1835), or the revised U.S. Standards for Grades of Florida Grapefruit (7 CFR 2851.750 through 2851.784). Such
fruit meets applicable minimum size requirements in effect for domestic shipments of citrus fruits.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) All such citrus shall be inspected as required by &sect;905.53 by the Federal or Federal-state Inspection Service
prior to the time such citrus is shipped from the packing facility, and certified as meeting the applicable requirements.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

(c) Suspension or Denial of Certificate of Privilege. The committee may investigate the handling of special purpose
shipments under Certificates of Privilege to determine whether Special Purpose Shippers are complying with the
requirements and regulations applicable to such certificates. Whenever the committee finds that a Special Purpose
Shipper or consignee is failing to comply with the requirements and regulations applicable to such certificates,
the Certificate of Privilege issued to such Special Purpose Shipper may be suspended or, in the case of an application
for the issuance of an initial Certificate of Privilege, may be denied. Such suspension of a certificate shall be for
a reasonable period of time as determined by 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the committee, but in no event shall it extend beyond the end of the current fiscal period. In the case of the denial of
an application for the issuance of an initial certificate, such certificate shall be denied until the applicant comes
into compliance with the requirements and regulations applicable to such certificates. Prior to suspending or denying
an application for a Certificate of Privilege, the committee shall give the shipper or applicant reasonable advance
notice in writing of its intention and the facts and reasons therefor, and afford the shipper or applicant an opportunity,
either orally or in writing, to present opposing facts and reasons. The shipper or applicant shall be informed of the
committee's determination in writing and in a timely manner.

or shippers; name and address of the certified organic Florida citrus fruit grower or growers supplying fruit for
such shipment; truck or other conveyance identification; the loading point; destination, consignee; the inspection
certificate number; and any other information deemed necessary by the committee.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) One copy of the report on each shipment shall be forwarded by the shipper to the committee within 10 days after such
shipment, and two copies of the report shall accompany each shipment to the receiver. Upon the receipt of each shipment,

SUMMARY: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
This action revises Class E airspace at Juneau and Dillingham, AK. The FAA is preparing to develop and test Differential
Global Positioning System (DGPS) instrument approach and departure procedures at the Juneau Airport. Additional
controlled airspace starting at 700 feet above the surface (AGL) is needed for instrument flight rules (IFR) departure
and arrival operations at the airport. Controlled airspace starting at 1200 feet AGL at Dillingham is being revised
so that recently developed instrument flight rule (IFR) holding patterns are in controlled airspace. The areas will
be depicted on aeronautical charts to provide a reference for pilots operating in the area.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

History
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
On February 23, 1994, the FAA proposed to amend part 71 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR part 71) to revise
Class E airspace at Juneau and Dillingham, AK. (59 FR 12876.) The FAA is preparing to develop DGPS instrument approach/departure
procedures for the Juneau Airport at Juneau, AK. The proposal was to revise the controlled airspace extending from
700 feet AGL in the Juneau area for IFR operations. Controlled airspace starting at 1200 feet AGL at Dillingham was
proposed to be revised so that recently developed IFR holding patterns are contained in controlled airspace.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Interested parties were invited to participate in this rulemaking proceeding by submitting written comments on
the proposal to the FAA. No objections to the proposal were received.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Airspace Reclassification, in effect as of September 16, 1993, has discontinued the use of the term ``transition
area,'' and controlled airspace extending upward from 700 or 1200 feet above ground level is now Class E airspace.
Class E airspace designations for airspace areas extending upward from 700 feet or more above ground level are published
in Paragraph 6005 of FAA Order 7400.9A dated June 17, 1993, and effective September 16, 1993, which is incorporated
by reference in 14 CFR 71.1 (58 FR 36298; July 6, 1993).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Class E airspace designation listed in this document will be published subsequently in the Order.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=2 -->
The Rule
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
These amendments to part 71 of the Federal Aviation Regulations revise Class E airspace at Juneau, AK, to provide controlled
airspace from 700 feet AGL for IFR DGPS arrival and departure procedures, and revise Class E airspace at Dillingham,
AK, to provide controlled airspace from 1200 feet AGL for recently developed IFR holding patterns.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FAA has determined that this regulation only involves an established body of technical regulations for which
frequent and routine amendments are necessary to keep them operationally current. It, therefore_(1) is not a ``significant
regulatory action'' under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under DOT Regulatory Policies
and Procedures (44 FR 11034; February 26, 1979); and (3) does not warrant preparation of a regulatory evaluation as
the anticipated impact is so minimal. Since this is a routine matter that will only affect air traffic procedures and
air navigation, it is certified that this rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number
of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
On March 15, 1994, the FAA proposed to amend part 71 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR part 71) to establish
Class E airspace at Ukiah, CA. (59 FR 14805). An AWOS has been installed at the Ukiah Municipal Airport, Ukiah, CA. The
proposal was to modify controlled airspace from 700 to 1200 feet AGL and to add controlled airspace extending from
the surface for IFR operations at Ukiah Municipal Airport.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Interested parties were invited to participate in this rulemaking proceedings by submitting written comments on
the proposal to the FAA. No objections were received concerning this proposal.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The coordinates in the proposal are based on North American Datum 83. Class E airspace designations are published
in Paragraphs 6002 and 6005 of FAA Order 7400.9A dated June 17, 1993, and effective September 16, 1993, which is incorporated
by reference in 14 CFR 71.1 (58 FR 36298; July 6, 1993).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Class E airspace designations listed in this document will be published subsequently in this Order.

The Rule
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The amendment to part 71 of the Federal Aviation Regulation establishes and amends Class E airspace at Ukiah, CA. This
action modifies controlled airspace from 700 to 1200 feet AGL and establishes controlled airspace from the surface
for IFR operations at the Ukiah Municipal Airport at Ukiah, CA.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FAA has determined that this regulation only involves an established body of technical regulations for which
frequent and routine amendments are necessary to keep them operationally current. It, therefore, (1) is not a ``significant
regulatory action'' under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under DOT Regulatory Policies
and Procedures (44 FR 11034; February 26, 1979); and (3) does not warrant preparation of a regulatory evaluation as
the anticipated impact is so minimal. Since this is a routine matter that will only affect air traffic procedures and
air navigation, it is certified that this rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number
of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
On March 21, 1994, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) published a final rule that revoked the Class D airspace
at Fritzsche Army Air Field (AAF), Ft. Ord, California, and revised the Salinas Class D airspace (59 FR 13194). In describing
the Salinas Class D airspace, the notation to indicate the Salinas Class D airspace as being part-time was inadvertently
omitted. This correction to the final rule corrects that omission.

SUMMARY: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
This amendment establishes, amends, suspends, or revokes Standard Instrument Approach Procedures (SIAPs) for
operations at certain airports. These regulatory actions are needed because of changes occurring in the National
Airspace System, such as the commissioning of new navigational facilities, addition of new obstacles, or changes
in air traffic requirements. These changes are designed to provide safe and efficient use of the navigable airspace
and to promote safe flight operations under instrument flight rules at the affected airports.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
This amendment to part 97 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR part 97) establishes, amends, suspends, or revokes
Standard Instrument Approach Procedures (SIAPs). The complete regulatory description on each SIAP is contained
in the appropriate FAA Form 8260 and the National Flight Data Center (FDC)/Permanent (P) Notices to Airmen (NOTAM)
which are incorporated by reference in the amendment under 5 U.S.C. 552(a), 1 CFR part 51, and &sect;97.20 of the Federal
Aviations Regulations (FAR). Materials incorporated by reference are available for examination or purchase as
stated above.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The large number of SIAPs, their complex nature, and the need for a special format make their verbatim publication
in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 expensive and impractical. Further, airmen do not use the regulatory text of the SIAPs, but refer to their graphic
depiction of charts printed by publishers of aeronautical materials. Thus, the advantages of incorporation by reference
are realized and publication of the complete description of each SIAP contained in FAA form documents is unnecessary.
The provisions of this amendment state the affected CFR (and FAR) sections, with the types and effective dates of the
SIAPs. This amendment also identifies the airport, its location, the procedure identification and the amendment
number.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
The Rule
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This amendment to part 97 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR part 97) establishes, amends, suspends, or revokes
SIAPs. For safety and timeliness of change considerations, this amendment incorporates only specific changes contained
in the content of the following FDC/P NOTAM for each SIAP. The SIAP information in some previously designated FDC/Temporary
(FDC/T) NOTAMs is of such duration as to be permanent. With conversion to FDC/P NOTAMs, the respective FDC/T NOTAMs
have been cancelled.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FDC/P NOTAMs for the SIAPs contained in this amendment are based on the criteria contained in the U.S. Standard
for Terminal Instrument Approach Procedures (TERPS). In developing these chart changes to SIAPs by FDC/P NOTAMS,
the TERPS criteria were applied to only these specific conditions existing at the affected airports.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This amendment to part 97 contains separate SIAPs which have compliance dates stated as effective dates based on related
changes in the National Airspace System or the application of new or revised criteria. All SIAP amendments in this
rule have been previously issued by the FAA in a National Flight Data Center (FDC) Notice to Airmen (NOTAM) as an emergency
action of immediate flight safety relating directly to published aeronautical charts. The circumstances which
created the need for all these SIAP amendments requires making them effective in less than 30 days.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Further, the SIAPs contained in this amendment are based on the criteria contained in the TERPS. Because of the close
and immediate relationship between these SIAPs and safety in air commerce, I find that notice and public procedure
before adopting these SIAPs are unnecessary, impracticable, and contrary to the public interest and, where applicable,
that good cause exists for making these SIAPs effective in less than 30 days.

Conclusion
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The FAA has determined that this regulation only involves an established body of technical regulations for which
frequent and routine amendments are necessary to keep them operationally current. It, therefore_(1) Is not a ``significant
regulatory action'' under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under DOT Regulatory Policies
and Procedures (44 FR 11034; February 26, 1979); and (3) does not warrant preparation of a regulatory evaluation as
the anticipated impact is so minimal. For the same reason, the FAA certifies that this amendment will not have a significant
economic impact on a substantial number of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act.

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is amending the standard of quality regulation for bottled water to establish
an allowable level of 0.005 milligrams per liter (mg/L) for lead in bottled water. FDA also is retaining the existing
allowable level of 1.0 mg/L for copper in bottled water. This final rule will ensure both that the minimum quality of
bottled water with respect to copper and lead remains comparable to the quality of public drinking water, and that
bottled water will be free of any significant lead contamination. This final rule is consistent with FDA's goal of
reducing consumers' exposure to lead in drinking water to the extent practicable.

I. Background
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Under section 410 of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the act) (21 U.S.C. 349), whenever the Environmental
Protection Agency (EPA) prescribes interim or revised National Primary Drinking Water Regulations (NPDWR's) under
section 1412 of the Public Health Service Act (The Safe Drinking Water Act (SDWA) (42 U.S.C. 300f through 300j-9)),
FDA is required to consult with EPA and either amend its regulations for bottled drinking water (&sect;103.35(21
CFR 103.35)) or publish in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 its reasons for not making such amendments.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 of June 7, 1991 (56 FR 26460), EPA published a final rule promulgating NPDWR's that established corrosion control
treatment technique requirements for controlling lead and copper levels in public water systems when these contaminants
exceed levels of 0.015 mg/L for lead and 1.3 mg/L for copper in more than 10 percent of targeted tap samples. Targeted
tap water samples represent samples collected from residences most likely to have lead problems as a result of corrosion
in the distribution systems. EPA established treatment technique requirements rather than maximum contaminant
levels (MCL's) for lead and copper in drinking water because it believed that treatment technique requirements are
more appropriate to control contamination of lead and copper that is largely the result of circumstances beyond the
direct control of public water systems (i.e., corrosion in service lines not owned by the systems and in the plumbing
of residences and buildings). In addition, EPA established maximum contaminant level goals (MCLG's) of zero for
lead and 1.3 mg/L for copper which are based solely on considerations of protecting the public from the adverse health
effects of these contaminants in drinking water.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In accordance with section 410 of the act, FDA published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 of January 5, 1993 (58 FR 389), a proposal to amend the quality standard for bottled water to establish an allowable
level of 0.005 mg/L for lead and to retain the existing allowable level of 1.0 mg/L for copper. FDA proposed a lower level
of 0.005 mg/L for lead in bottled water than EPA's level of 0.015 mg/L for lead in drinking water that triggers treatment
technique requirements. FDA's data showed that most bottlers do not normally experience the significant lead contamination
problems from corrosion of materials that are presented by public water distribution systems and residential plumbing
(e.g., pipes, faucets, and solder), and that bottlers can produce bottled water products with lead levels below 0.005
mg/L. Furthermore, this level represents the lowest level at which FDA can take enforcement action because it corresponds
to the practical quantitation limit (PQL) of the best available analytical methods for determining lead levels in
water. Finally, FDA noted that establishing the allowable level for lead at 0.005 mg/L would provide public health
protection at least equivalent to that provided by EPA's NPDWR and would ensure that bottled water products are free
of significant lead contamination.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
With respect to the allowable level for copper, the existing allowable level of 1.0 mg/L in bottled water is below EPA's
MCLG of 1.3 mg/L and is equivalent to EPA's secondary maximum contaminant level (SMCL), which is based on the aesthetic
effects of copper in drinking water. Thus, FDA proposed to retain the existing allowable level to ensure that levels
of copper in bottled water meet the safety and aesthetic criteria that EPA has established for copper in drinking water.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On November 8, 1990, the enactment of the Nutrition Labeling and Education Act of 1990 (Pub. L. 101&hyph;535) removed
standard of quality rulemakings from the coverage of the formal rulemaking procedures in section 701(e) of the act
(21 U.S.C. 371(e)). FDA, therefore, proposed the amendments to the bottled water quality standard regulations for
lead and copper using notice and comment rulemaking under section 701(a) of the act. Interested persons were given
until March 8, 1993, to comment on the proposed regulation.

FDA received approximately 130 responses to the January 5, 1993, proposal. Each of these responses contained one
or more comments from industry, consumers, trade associations, Federal government officials, State government
agencies, consumer advocacy organizations, and a private research foundation. The comments generally supported
the proposal. Many comments addressed issues that are outside the scope of the proposal (e.g., allowable levels for
total trihalomethanes, chlorine, and fluoride in the quality standard for bottled water). These comments will not
be discussed here. A number of comments suggested modifications to, or were opposed to, various provisions of the
proposal. A summary of the suggested changes, the opposing comments, and the agency's responses follows.

1. Most comments supported the proposed allowable levels of 0.005 mg/L for lead and 1.0 mg/L for copper in the quality
standard for bottled water. One comment, however, stated that the allowable level for lead in bottled water should
not be any lower than EPA's corrosion treatment trigger level of 0.015 mg/L for lead in drinking water because this
level corresponds to an average lead level of 0.005 mg/L, the level which most bottled waters do not exceed. The comment
argued that the fact that 0.005 mg/L is at the lower limit of reliable measurement for lead does not justify setting
a standard at that level. The comment further argued that setting a standard for lead in bottled water is not necessary
because lead content is not a problem in bottled water. The comment maintained that imposing regulations for the sake
of regulation is a problem because of the high costs incurred by diverting FDA resources from significant regulatory
concerns.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FDA disagrees with this comment. Under section 410 of the act, FDA's approach has been to respond to EPA's promulgation
of drinking water regulations under the SDWA by amending the quality standard for bottled water to maintain compatibility
with EPA's regulations. FDA concludes that amending the standard for lead in bottled water to 0.005 mg/L is fully compatible
and consistent with the EPA standard. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Based on the available health effects information, EPA established an MCLG of zero for lead in drinking water. By adopting
this MCLG, EPA was in effect saying that if zero lead in drinking water can be achieved, it should be achieved. However,
EPA concluded that zero lead in public drinking water could not be achieved because of contamination of the water with
lead from corrosion of lead-containing materials in public water distribution systems and in residential plumbing.
To control this contamination, EPA established treatment technique requirements which are triggered when more
than 10 percent of the targeted tap water samples exceeds 0.015 mg/L for lead. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Bottled water, however, generally does not have significant lead contamination problems. FDA conducted a survey
of bottled water in 1990 (Ref. 1), and the findings of that survey show that most bottlers are using source waters that
are free of significant lead contamination and can readily produce bottled water products with lead levels below
0.005 mg/L, the PQL for lead in water. Consequently, because this level, which is as close to EPA's MCLG of zero as possible,
is achievable in bottled water, there is no reason for FDA to rely on EPA's 0.015 mg/L trigger level in establishing
an allowable level for lead in bottled water. In fact, in its review and comment on FDA's proposal (before it published
in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
), EPA stated that the regulatory approach taken by FDA to establish an allowable level of 0.005 mg/L for lead in bottled
water is consistent with the intent of the NPDWR for lead in public drinking water (Ref. 4).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. One comment asserted that there is no safe threshold for lead in drinking water and, because technological resources
and knowledge make it feasible to measure lead in water at the 0.002 mg/L level, FDA should establish the allowable
level for lead in bottled water at that level. The comment contended that, because large water companies have been
testing for lead and reporting lead levels of 0, 0.001, 0.002, 0.003, and 0.004 mg/L to EPA, the PQL is substantially
lower than 0.005 mg/L. The comment stated that another organization, which has limited resources and is not in the
business of supplying water commercially, uses a laboratory that has found the PQL to be 0.002 mg/L when testing for
lead in bottled water. The comment further argued that EPA's PQL concept is theoretically inappropriate for safety
determinations because the error theory of laboratory measurements (i.e., the distinction between the standard
error of a single measurement and the standard error among a group of measurements) upon which EPA bases its determination
of the PQL is misleading. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FDA disagrees that EPA's PQL concept is inappropriate. EPA's PQL is set at the lowest concentration for a contaminant
that laboratories certified by the States or by EPA for water analyses can reliably measure within specified limits
of precision and accuracy under routine laboratory operating conditions. EPA also determines the PQL based on the
method detection limit (MDL), which is defined as the lowest concentration of a substance that can be measured with
99 percent confidence that the true value is greater than zero. EPA generally sets the PQL at 5 to 10 times the MDL, depending
on the degree of health risk posed by a contaminant (for contaminants like lead that pose a high degree of health risk,
EPA sets the PQL at 5 times the MDL), and, if possible, confirms the PQL by interlaboratory performance evaluation
studies. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Based on EPA's calculation of a 0.001 mg/L MDL for lead by the most sensitive analytical methods available, EPA set
the PQL for lead at 0.005 mg/L. EPA confirmed this level by performance evaluation studies that evaluated the ability
of EPA, State, and non-EPA and State laboratories to analyze water samples with low lead levels (56 FR 26460 at 26511,
June 7, 1991). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Although the comment stated that a laboratory used by another organization found the PQL to be 0.002 mg/L for lead in
bottled water, it did not provide any data to support that laboratory's determination. Therefore, this comment has
not provided an adequate basis upon which to call into question EPA's PQL. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In summary, based on the studies conducted by EPA establishing a PQL of 0.005 mg/L for lead in drinking water, FDA finds
that an allowable level of 0.005 mg/L for lead in the quality standard for bottled water is appropriate. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. Another comment stated that, although it strongly endorsed the proposed allowable level for lead in bottled water,
FDA should review this standard in a few years because EPA's 1991 rule for lead in drinking water has led to increased
analysis for lead in water, and, using the best available methodology, many laboratories can now routinely measure
lead levels at 0.001 or 0.002 mg/L in water samples. The comment maintained that measurement of lead in water at these
levels may soon be the standard, ``state of the art'' technology, and that it would be appropriate to set the allowable
level in bottled water at the limit of detection, i.e., 0.005 mg/L, or no detectable lead, whichever is less. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FDA disagrees that establishing the allowable level for lead in bottled water at the limit of detection, i.e., 0.005
mg/L, or no detectable lead, whichever is less, is appropriate. As discussed above, 0.005 mg/L, the PQL for lead in
water, represents the lowest concentration that State- or EPA-certified laboratories for water analyses can reliably
measure within specified limits of precision and accuracy under routine laboratory operating conditions. FDA recognizes
that lead levels in water can be measured below 0.005 mg/L. However, to take an enforcement action based on level of
a contaminant in a food, FDA must be able to reliably establish the level of the contaminant in the food. EPA's PQL of
0.005 mg/L has been confirmed by performance evaluation studies as the lowest level of lead in water samples that can
be reliably and consistently measured (56 FR 26460 at 26511). Thus, FDA has concluded that reliance on the PQL as the
allowable level for lead in bottled water is appropriate. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Nevertheless, FDA agrees that technology for analytical methodology is constantly advancing. Reliable measurement
of lead levels below 0.005 mg/L in water samples, within specified limits of precision and accuracy under routine
laboratory operating conditions, may soon become the general norm. Therefore, FDA agrees with the comment that within
the next few years, it should consult with EPA about reevaluating the PQL for lead in water. Moreover, FDA recognizes
that, should EPA revise the PQL, FDA will need to consider whether an allowable level for lead in bottled water below
0.005 mg/L is appropriate. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 4. A State government agency and a majority of the comments from industry and trade associations opposed the statement
in the proposal that if the proposal becomes a final rule, bottlers will be required to test each lot of bottled water
to ensure that it contains less than 0.005 mg/L of lead. The comments argued that, because most bottlers are routinely
meeting the 0.005 mg/L standard for lead, a requirement for testing each lot of bottled water for lead is not necessary.
Furthermore, the majority of the comments argued that testing each lot of bottled water for lead would impose a significant
financial burden on the bottled water industry. For example, comments from two trade associations representing
bottled water manufacturers maintained that a requirement for testing each lot of bottled water for lead would impose
additional annual costs that they estimated at $15,000 for a small bottler and $300,000 for a large bottler.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under the current good manufacturing practice (CGMP) regulations for the processing and bottling of bottled drinking
water (part 129 (21 CFR part 129)), bottlers are required to analyze, at least annually, for chemical contaminants,
including lead, in a representative sample from a batch or a segment of a continuous production run for each type of
bottled drinking water produced during a day's production (&sect;129.80(g)(2)). Therefore, bottlers will not
be required to test each lot of bottled water for the presence of lead. The statement that they would, which was inadvertently
included in the economic impact analysis, was in error. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
However, FDA reminds water bottlers that each lot of bottled water must comply with the quality standard for chemical
contaminants, and compliance with the minimum annual testing requirements of the CGMP does not exempt a firm from
regulatory action if any lot of bottled water does not meet any provision of the chemical quality standard.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
5. Several comments recommended that testing for chemical contaminants (e.g., lead and copper) should be more frequent
than the required minimum of annual testing. One comment noted that, although FDA has established quality standards
for bottled water, it did not set any requirements for monitoring timeframes or submission of results to ensure that
bottlers meet the quality standards. Moreover, the comment objected to allowing distribution of a bottled water
product that is below the water quality standard, arguing that, given the emphasis on the quality of bottled water
verses tap water by the bottled water industry, bottlers are not likely to print a ``substandard'' statement on the
label. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FDA agrees that bottlers are not likely to market bottled water that would be required to bear a statement of substandard
quality with respect to lead. However, FDA notes that the use of such a statement on the label of a food covered by a standard
of quality is specifically provided for by section 403(h)(1) of the act (21 U.S.C. 343(h)(1)), if that food falls below
the prescribed quality standard. Therefore, FDA cannot preclude the use of the statement of substandard quality.
Nonetheless, &sect;103.35(g) provides that any bottled water containing a substance at a level considered injurious
to health under section 402 of the act (21 U.S.C. 342) is deemed to be adulterated and may be subject to regulatory action,
even if the bottled water bears a label statement of substandard quality.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FDA notes that the CGMP regulations for processing and bottling of bottled drinking water (part 129) require that
the water to be bottled be obtained from an approved source properly located, protected, and operated; be of a safe,
sanitary quality; and be in compliance at all times with the applicable laws and regulations of the government agency
or agencies having jurisdiction (&sect;129.35). In addition, &sect;129.35(a) requires that samples of source
water be analyzed as often as necessary, but at least once each year, for chemical contaminants, and &sect;129.80(g)
requires that each type of bottled water product be analyzed at least annually for chemical contaminants. Moreover,
&sect;129.80(h) requires that records of the results for these tests be maintained at the plant for at least 2 years
and be available for official review at reasonable times. FDA is not aware of any data or other information that suggests
that requiring all bottlers to test for lead more frequently is necessary to ensure that bottled water is safe and of
acceptable quality. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FDA emphasizes that water bottlers are responsible for ensuring, through appropriate manufacturing techniques
and sufficient quality control procedures, that all bottled water products introduced or delivered for introduction
into interstate commerce are safe, wholesome, and truthfully labeled, and that they comply with the provisions of
the quality standard. Therefore, should any bottler encounter circumstances that would warrant testing for lead
more frequently than once per year, the bottler is required to do such testing to ensure the safety and quality of the
bottled water. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For the reasons stated above, FDA concludes that the testing requirements for contaminants in bottled water contained
in the CGMP regulations (part 129) are appropriate and sufficient to ensure the quality and safety of bottled water
products. Thus, the agency finds that revision of the CGMP regulations to require more frequent testing for chemical
contaminants in bottled water is not necessary at this time.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
6. A majority of responses from industry opposed the exemption of mineral water from the lead standard for bottled
water. Another comment stated that the lead standard should apply to other types of bottled beverages, including
mineral water, soda water, and seltzer. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under the provisions of &sect;103.35, the definition of ``bottled water'' excludes mineral water or any type of soft
drink commonly known as soda water. Consequently, these types of products are exempt from the provisions of the quality
standard for bottled water, including the allowable level for lead. However, in a proposal to establish a standard
of identity for bottled water (57 FR 393, January 5, 1993), FDA proposed to revise the definition for ``bottled water''
in the quality standard to include mineral water. Should FDA adopt that proposal, the allowable level of 0.005 mg/L
for lead will apply to mineral water. Even if the agency does not adopt this change, because of the health concerns raised
by lead, the agency is likely to take some action to regulate the level of lead in mineral water. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In regard to soda water and seltzer, FDA considers these types of products to be soft drinks and not bottled water. Consequently,
they are not covered by regulations that address bottled water. The agency's reasons for considering these types
of products as soft drinks are fully discussed in its proposal to establish an identity standard for bottled water
(57 FR 393 at 395). Soft drinks are subject to regulatory action, however, if they contain a level of lead that may render
the food injurious to health. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
7. One comment from a trade association representing public water supply agencies recommended that FDA review the
latest EPA analytical techniques for determining lead and copper with respect to the use of nitric acid digestion
and incorporate this procedure as applicable. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In accordance with FDA's responsibilities pursuant to section 410 of the act, FDA consulted with EPA by requesting
EPA's review and comment on the proposal to amend the quality standard for lead and copper in bottled water. In response,
EPA stated that FDA's regulatory approach for lead and copper in bottled water is consistent with the intent of EPA's
NPDWR's for lead and copper and concurred with the analytical methods that FDA cited for determining lead and copper
in bottled water (Ref. 4). Furthermore, in EPA Methods 200.7, 200.8, and 200.9, which FDA proposed to incorporate
by reference, the sample preparation procedures for measuring lead and copper as total recoverable metals call for
a nitric acid or nitric acid-hydrochloric acid digestion.

III. Conclusions
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The agency is adopting the provisions concerning lead and copper in the quality standard for bottled water as proposed
(58 FR 389, January 5, 1993). The majority of the comments that the agency received supported the proposal. Furthermore,
after carefully considering the comments that the agency received that suggested modifications to, or were opposed
to, aspects of the proposal, the agency has determined that no changes are warranted. Therefore, upon the effective
date of this rule, November 21, 1994, any bottled water that contains an amount of lead or copper that exceeds the allowable
levels will be misbranded under section 403(h)(1) of the act unless the bottled water bears a statement of substandard
quality as provided by &sect;103.35(f)(2)(ii). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FDA has made one minor change concerning the analytical methods for the determination of lead and copper cited in new
&sect;103.35(d)(3)(v). The sources for these methods will be the National Technical Information Services rather
than EPA. This change is consistent with the agency's practice of relying on readily available commercial sources
for incorporated materials when possible.

IV. Environmental Impact 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The agency previously considered the environmental effects of this rule, as announced in the proposed rule (58 FR
389, January 5, 1993). At that time, the agency concluded that the action would not have a significant impact on the
human environment, and that an environmental impact statement is not required. The agency's environmental assessment
and finding of no significant impact for the proposal were displayed at the Dockets Management Branch at the time of
the proposal. FDA has received no new information or comments that would affect the agency's previous determination
that there is no significant impact on the human environment, and that an environmental impact statement is not required.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
V. Analysis of Impacts 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
FDA has examined the impacts of the final rule under Executive Order 12866 and the Regulatory Flexibility Act (Pub.
L. 96&hyph;354). Executive Order 12866 directs agencies to assess all costs and benefits of available regulatory
alternatives and, when regulation is necessary, to select regulatory approaches that maximize net benefits (including
potential economic, environmental, public health and safety, and other advantages; distributive impacts; and
equity). The agency believes that this final rule is consistent with the regulatory philosophy and principles identified
in the Executive Order. In addition, the final rule is not a significant regulatory action as defined by the Executive
Order and so is not subject to review under the Executive Order.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Regulatory Flexibility Act requires agencies to analyze regulatory options that would minimize any significant
impact of a rule on small entities. Because FDA has received no new information or comments that would alter its tentative
finding in the proposal that there is no substantive economic issue, the agency certifies that the final rule will
not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. Therefore, under the Regulatory
Flexibility Act, no further analysis is required.

SUMMARY: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is amending the U.S. standard of identity for margarine to permit the use of
any form of oil of marine species that has been affirmed as generally recognized as safe (GRAS) or approved as a food
additive for this use. This action is in response to a petition submitted by the National Fish Meal and Oil Association
(NFMOA). FDA believes that this action will provide increased flexibility to manufacturers in the selection of lipid
ingredients in margarine and will promote honesty and fair dealing in the interest of consumers.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=2 -->
I. The Proposal
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
In the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 of August 30, 1990 (55 FR 35439), FDA published a proposal based on a petition from NFMOA, 1525 Wilson Blvd., suite 500,
Arlington, VA 22209, to amend the U.S. standard of identity for margarine (&sect;166.110 (21 CFR 166.110)) to permit
the use of any form of marine oil that has been affirmed as GRAS or approved as a food additive for this use as an additional
optional edible fat or oil ingredient in margarine. Interested persons were given until October 29, 1990, to submit
comments.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
II. The Tentative Final Rule
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The NFMOA petition was filed under section 701(e) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the act) (21 U.S.C. 371(e)),
which requires formal rulemaking in any action for the amendment of a food standard. However, in November 1990, the
Nutrition Labeling and Education Act of 1990 (Pub. L. 101&hyph;535) was signed into law, and it removed food standard
rulemaking proceedings, except for actions for the amendment or repeal of food standards of identity for dairy products
or maple sirup, from the formal rulemaking proceedings of section 701(e) of the act. Therefore, further action on
the NFMOA petition would be subject to the informal notice and comment rulemaking proceedings of section 701(a) of
the act. Thus, the agency published a tentative final rule in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 of August 17, 1993 (58 FR 43580), under those procedures. Because there had been an opportunity to comment on the proposal
when it was published in 1990, the comment period on that tentative final rule was 30 days.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
III. Comments
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
FDA received one comment in response to the tentative final rule. This comment, submitted by the petitioner, expressed
support for the rule and urged the agency to finalize the rule as soon as possible. NFMOA also stated that it would like
to make clear for the record that its petition did not ask FDA to approve the use of any form of marine oil but was instead
restricted to ``any safe and suitable form of menhaden oil.'' The comment stated that, nevertheless, it had no objection
to FDA's enlargement of the range of oils to be permitted by the amended regulation, from menhaden oil to marine oil,
provided that this change does not result in any further delay in the rulemaking proceeding.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The agency acknowledges that the petitioner only sought to provide for safe and suitable forms of menhaden oil in margarine.
However, FDA believes that it is appropriate to provide for oil of any marine species where such oil has been affirmed
as GRAS or approved as a food additive for this use. The broader provision in the standard of identity will eliminate
the need to amend the standard of identity for margarine should other oils of marine species be found to be safe and suitable
for use in this food. FDA also notes that ingredient labeling will inform consumers of the presence of such oils when
used in margarine.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Therefore, having received no adverse comments, the agency is revising the margarine standard as proposed in the
tentative final rule. The agency believes that providing for optional oils of marine species that have been affirmed
as GRAS or listed as a food additive for this use will increase manufacturers' options in the selection of oil ingredients
for margarine and will provide for a wider variety of margarine products in the marketplace. Thus, the agency concludes
that the proposed change in the standard of identity for margarine will promote honesty and fair dealing in the interest
of consumers.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Accordingly, after consideration of the comments, the agency is issuing this final rule to amend the standard of identity
for margarine in &sect;166.110 as set forth below.

IV. Economic Impact
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
FDA has examined the economic implications of this final rule to amend the standard of identity for margarine in 21
CFR part 166 as required by Executive Order (E.O.) 12866 and the Regulatory Flexibility Act (Pub. L. 96&hyph;354).
E.O. 12866 directs agencies to assess all costs and benefits of available regulatory alternatives and, when regulation
is necessary, to select regulatory approaches that maximize net benefits (including potential economic, environmental,
public health, and safety effects, distributive impacts, and equity). The Regulatory Flexibility Act requires
that the agency analyze options for regulatory relief for small businesses.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In the August 17, 1993, tentative final rule, FDA announced that it had analyzed the economic impact of the new provision
that FDA is adopting under the previous E.O. 12291 and found that it would not have a significant impact. E.O. 12291
compelled agencies to use cost-benefit analysis as a component of decisionmaking. The agency also tentatively concluded
in the August 30, 1990, proposal that this action would not result in a significant economic impact on a substantial
number of small entities. Manufacturers may continue to produce margarine using current formulations. Thus, no
changes are required in formulations unless manufacturers wish to reformulate their products. FDA has received
no new information or comments that would alter its tentative finding that there is no substantive economic issue
in this rulemaking. Thus, FDA concludes that this is not a major rule as defined by E.O. 12291, nor is it a significant
rule as defined by E.O. 12866. In compliance with the Regulatory Flexibility Act, the agency certifies that the final
rule will not have a significant impact on a substantial number of small businesses.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
V. Environmental Impact
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In the preamble to the August 30, 1990, proposed rule, FDA reported its finding that this action qualified for categorical
exclusion under 21 CFR 25.24(b)(1) and that neither an environmental assessment (EA) nor an environmental impact
statement was required. As noted in the tentative final rule, FDA received one comment on the proposed rule that claimed
that this action would result in increased fishing pressure that could adversely affect the menhaden fishery, and
that the agency had not considered this potential impact prior to issuing the proposed rule. Although the comment
did not provide evidence to support the contention that the menhaden fishery would be adversely affected, FDA requested
an EA from the petitioner. The decision to ask for an EA takes into consideration the agency's assessment of this issue
as part of its previous action to affirm partially hydrogenated menhaden oil and hydrogenated menhaden oil as GRAS
for use as edible fats or oils (54 FR 38219, September 15, 1989). The agency also has information indicating that the
market for menhaden oil as a component of margarine is large, approximately 40 million pounds per year.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Based on information in the petitioner's EA submitted for the current action and on the agency's analysis of the reports
on the menhaden fisheries issued subsequent to FDA approval of GRAS petition (GRASP 6G0316 (54 FR 38219)), FDA concluded
in the August 17, 1993, tentative final rule that the proposed action would not have a significant impact on the menhaden
fishery. Amending the margarine standard of identity will not increase the volume of crude menhaden oil that is produced.
The only change will be that crude menhaden oil will more often be retained in the United States for further processing
into food grade products, instead of being shipped to Europe and elsewhere for this same use.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Thus, FDA carefully considered the potential environmental effects of this action, including the effects on the
menhaden fishery and concluded that the action will not have a significant impact on the human environment, and that
an environmental impact statement is not required. The agency's finding of no significant impact, and the evidence
supporting that finding, which includes the petitioner's EA, the finding of no significant impact for FDA's approval
of GRASP 6G0316 (54 FR 38219), and a copy of ``National Marine Fisheries Service Final Purse-seine Landings of Gulf
and Atlantic Menhaden in the 1990 and 1991 Fishing Seasons'' have been placed on file in the Dockets Management Branch
(HFA&hyph;305), Food and Drug Administration, rm. 1&hyph;23, 12420 Parklawn Dr., Rockville, MD 20857, and may be
seen by interested persons between 9 a.m. and 4 p.m., Monday through Friday.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The agency has not received any additional information that would cause it to revise its finding of no significant
impact on the human environment. Therefore, neither an environmental assessment nor an environmental impact statement
is required.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
FDA has evaluated data submitted in accordance with regulations promulgated under section 507 of the Federal Food,
Drug, and Cosmetic Act (21 U.S.C. 357), as amended, with respect to a request for approval of (1) a new bulk form of cefotetan,
cefotetan, and (2) for its use in a new dosage form of cefotetan sodium, cefotetan sodium injection. The agency has
concluded that the data supplied by the manufacturer concerning this antibiotic drug are adequate to establish its
safety and efficacy when used as directed in the labeling and that the regulations should be amended in 21 CFR part 442
to provide for the inclusion of accepted standards for this product.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
Environmental Impact
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The agency has determined under 21 CFR 25.24(c)(6) that this action is of a type that does not individually or cumulatively
have a significant effect on the human environment. Therefore, neither an environmental assessment nor an environmental
impact statement is required.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This final rule announces standards that FDA has accepted in a request for approval of an antibiotic drug. Because
this final rule is not controversial and because, when effective, it provides notice of accepted standards, FDA finds
that notice and comment procedure is unnecessary and not in the public interest. This final rule, therefore, is effective
June 24, 1994. However, interested persons may, on or before June 24, 1994, submit written comments to the Dockets
Management Branch (address above). Two copies of any comments are to be submitted, except that individuals may submit
one copy. Comments are to be identified with the docket number found in brackets in the heading of this document. Received
comments may be seen in the Dockets Management Branch between 9 a.m. and 4 p.m., Monday through Friday.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Any person who will be adversely affected by this final rule may file objections to it and request a hearing. Reasonable
grounds for the hearing must be shown. Any person who decides to seek a hearing must file (1) on or before June 24, 1994,
a written notice of participation and request for a hearing, and (2) on or before July 25, 1994, the data, information,
and analyses on which the person relies to justify a hearing, as specified in 21 CFR 314.300. A request for a hearing
may not rest upon mere allegations or denials, but must set forth specific facts showing that there is a genuine and
substantial issue of fact that requires a hearing. If it conclusively appears from the face of the data, information,
and factual analyses in the request for a hearing that no genuine and substantial issue of fact precludes the action
taken by this order, or if a request for a hearing is not made in the required format or with the required analyses, the
Commissioner of Food and Drugs will enter summary judgment against the person(s) who request(s) the hearing, making
findings and conclusions and denying a hearing. All submissions must be filed in three copies, identified with the
docket number appearing in the heading of this document and filed with the Dockets Management Branch.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The procedures and requirements governing this order, a notice of participation and request for a hearing, a submission
of data, information, and analyses to justify a hearing, other comments, and grant or denial of a hearing are contained
in 21 CFR 314.300.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
All submissions under this order, except for data and information prohibited from public disclosure under 21 U.S.C.
331(j) or 18 U.S.C. 1905, may be seen in the Dockets Management Branch (address above) between 9 a.m. and 4 p.m., Monday
through Friday.

Working standard solution
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. Accurately weigh approximately 50 milligrams of the cefotetan working standard into a 250-milliliter volumetric
flask containing 12.5 milliliters of methanol. Swirl the flask for several minutes, then add 12.5 milliliters of
acetonitrile. Swirl the flask until the cefotetan is dissolved. Dilute to volume with water to obtain a solution containing
approximately 200 micrograms of cefotetan per milliliter. Mix well. Protect the working standard solution from
light.

Sample solution
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. Dissolve an accurately weighed portion of the sample with sufficient diluting solution described in paragraph
(b)(1)(i)(A) of this section to obtain a concentration of approximately 200 micrograms of cefotetan per milliliter.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Resolution test solution
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. Place 10 milliliters of the working standard solution in a stoppered flask containing a few milligrams of magnesium
carbonate. Close the flask and sonicate for 10 minutes. If the solution is not slightly turbid, add more magnesium
carbonate and repeat sonication. Filter the turbid solution through a 0.5-micron filter and use within 2 hours. As
this solution stands, the tautomer concentration increases.

. Cefotetan sodium injection is a frozen, aqueous, iso-osmotic solution of cefotetan and sodium bicarbonate. It
contains one or more suitable and harmless buffer substances and a tonicity adjusting agent. Each milliliter contains
cefotetan disodium equivalent to 20 milligrams or 40 milligrams of cefotetan per milliliter. Its cefotetan content
is satisfactory if it is not less than 90 percent and not more than 120 percent of the number of milligrams of cefotetan
that it is represented to contain. It is sterile. It contains not more than 0.17 endotoxin units per milligram of cefotetan.
Its pH is not less than 4.0 and not more than 6.5. It passes the identity test. The cefotetan used conforms to the standards
prescribed by &sect;442.52(a)(1).

 (cythioate) tablet in addition to the approved 30-mg tablet for control of fleas on dogs. The supplemental NADA is
approved as of April 25, 1994, and the regulations are amended in 21 CFR 520.531 to reflect the approval.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Approval of this supplement does not require submission of new safety or effectiveness data. This supplement provides
for use of a larger tablet with increased drug concentration to be given at the currently approved use level. However,
in accordance with the freedom of information provisions of part 20 (21 CFR part 20) and &sect;514.11(e)(2)(ii) (21
CFR 514.11(e)(2)(ii)), a freedom of information summary is provided for the revised labeling.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under section 512(c)(2)(F)(iii) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (21 U.S.C. 360b(c)(2)(F)(iii)), this
approval does not qualify for marketing exclusivity. The additional studies submitted with the supplement were
conducted as requested by FDA to correct deficiencies in the original data supporting safety and effectiveness of
the 1968 approval, and they were not essential to the approval of this supplement.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The agency has determined under 21 CFR 25.24(d)(1)(iii) that this action is of a type that does not individually or
cumulatively have a significant effect on the human environment. Therefore, neither an environmental assessment
nor an environmental impact statement is required.

SUMMARY: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is amending the animal drug regulations to reflect approval of a supplemental
new animal drug application (NADA) filed by Hoechst-Roussel Agri-Vet Co. The supplemental NADA provides for oral
administration of fenbendazole suspension to goats as an anthelmintic. The regulations are also amended to establish
a tolerance for drug residues in edible goat tissues.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
Hoechst-Roussel Agri-Vet Co., Rt. 202&hyph;206 North, Somerville, NJ 08876, filed a supplemental NADA 128&hyph;620
that provides for oral administration of a suspension containing 10 percent fenbendazole to nonlactating goats
for removal and control of stomach and intestinal worms 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=3 -->
Haemonchus contortus

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=3 -->
Ostertagia circumcincta
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
. Also, a tolerance for residues of fenbendazole and its metabolites in edible goat tissues is established. Approval
is based in part on data and information in Public Master File (PMF) 5118 established under the Interregional Research
Project No. 4 (IR&hyph;4), Northcentral Region, Michigan State University, East Lansing, MI 48824.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The supplement is approved as of April 25, 1994, and the regulations are amended in 21 CFR 520.905a and 556.275 to reflect
the approval. The basis for approval is discussed in the freedom of information summary. Additionally, the regulations
for tolerances and safe concentrations for residues of the drug or its metabolites in cattle and swine are editorially
revised to remove any reference to safe concentrations because they are irrelevant for residue monitoring purposes.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In accordance with the freedom of information provisions of part 20 (21 CFR part 20) and &sect;514.11(e)(2)(ii) (21
CFR 514.11(e)(2)(ii)), a summary of safety and effectiveness data and information submitted to support approval
of this application may be seen in the Dockets Management Branch (HFA&hyph;305), Food and Drug Administration, rm.
1&hyph;23, 12420 Parklawn Dr., Rockville, MD 20857, between 9 a.m. and 4 p.m., Monday through Friday.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under section 512(c)(2)(F)(iii) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (21 U.S.C. 360b(c)(2)(F)(iii), this
approval does not qualify for marketing exclusivity because no new clinical or field investigations (other than
bioequivalence or residue studies) and no new human food safety studies (other than bioequivalence or residue studies)
essential to approval of the supplement were conducted or sponsored by the applicant.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The agency has carefully considered the potential environmental effects of this action. FDA has concluded that the
action will not have a significant impact on the human environment, and that an environmental impact statement is
not required. The agency's finding of no significant impact and the evidence supporting that finding, contained
in an environmental assessment, may be seen in the Dockets Management Branch (address above) between 9 a.m. and 4 p.m.,
Monday through Friday.

ANADA 200&hyph;143 is as a generic copy of Agri-Bio's NADA 139&hyph;190. ANADA 200&hyph;143 is approved as of May
25, 1994. The regulations are amended in &sect;558.550

 (21 CFR 558.550) to reflect the approval. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This approval is for use of single ingredient Type A medicated articles to make Type C medicated feeds. Roxarsone is
a Category II drug which, as provided in &sect;558.4, requires an approved Form FDA 1900 for making a Type C medicated
feed. Therefore, the use of salinomycin, roxarsone, and bacitracin zinc Type A medicated articles to make Type C medicated
feeds as provided in ANADA 200&hyph;143 requires an approved Form FDA 1900. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In accordance with the freedom of information provisions of part 20 (21 CFR part 20) and &sect;514.11(e)(2)(ii) (21

of this application may be seen in the Dockets Management Branch (HFA&hyph;305), Food and Drug Administration, rm.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The United States Housing Act of 1937 (1937 Act) requires the Secretary to publish Fair Market Rents (FMRs) periodically,
but not less frequently than annually, to be effective on October 1 of each year. The 1937 Act also requires that the
assistance contracts signed by owners participating in the Department's Section 8 Housing Assistance Payments
programs provide for annual or more frequent adjustment in the maximum monthly rentals for units covered by the contract
to reflect changes based on fair market rents prevailing in a particular market area, or on a reasonable formula. The
FMR and AAF Notices published on April 6, 1994 (59 FR 16408), and April 26, 1994 (59 FR 21832), respectively, announced
the revised FY 1994 FMRs and Annual Adjustment Factors, but contained some technical errors.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 of February 25, 1994 (59 FR 9167), EPA issued a proposed rule that gave notice that the Interregional Research Project
No. 4 (IR-4), New Jersey Agricultural Experiment Station, P.O. Box 231, Rutgers University, New Brunswick, NJ 08903,
had submitted pesticide petition (PP) 0E3921, as amended, to EPA on behalf of the Agricultural Experiment Stations
of Idaho, Oregon, and Washington, requesting that the Administrator, pursuant to section 408(e) of the Federal Food,
Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FFDCA), 21 U.S.C. 346a(e), establish a tolerance for residues of the pesticide befentrhin,
(2-methyl [1,1'-biphenyl]-3-yl)methyl-3-(2-chloro-3,3,3,-trifluoro-1-propenyl)-2,2-dimethylcyclopropanecarboxylate,
in or on the raw agricultural commodity dried hops at 10.0 parts per million (ppm). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
There were no requests for referral to an advisory committee received in response to the proposed rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One comment was received in response to the proposed rule. The comment, which was submitted by E.I. duPont de Nemours
&amp; Co., Inc. (Dupont), responded to the Agency's request for comments on the reclassification of dried hops as
a raw agricultural commodity. The commenter expressed DuPont's support for the reclassification of all dried fruits
as raw agricultural commodities. EPA is currently reviewing a petition from DuPont requesting the revocation of
the tolerance established under section 409 of the FFDCA for residues of the fungicide benomyl in raisins and the establshment
of a tolerance for benomyl on raisins under section 408 of the FFDCA. DuPont's petition contends that existing section
409 tolerances for raisins are inappropriate since raisins meet the statutory definition of a raw agricultural commodity.
Additional information regarding DuPont's petition can be obtained from the notice of receipt for the petition,
which was published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 of December 2, 1993 (58 FR 63575, Dec. 2, 1993). An evaluation by EPA of the commenter's proposed reclassification
of dried fruit (including raisins) as a raw agricultural commodity was not conducted by EPA in association with the
IR-4 petition for tolerance for bifentrhin residues on hops. EPA will respond to DuPont's proposed recalssification
of raisins in association with the benomyl petition, which is under evaluation by the Agency. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The data submitted relevant to the proposal and other relevant material have been evaluated and discussed in the proposed
rule. Based on the data and information considered, the Agency concludes that the tolerance will protect the public
health. Therefore, the tolerance is established as set forth below.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Any person adversely affected by this regulation may, within 30 days after publication of this document in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 file written objections and/or request a hearing with the Hearing Clerk, at the address given above (40 CFR 178.20).
A copy of the objections and/or hearing requests filed with the Hearing Clerk should be submitted to the OPP docket
for this rulemaking. The objections submitted must specify the provisions of the regulation deemed objectionable
and the grounds for the objections (40 CFR 178.25). Each objection must be accompanied by the fee prescribed by 40 CFR
180.33(i). If a hearing is requested, the objections must include a statement of the factual issue(s) on which a hearing
is requested, the requestor's contentions on such issues, and a summary of any evidence relied upon by the objector
(40 CFR 178.27). A request for a hearing will be granted if the Administrator determines that the material submitted
shows the following: There is a genuine and substantial issue of fact; there is a reasonable possibility that available
evidence identified by the requestor would, if established, resolve one or more of such issues in favor of the requestor,
taking into account uncontested claims or facts to the contrary; and resolution of the factual issue(s) in the manner
sought by the requestor would be adequate to justify the action requested (40 CFR 178.32).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under Executive Order 12866 (58 FR 51735, Oct. 4, 1993), the Agency must determine whether the regulatory action is
``significant'' and therefore subject to review by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) and the requirements
of the Executive Order. Under section 3(f), the order defines a ``significant regulatory action'' as an action that
is likely to result in a rule (1) having an annual effect on the economy of $100 million or more, or adversely and materially
affecting a sector of the economy, productivity, competition, jobs, the environment, public health or safety, or
State, local, or tribal governments or communities (also referred to as ``economically significant''); (2) creating
serious inconsistency or otherwise interfering with an action taken or planned by another agency; (3) materially
altering the budgetary impacts of entitlement, grants, user fees, or loan programs or the rights and obligations
or recipients thereof; or (4) raising novel legal or policy issues arising out of legal mandates, the President's
priorities, or the principles set forth in this Executive Order. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Pursuant to the terms of the Executive Order, EPA has determined that this rule is not ``significant'' and is therefore
not subject to OMB review. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Pursuant to the requirements of the Regulatory Flexibility Act (Pub. L. 96-354, 94 Stat. 1164, 5 U.S.C. 601-612),
the Administrator has determined that regulations establishing new tolerances or raising tolerance levels or establishing
exemptions from tolerance requirements do not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small
entities. A certification statement to this effect was published in the

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 EPA issued rules, published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Registers
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 of June 28, 1990 (55 FR 26438), May 15, 1991 (56 FR 22333), and June 12, 1991 (56 FR 26911), which announced that Nor-Am
Chemical Co. had submitted pesticide petitions (PP 9F3699, 9F3793, and 9F3799) to EPA requesting that the Administrator,
pursuant to section 408(d) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FFDCA), 21 U.S.C. 346a(d), establish tolerances
for clofentezine in or on peaches at 1.0 part per million (ppm) and nectarines at 1.0 ppm (PP 9F3699); almond hulls at
5.00 ppm, almond nutmeat at 0.5 ppm, walnuts at 0.02 ppm (PP 9F3793); apricots at 1.0 ppm and cherries at 1.0 ppm (PP 9F3799).
The Agency established these tolerances with an expiration date of September 30, 1994, to cover residues expected
to be present from use during the period of conditional registration for these uses. The conditional registrations
were to expire September 30, 1993. The Agency recently extended the conditional registration expiration date to
December 31, 1994.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The conditional registration required the following information to be submitted. These studies were required because
the chronic risk of clofentezine to avian and aquatic species could not be fully evaluated.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. Avian reproduction studies (bobwhite quail and mallard duck) were required to be repeated.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. Two aquatic studies, an aquatic invertebrate life-cycle study and a fish life-cycle study, were required.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Studies have been submitted and are currently in review, but a final review is not expected to be completed for some
time. However, the Agency has conducted a preliminary review of these studies and determined that they are scientifically
sound. Therefore, on the basis of Nor-Am's compliance with the requirements of the conditional registration, the
Agency is removing the expiration date for the tolerances of the commodities listed above. In the interim, until the
Agency is able to complete its final review and risk assessment a conditional registration will remain in effect for
the commodities listed above.

make the tolerances permanent for residues on peaches, nectarines, almonds, walnuts, apricots, and cherries and
in or on meat, fat, and meat byproducts of cattle, goats, hogs, horses, and sheep. No comments were received in response
to this notice of filing. As described above, the Agency has decided to remove the expiration date for these tolerances
based on Nor-Am's submittal of the studies requested in the conditional registration.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Based on the 1-year dog-feeding study with a NOEL of 1.25 mg/kg/day and using a safety factory of 100, the acceptable
daily intake (ADI) for humans is 0.013 mg/kg of body weight/day. The current action will contribute .0000519 mg/kg/day
of residue to the human diet utilizing an additional 4.0 percent the ADI. This results in a total utilization of 4.5
percent of the ADI. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The scientific data submitted in the petitions and other relevant material have been reviewed. The toxicological
data considered in support of these tolerances are discussed in detail in previous final rules establishing tolerances
for clofentezine referenced earlier in this document, i.e., the

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The nature of residue is understood. An adequate analytical method, high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC),
is available for enforcement. There are presently no actions pending against the continued registration of this
chemical. This pesticide is considered useful for the purposes for which the tolerances are sought. Based on the information
and data considered, the Agency has determined that the tolerances established by amending 40 CFR part 180 will protect
the public health. Therefore, the tolerances are established as set forth below.

, file written objection and/or request a hearing with the Hearing Clerk, at the address given above (40 CFR 178.20).
A copy of the objections and/or hearing requests filed with the Hearing Clerk should be submitted to the OPP docket
for this rulemaking. The objections submitted must specify the provisions of the regulation deemed objectionable
and the grounds for the objections (40 CFR 178.25). Each objection must be accompanied by the feed prescribed by 40
CFR 180.33(i). If a hearing is requested, the objections must include a statement of the factual issue(s) on which
a hearing is requested, the requestor's contentions on such issues, and a summary of any evidence relied upon by objector
(40 CFR 178.27). A request for a hearing will be granted if the Administrator determines that the material submitted
shows the following: There is genuine and substantial issue of fact; there is reasonable possibility that available
evidence identified by the requestor would, if established, resolve one or more of such issues in favor or the requestor,
taking into account uncontested claims or facts to the contrary: and resolution of the factual issue(s) in the manner
sought by the requestor would be adequate to justify the action requested (40 CFR 17.32).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under Executive Order 12866 (58 FR 51735, Oct. 4, 1993), the Agency must determine whether the regulatory action is
``significant'' and therefore subject to all the requirements of the Executive Order (i.e., Regulatory Impact Analysis,
review by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB). Under section 3(f), the order defines ``significant'' as those
actions likely to lead to a rule (1) having an annual effect on the economy of $100 million or more, or adversely and materially
affecting a sector of the economy, productivity, competition, jobs, the environment, public health or safety, or
State, local or tribal governments or communities (also known as ``economically significant''); (2) creating serious
inconsistency or otherwise interfering with an action taken or planned by another agency; (3) materially altering
the budgetary impacts of entitlement, grants, user fees, or loan programs; or (4) raising novel legal or policy issues
arising out of legal mandates, the President's priorities, or the principles set forth in this Executive Order.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Pursuant to the terms of the Executive Order, EPA has determined that the rule is not ``significant'' and is therefore
not subject to OMB review. Pursuant to the requirements of the Regulatory Flexibility Act (Pub. L. 96-354, 94 Stat.
1164, 5 U.S.C. 601-612), the Administrator has determined that regulations establishing new tolerances or raising
tolerance levels or establishing exemptions from tolerance requirements do not have a significant economic impact
on a substantial number of small entities. A certification statement to this effect was published in the

As part of EPA's evaluation of potential human health risks, propiconazole has been the subject of five Peer Reviews
and one Scientific Advisory Panel (SAP) meeting.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Propiconazole was originally evaluated by the Peer Review Committee on January 15, 1987, and classified as a Group
C (possible human) carcinogen with a recommendation made for the quantification of estimated potential human risk
using a linearized low-dose extrapolation. The method resulted in the establishment of a Q
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->

 of 7.9 X 10

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Peer Review Committee's decision was presented to the FIFRA Scientific Advisory Panel on March 2, 1988. The Panel
did not concur with the committee's overall assessment of the weight-of-evidence on the carcinogenicity of propiconazole.
The Panel recommended placing the chemical in Group D, indicating that the Group C classification was based on minimal
evidence. The Panel's determination that EPA's Group C classification was based on minimal evidence was due to the
fact that the incidence of liver tumors in male mice only occurred when the mice were given an excessive chemical dose.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In the second, third, and fourth Peer Reviews that followed, the Peer Review Committee considered recommendations
of the SAP as well as rebuttals by the registrant. Its conclusion, however, that propiconazole should be classified
as a Group C carcinogen with a quantification of potential human risk remained unchanged.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As part of a fifth Peer Review, EPA considered additional information provided by the registrant in support of the
registrant's argument that the high dose was excessively toxic in the mouse carcinogenicity study. It further argued
that the data from the high dose (2,500 ppm) should not be included in the evaluation of carcinogenic potential of propiconazole.
In support of these arguments, the registrant provided two subchronic oral toxicity studies in mice. Ciba-Geigy
also provided a reread of the pathology slides from a mouse oncogenicity study which it felt indicated sufficient
concurrent liver toxicity at 2,500 ppm to document that this dose was excessive. These findings were not present in
the original pathology report. Owing to the inconsistency in Ciba-Geigy's report and the original report, the Agency
requested that an independent (third) evaluation of the pathology slides be made to determine if the pathology reported
could be confirmed. The results of this (third) pathology evaluation were used in the fifth Peer Review in place of
data resulting from the earlier evaluations provided by Ciba-Geigy.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Peer Review Committee considered the following facts regarding the toxicology data on propiconazole in a weight-of-evidence
determination of carcinogenic potential:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. Increased numbers of adenomas (increased trend and pairwise comparison) were found in the livers of male CD1 mice
given 2,500 ppm of propiconazole in the diet.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. The treated animals had earlier fatalities than the controls.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. The numbers of carcinomas were increased (trend only) in male mice only at the 2,500 ppm dose level. Tumors were not
significantly increased at the 500 ppm dose level. Adenomas observed in the treated animals were larger and more numerous
than those in controls; however, the tumor type (adenoma) was the same.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. No excessive number of tumors was found in female mice.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
5. In a rat study conducted with acceptable doses of propiconazole, no excessive numbers of tumors were found.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Peer Review Committee determined, based on the additional information submitted by Ciba-Geigy from two 90-day
subchronic studies in mice that the 2,500-ppm dose used in the 2-year chronic study exceeded the maximum tolerated
dose (MTD) based on the endpoint of hepatic necrosis, and the 500-ppm dose used in the chronic study was inadequate
to assess the carcinogenicity of propiconazole. Based on the third pathology evaluation of the chronic study, the
Peer Review Committee agreed with Ciba-Geigy's argument that the study showed excessive toxicity at the 2,500 ppm-dose
and concluded that the 90-day subchronic studies are a better measure of what would be an MTD.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Based upon these findings, the Peer Review Committee agreed that the classification for propiconazole should remain
a Group C (possible human) carcinogen and recommended against the previously used Q

. 0.079) for risk assessment purposes. For the purpose of risk characterization the Peer Review Committee recommended
that the reference dose (RfD) approach should be used for quantification of human risk. This decision was based on
the disqualification of the high dose (2,500 ppm), making the data inappropriate for the calculation of Q
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
*
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. Because the middle dose (500 ppm) was not considered sufficiently high enough for assessing the carcinogenetic
potential of propiconazole, EPA has requested an additional mouse study at intermediate dose levels in male mice
only. EPA does not expect that these data will significantly change the above cancer assessment that propiconazole
poses a negligible cancer risk to humans.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The reference dose (RfD) for propiconazole is 0.013 mg/kg/day, based on a no-observable-effect level (NOEL) of 1.25
mg/kg/day and an uncertainty factor of 100. The NOEL is taken from a 1-year feeding study in dogs which demonstrated
as an effect irritation of the stomach in males.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Agency has evaluated dietary exposure to the fungicide residues based on the proposed tolerances and the commodities
which have established tolerances using data on anticipated residues and percent crop treated data. The livestock
burden was calculated using anticipated residues in feed items multiplied by the expected percent contribution
to the diet. This dietary burden was then compared with available data from feeding studies to determine anticipated
residues in meat and milk. Based on current registered uses of this chemical only 7% of the RfD is being utilized for
the general U.S. population. The tolerances are expected to elicit only a minor increase in the percent utilization
of the RfD for the general U.S. population. The most highly exposed subgroups, nursing and nonnursing infants less
than 1 year, have Anticipated Residue Contributions (ARCs) from all published tolerances of 1.97 X 10

Available data on storage stability of propiconazole in peanuts are unacceptable and must be redone for nutmeat,
hulls, and hay. Once review of all required residue data is submitted, the petitioner may resubmit its petition for
permanent tolerances.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The nature of the residue in plants and animals is adequately understood, and adequate analytical methods (gas chromatography)
are available for enforcement purposes. Because of the long lead time for establishing these tolerances and food
additive regulations to publication of the enforcement methodology in the Pesticide Analytical Manual, Vol. II,
the analytical methodology is being made available in the interim to anyone interested in pesticide enforcement
when requested from: Calvin Furlow, Public Information Branch, Field Operations Division (7506C), 401 M St., S.W.,
Washington, DC 20460. Office location and telephone number: Rm. 1128C, CM #2, 1921 Jefferson Davis Hwy., Arlington,
VA 22202, (703)-305-5232.

The pesticide is considered useful for the purpose for which the tolerances are being sought. For the reasons described
above, the Agency is establishing tolerances for residues of 1-[[2-(2,4-dichlorophenyl)-4-propyl-1,3-dioxolan-2-yl]methyl]-1

-1,2,4-triazole and its metabolites, determined as 2,4-dichlorobenzoic acid and expressed as parent compound,
in or on the following raw agricultural commodities: peanuts, 0.2 ppm; peanut hay, 20 ppm; peanut hulls, 1 ppm. Because
of unacceptable storage stability data on peanuts, the Agency is placing a time limitation on these tolerances. However,
based on available data the Agency concludes that the established interim tolerances will protect public health.
Therefore, the tolerances are established as set forth below.

, file written objections with the Hearing Clerk, at the address given above (40 CFR 178.20). The objections submitted
must specify the provisions of the regulation deemed objectionable and the grounds for the objections (40 CFR 178.25).
Each objection must be accompanied by the fee prescribed by 40 CFR 180.33(i). If a hearing is requested, the objections
must include a statement of the factual issue(s) on which a hearing is requested, the requestor's contentions on such
issues, and a summary of any evidence relied upon by the objector (40 CFR 178.127). A request for a hearing will be granted
if the Administrator determines that the material submitted shows the following: There is a genuine and substantial
issue of fact; there is a reasonable possibility that available evidence identified by the requestor would, if established,
resolve one or more of such issues in favor of the requestor, taking into account uncontested claims or facts to the
contrary; and resolution of the factual issue(s) in the manner sought by the requestor would be adequate to justify
the action requested (40 CFR 178.32).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Pursuant to the requirements of the Regulatory Flexibility Act (Pub. L. 96-354, 94 Stat. 1164, 5 U.S.C. 601-612),
the Administrator has determined that regulations establishing new tolerances or food additive regulations or
raising tolerance levels or food additive regulations or establishing exemptions from tolerance requirements
do not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. A certification statement to
this effect was published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 of May 4, 1981 (40 FR 24950).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under Executive Order 12866 (58 FR 51735, October 4, 1993), the Agency must determine whether the regulatory action
is ``significant'' and therefore subject to review by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB). Under section 3(f),
the order defines ``significant regulatory action'' as action that is likely to result in a rule (1) having an annual
effect on the economy of $100 million or more, or adversely and materially affecting a sector of the economy, productivity,
competition, jobs, the environment, public health or safety, or State, local or tribal governments or communities
(also referred to as ``economically significant''); (2) creating serious inconsistency or otherwise interfering
with an action taken or planned by another agency; (3) materially altering the budgetary impacts of entitlement,
grants, user fees, or loan programs; or (4) raising novel legal or policy issues arising out of legal mandates, the
President's priorities, or the principles set forth in this Executive Order. The Office of Management and Budget
has exempted this rule from the requirements of Executive Order 12866.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 of March 30, 1994 (59 FR 14820), EPA issued a proposed rule that gave notice that International Specialty Products,
1361 Alps Rd., Wayne, NJ 07470, had submitted pesticide petitions (PPs) 3E4260 and 3E4261 to EPA requesting that the
Administrator, pursuant to section 408(e) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FFDCA), 21 U.S.C. 346a(e),
propose to amend 40 CFR 180.1001(c) and (e) by establishing an exemption from the requirement of a tolerance for residues
of methyl vinyl ether-maleic acid copolymer (CAS Reg. No. 25153-40-6) (PP 3E4260) and methyl vinyl ether-maleic
acid copolymer calcium sodium salt (CAS Reg. No. 62386&hyph;95&hyph;2) (PP 3E4261) when used as inert ingredients
(dispersant and seed-coating adhesive, respectively) in pesticide formulations applied to growing crops, to raw
agricultural commodities after harvest, or to animals.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
There were no comments or requests for referral to an advisory committee received in response to the proposed rule.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The data submitted on the proposal and other relevant material have been evaluated and discussed in the proposed rule.
Based on the data and information considered, the Agency concludes that the tolerance exemptions will protect the
public health. Therefore, the tolerance exemptions are established as set forth below.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Any person adversely affected by this regulation may, within 30 days after publication of this document in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 file written objections and/or request a hearing with the Hearing Clerk, at the address given above (40 CFR 178.20).
A copy of the objections and/or hearing requests filed with the Hearing Clerk should be submitted to the OPP docket
for this rulemaking. The objections submitted must specify the provisions of the regulation deemed objectionable
and the grounds for the objections (40 CFR 178.25). Each objection must be accompanied by the fee prescribed by 40 CFR
180.33(i). If a hearing is requested, the objections must include a statement of the factual issue(s) on which a hearing
is requested, the requestor's contentions on such issues, and a summary of any evidence relied upon by the objector
(40 CFR 178.27). A request for a hearing will be granted if the Administrator determines that the material submitted
shows the following: There is a genuine and substantial issue of fact; there is a reasonable possibility that available
evidence identified by the requestor would, if established, resolve one or more of such issues in favor of the requestor,
taking into account uncontested claims or facts to the contrary; and resolution of the factual issue(s) in the manner
sought by the requestor would be adequate to justify the action requested (40 CFR 178.32).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under Executive Order 12866 (58 FR 51735, Oct. 4, 1993), the Agency must determine whether the regulatory action is
``significant'' and therefore subject to review by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) and the requirements
of the Executive Order. Under section 3(f), the order defines a ``significant regulatory action'' as an action that
is likely to result in a rule (1) having an annual effect on the economy of $100 million or more, or adversely and materially
affecting a sector of the economy, productivity, competition, jobs, the environment, public health or safety, or
State, local, or tribal governments or communities (also referred to as ``economically significant''); (2) creating
serious inconsistency or otherwise interfering with an action taken or planned by another agency; (3) materially
altering the budgetary impacts of entitlement, grants, user fees, or loan programs or the rights and obligations
of recipients thereof; or (4) raising novel legal or policy issues arising out of legal mandates, the President's
priorities, or the principles set forth in this Executive Order. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Pursuant to the terms of the Executive Order, EPA has determined that this rule is not ``significant'' and is therefore
not subject to OMB review. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Pursuant to the requirements of the Regulatory Flexibility Act (Pub. L. 96-354, 94 Stat. 1164, 5 U.S.C. 601-612),
the Administrator has determined that regulations establishing new tolerances or raising tolerance levels or establishing
exemptions from tolerance requirements do not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small
entities. A certification statement to this effect was published in the

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 In the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 of March 2, 1994 (59 FR 9949), EPA issued a proposed rule that gave notice that the Interregional Research Project No.
4 (IR-4), New Jersey Agricultural Experiment Station, P.O. Box 231, Rutgers University, New Brunswick, NJ 08903,
had submitted pesticide petitions (PP) 9E3752 and 9E3791 to EPA on behalf of the Agricultural Experiment Station
of Florida, requesting that the Administrator, pursuant to section 408(e) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic
Act (FFDCA), 21 U.S.C. 346a(e), amend 40 CFR 180.414 by establishing tolerances for combined residues of the insecticide
cyromazine (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=3 -->
N
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
-cyclopropyl-1,3,5-triazine-2,4,6-triamine) and its metabolite melamine (1,3,5-triazine-2,4,6-triamine),
in or on the raw agricultural commodities Chinese cabbage (PP 9E3752) and Chinese mustard (PP 9E3791) at 3.0 parts
per million (ppm). The petitioner proposed that these uses of cyromazine be limited to Florida based on the geographical
representation of the residue data submitted. Additional residue data will be required to expand the area of usage.
Persons seeking geographically broader registration should contact the Agency's Registration Division at the
address provided above.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
There were no comments or requests for referral to an advisory committee received in response to the proposed rule.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The data submitted relevant to the proposal and other relevant material have been evaluated and discussed in the proposed
rule. Based on the data and information considered, the Agency concludes that the tolerances will protect the public
health. Therefore, the tolerances are established as set forth below.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Any person adversely affected by this regulation may, within 30 days after publication of this document in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 file written objections and/or request a hearing with the Hearing Clerk, at the address given above (40 CFR 178.20).
A copy of the objections and/or hearing requests filed with the Hearing Clerk should be submitted to the OPP docket
for this rulemaking. The objections submitted must specify the provisions of the regulation deemed objectionable
and the grounds for the objections (40 CFR 178.25). Each objection must be accompanied by the fee prescribed by 40 CFR
180.33(i). If a hearing is requested, the objections must include a statement of the factual issue(s) on which a hearing
is requested, the requestor's contentions on such issues, and a summary of any evidence relied upon by the objector
(40 CFR 178.27). A request for a hearing will be granted if the Administrator determines that the material submitted
shows the following: There is a genuine and substantial issue of fact; there is a reasonable possibility that available
evidence identified by the requestor would, if established, resolve one or more of such issues in favor of the requestor,
taking into account uncontested claims or facts to the contrary; and resolution of the factual issue(s) in the manner
sought by the requestor would be adequate to justify the action requested (40 CFR 178.32).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under Executive Order 12866 (58 FR 51735, Oct. 4, 1993), the Agency must determine whether the regulatory action is
``significant'' and therefore subject to review by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) and the requirements
of the Executive Order. Under section 3(f), the order defines a ``significant regulatory action'' as an action that
is likely to result in a rule (1) having an annual effect on the economy of $100 million or more, or adversely and materially
affecting a sector of the economy, productivity, competition, jobs, the environment, public health or safety, or
State, local, or tribal governments or communities (also referred to as ``economically significant''); (2) creating
serious inconsistency or otherwise interfering with an action taken or planned by another agency; (3) materially
altering the budgetary impacts of entitlement, grants, user fees, or loan programs or the rights and obligations
or recipients thereof; or (4) raising novel legal or policy issues arising out of legal mandates, the President's
priorities, or the principles set forth in this Executive Order. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Pursuant to the terms of the Executive Order, EPA has determined that this rule is not ``significant'' and is therefore
not subject to OMB review. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Pursuant to the requirements of the Regulatory Flexibility Act (Pub. L. 96-354, 94 Stat. 1164, 5 U.S.C. 601-612),
the Administrator has determined that regulations establishing new tolerances or raising tolerance levels or establishing
exemptions from tolerance requirements do not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small
entities. A certification statement to this effect was published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

by establishing an exemption from the requirement of a tolerance for residues of vinyl alcohol-vinyl acetate-monomethyl
maleate, sodium salt-maleic acid, disodium salt

-butyrolactone acetic acid, sodium salt copolymer when used as an inert ingredient (carrier) in pesticide formulations
applied to growing crops only.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
There were no comments or requests for referral to an advisory committee received in response to the proposed rule.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The data submitted on the proposal and other relevant material have been evaluated and discussed in the proposed rule.
Based on the data and information considered, the Agency concludes that the tolerance exemption will protect the
public health. Therefore, the tolerance exemption is established as set forth below.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Any person adversely affected by this regulation may, within 30 days after publication of this document in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 file written objections and/or request a hearing with the Hearing Clerk, at the address given above (40 CFR 178.20).
A copy of the objections and/or hearing requests filed with the Hearing Clerk should be submitted to the OPP docket
for this rulemaking. The objections submitted must specify the provisions of the regulation deemed objectionable
and the grounds for the objections (40 CFR 178.25). Each objection must be accompanied by the fee prescribed by 40 CFR
180.33(i). If a hearing is requested, the objections must include a statement of the factual issue(s) on which a hearing
is requested, the requestor's contentions on such issues, and a summary of any evidence relied upon by the objector
(40 CFR 178.27). A request for a hearing will be granted if the Administrator determines that the material submitted
shows the following: There is a genuine and substantial issue of fact; there is a reasonable possibility that available
evidence identified by the requestor would, if established, resolve one or more of such issues in favor of the requestor,
taking into account uncontested claims or facts to the contrary; and resolution of the factual issue(s) in the manner
sought by the requestor would be adequate to justify the action requested (40 CFR 178.32).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under Executive Order 12866 (58 FR 51735, Oct. 4, 1993), the Agency must determine whether the regulatory action is
``significant'' and therefore subject to review by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) and the requirements
of the Executive Order. Under section 3(f), the order defines a ``significant regulatory action'' as an action that
is likely to result in a rule (1) having an annual effect on the economy of $100 million or more, or adversely and materially
affecting a sector of the economy, productivity, competition, jobs, the environment, public health or safety, or
State, local, or tribal governments or communities (also referred to as ``economically significant''); (2) creating
serious inconsistency or otherwise interfering with an action taken or planned by another agency; (3) materially
altering the budgetary impacts of entitlement, grants, user fees, or loan programs or the rights and obligations
of recipients thereof; or (4) raising novel legal or policy issues arising out of legal mandates, the President's
priorities, or the principles set forth in this Executive Order. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Pursuant to the terms of the Executive Order, EPA has determined that this rule is not ``significant'' and is therefore
not subject to OMB review. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Pursuant to the requirements of the Regulatory Flexibility Act (Pub. L. 96-354, 94 Stat. 1164, 5 U.S.C. 601-612),
the Administrator has determined that regulations establishing new tolerances or raising tolerance levels or establishing
exemptions from tolerance requirements do not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small
entities. A certification statement to this effect was published in the

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 of March 30, 1994 (59 FR 14824), EPA issued a proposed rule that gave notice that pursuant to petitions by the Acetochlor

There were no comments or requests for referral to an advisory committee received in response to the proposed rule.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The data submitted on the proposal and other relevant material have been evaluated and discussed in the proposed rule.
Based on the data and information considered, the Agency concludes that the tolerances will protect the public health.
Therefore, the tolerances are established as set forth below.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Any person adversely affected by this regulation may, within 30 days after publication of this document in the

 file written objections and/or request a hearing with the Hearing Clerk, at the address given above (40 CFR 178.20).
A copy of the objections and/or hearing requests filed with the Hearing Clerk should be submitted to the OPP docket
for this rulemaking. The objections submitted must specify the provisions of the regulation deemed objectionable
and the grounds for the objections (40 CFR 178.25). Each objection must be accompanied by the fee prescribed by 40 CFR
180.33(i). If a hearing is requested, the objections must include a statement of the factual issue(s) on which a hearing
is requested, the requestor's contentions on such issues, and a summary of any evidence relied upon by the objector
(40 CFR 178.27). A request for a hearing will be granted if the Administrator determines that the material submitted
shows the following: There is a genuine and substantial issue of fact; there is a reasonable possibility that available
evidence identified by the requestor would, if established, resolve one or more of such issues in favor of the requestor,
taking into account uncontested claims or facts to the contrary; and resolution of the factual issue(s) in the manner
sought by the requestor would be adequate to justify the action requested (40 CFR 178.32).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under Executive Order 12866 (58 FR 51735, Oct. 4, 1993), the Agency must determine whether the regulatory action is
``significant'' and therefore subject to review by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) and the requirements
of the Executive Order. Under section 3(f), the order defines a ``significant regulatory action'' as an action that
is likely to result in a rule (1) having an annual effect on the economy of $100 million or more, or adversely and materially
affecting a sector of the economy, productivity, competition, jobs, the environment, public health or safety, or
State, local, or tribal governments or communities (also referred to as ``economically significant''); (2) creating
serious inconsistency or otherwise interfering with an action taken or planned by another agency; (3) materially
altering the budgetary impacts of entitlement, grants, user fees, or loan programs or the rights and obligations
of recipients thereof; or (4) raising novel legal or policy issues arising out of legal mandates, the President's
priorities, or the principles set forth in this Executive Order. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Pursuant to the terms of the Executive Order, EPA has determined that this rule is not ``significant'' and is therefore
not subject to OMB review. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Pursuant to the requirements of the Regulatory Flexibility Act (Pub. L. 96-354, 94 Stat. 1164, 5 U.S.C. 601-612),
the Administrator has determined that regulations establishing new tolerances or raising tolerance levels or establishing

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 This rule updates Medicare regulations to conform them to certain self-implementing provisions on coverage of services
and payment requirements under the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993 (OBRA 93). OBRA 93 was enacted on August
10, 1993 and several of the cited changes to the statute are already in effect and the others will be shortly. We are also
implementing a related provision of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990 (OBRA 90) as necessary for consistency
and clarity of the OBRA 93 provisions.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
I. Background 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
On August 10, 1993, the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993 (OBRA 93) (Pub. L. 103&hyph;66) was enacted. This
law contains numerous provisions relating to coverage of services and payments for services furnished to Medicare
beneficiaries. Some of these provisions are self-implementing; that is, the provisions are stated in terms that
neither require nor permit exercise of discretion in implementing them. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The plain wording of the law causes a conflict with several of our existing regulations; in other cases, the regulations
simply do not take the amendments into account. We are, therefore, making the necessary changes to incorporate the
new provisions into regulations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A discussion of the individual legislative provisions and the accompanying regulations follows. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

II. Reductions in Payments for Skilled Nursing Facility Services_Elimination of Return on Equity for Proprietary
Skilled Nursing Facilities 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
A. Legislative Provision
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 1861(v)(1)(B) of the Social Security Act (the Act) provides that proprietary skilled nursing facilities
(SNFs) receive, in addition to payments for the costs of providing services, return on equity payments, which provide
the investors in the facilities a return on their investment equivalent to what they would have earned had they invested
the same amount in specified government securities. Section 13503(c) of OBRA 93 amended sections 1861(v)(1)(B)
and 1878(f)(2) of the Act to eliminate payments to SNFs for return on equity capital, applicable to portions of cost
reporting periods beginning on or after October 1, 1993. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
B. Regulations Revision
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
We are revising &sect;413.157(b)(3), Rate of return related to proprietary SNFs, to limit its application to services
furnished before October 1, 1993. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

III. Reductions in Payments for Hospice Services

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
A. Legislative Provision
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Under section 1814(i) of the Act, we pay for hospice services on a daily rate basis. Payments are adjusted by a market
basket percentage increase. Section 13504 of OBRA 93 amended section 1814(i) of the Act to decrease the amount of the
market basket (as defined by section 1886(b)(3)(B)(iii) of the Act) percentage increase that will be applied in fiscal
years (FY) 1994 through 1997. These decreases are: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FY 1994_the market basket percentage increase minus 2 percentage points; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FYs 1995 and 1996_the market basket percentage increase minus 1.5 percentage points; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FY 1997_the market basket percentage increase minus .5 percentage points. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
After FY 1997, the full market basket percentage increase will again apply. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
B. Regulations Revisions
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
We are revising &sect;418.306, Determination of payment rates, by updating paragraph (b)(2) to exclude FYs 1994
through 1997 from the application of the market basket percentage increase without modification and to add a new paragraph
(b)(3) to add the statutory decreases.

IV. Reduction in Part A Premium for Certain Individuals With 30 or More Quarters of Social Security Coverage 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
A. Legislative Provision 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Under section 226(a) of the Act, individuals generally become entitled to benefits under Medicare Part A when they
reach age 65 based on hospital insurance (Part A) taxes they paid under the Federal Insurance Contributions Act (FICA)
while they were working. By paying the Part A portion of the FICA tax, individuals acquire quarters of coverage (QCs),
which are used to insure them for Part A coverage. Insured individuals are not required to pay monthly premiums for
Part A coverage. Under section 1818 of the Act, individuals age 65 or over who do not have enough QCs to be insured for
premium-free Part A may enroll in the Part A program if they pay a monthly premium. The Part A premium is determined under
section 1818(d) of the Act and is based on the actuarial value of benefits under Part A. In addition, under section 1818A
of the Act, disabled individuals who lose eligibility for premium-free Part A solely because they have returned to
work may enroll in Part A if they pay a monthly premium, the amount of which is determined under section 1818(d). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 13508 of OBRA 93 amended section 1818(d) to reduce, on a phased-in basis, the amount of the Part A premium for
workers with 30 or more QCs and for spouses (including surviving spouses) of these workers with 30 or more QCs after
having been married at least one year. The reduction also applies to divorced spouses (including surviving divorced
spouses) of workers with 30 or more QCs provided that, at the time the divorce became final, the worker had 30 or more
QCs and the marriage had lasted for at least 10 years. The reductions are as follows:

paragraph (b)(3) as (b)(4) and revising its contents, which concern rounding off fractions of dollars, to specify
that the paragraph applies to the unreduced and the reduced Part A premium. We are redesignating current paragraphs
(c) through (f) as (d) through (g), respectively.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
A. Legislative Provision 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Under 1861(v)(1)(S)(ii)(I) of the Act, Medicare pays the capital costs of hospitals allocated to outpatient departments
on the basis of reasonable cost principles, subject to a 10 percent reduction through FY 1995. (Sole community hospitals
and rural primary care hospitals are exempt from these reductions.) Section 13521 of OBRA 93 amended section 1861(v)(1)(S)(ii)(I)
of the Act to extend the 10 percent reduction through FY 1998.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Under section 1861(v)(1)(S)(ii)(II) of the Act, Medicare payments for hospital outpatient services made on a reasonable
cost basis and the cost portion of outpatient services paid on the basis of a blended amount are both reduced by 5.8 percent
through FY 1995. Section 13522 of OBRA 93 amended section 1861(v)(1)(S)(ii)(II) of the Act to extend the application
of the reduction through FY 1998.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 1833(i)(2)(A)(iii) of the Act includes in the cost of surgery to insert an intraocular lens during or after
cataract surgery a payment that is reasonable and related to the cost of acquiring the class of lens involved. Section
4151 of Public Law 101&hyph;508 (the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990 (OBRA 90)) froze the amount of payment
for the lens at $200. Section 13533 of OBRA 93 reduced the payment amount for intraocular lenses inserted during or
after cataract surgery in an ambulatory surgical center on or after January 1, 1994 and before January 1, 1999. For
that period, the payment is $150.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Our regulations do not contain the specific amounts allowable for intraocular lenses, which are, instead, contained
in our administrative guidelines. Therefore, we are making no changes to regulations to implement the legislation.

VIII. Payment for Parenteral and Enteral Nutrients, Supplies and Equipment During 1994 and 1995 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
A. Legislative Provision
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1986 (Public Law 99&hyph;509), section 9340 provided that reasonable
charges for parenteral and enteral nutrition supplies and equipment may not exceed the lowest charge levels at which
the supplies and equipment are widely and consistently available. Under our regulations at 42 CFR 405.511(c) those
levels are set at the 25th percentile of the charges for the items or services, in the locality designated by the carrier
for this purpose, during the three month period of July 1 through September 30 preceding the fee screen year for which
the item or service was furnished. Section 13541 of OBRA 93 requires that in determining the amount of Part B payment
for parenteral and enteral nutrients, supplies and equipment during 1994 and 1995, the charges determined to be reasonable
with respect to these items may not exceed the charges determined to be reasonable for them during 1993.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As our payment regulations do not specifically address payments for parenteral and enteral nutrients, supplies

changes in our program manuals.

Section 1833(g) of the Act limits the amount payable annually for covered outpatient physical and occupational therapy
services provided by independently practicing physical and occupational therapists. Section 6133(a) of the Omnibus
Budget Reconciliation of 1989 (OBRA 89) (Pub. L. 101&hyph;239) amended section 1833(g) of the Act to increase the
maximum amount of incurred expenses that can be recognized for payment purposes from $500 to $750, for services furnished
on or after January 1, 1990, and section 13555 of OBRA 93 amended section 1833(g) of the Act to increase the maximum amount
of incurred expenses that can be recognized for payment purposes from $750 to $900, effective for services furnished
on or after January 1, 1994.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Under section 1861(aa) of the Act, Medicare pays for services furnished in certain qualified health centers that
are known as Federally qualified health centers (FQHCs). Each center is: An entity that is receiving a grant under
section 329, 330, or 340 of the Public Health Service Act or is under contract with the recipient of a grant under section
329, 330, or 340 of the Public Health Service Act and meets the requirements for receiving such a grant; or is determined,
based on the recommendations of the Health Resources and Services Administration within the Public Health Service,
to meet the requirements for meeting such a grant; or was treated by the Secretary as a comprehensive Federally funded
health center as of January 1, 1990. Section 13556 of OBRA 93 amended section 1861(aa)(4) of the Act to include as FQHCs
outpatient programs and facilities operated by Indian tribes or tribal organizations under the Indian Self-Determination
Act (25 U.S.C. 450). The amendment took effect as if included in the enactment of section 4161(a)(2)(C) of OBRA 90,
which was effective October 1, 1991. Section 13556 of OBRA 93 also provides that an outpatient health program or facility
operated by an urban Indian organization receiving funds under Title V of the Indian Health Care Improvement Act (25
U.S.C. 1601ff) is included in the Medicare program, effective October 1, 1991.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Medicare is the principle purchaser of epoetin (EPO), an anti-anemia drug used by dialysis patients with a specified
level of anemia. Section 1881(b)(11)(B) of the Act provides that payments to ESRD facilities are made based on increments
of 1,000 unit doses, rounded to the nearest 100 units, with a maximum payment of $11 per 1,000 units. Under section 1861(s)(2)(P)
of the Act, Medicare considers as a medical or other health service EPO for home dialysis patients competent to use
the drug in the home without medical or other supervision, subject to methods and standards established by the Secretary
by regulation for the safe and effective use of the drug, and items related to the use of the drug. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 13566 of OBRA 93 decreased the maximum payment for EPO to $10 per 1,000 units. OBRA 93 also amended section 1861(s)(2)(P)
to remove the word ``home'' from ``home dialysis patients'', the effect of which is to allow coverage of EPO when used
at home by dialysis patients who do not dialyze at home. The effective date of section 13566 of OBRA is January 1, 1994.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The change in payment rate requires no revision to regulations because we announce the rate in a notice published in
the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 rather than in regulations. To implement the provision allowing dialysis patients who do not dialyze at home to use
EPO in the home, we are revising &sect;&sect;405.2137, 405.2163, 410.10(k), and 410.52 to show the effective dates
of the various sections for use of EPO at home by patients who do not dialyze at home.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 1839(e) of the Act establishes the amount of the Medicare Part B premium at 50 percent of the monthly actuarial
rate for enrollees age 65 and over for months in calendar years 1984 through 1990; section 4301 of the Omnibus Budget
Reconciliation Act of 1990 added specific premiums for 1991 through 1995 based on Congressional Budget Office estimates,
at the time, of premium amounts that would equal 50 percent of that actuarial rate. Section 13571 of OBRA 93 amended
section 1839(e) of the Act to again have the premium determined annually so that it equals 50 percent of the monthly
actuarial rate for enrollees age 65 and over for calendar years 1996, 1997 and 1998.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
To reflect OBRA 90 and 93 we are revising 42 CFR 408.20, Monthly premiums, by adding calendar years 1991 through 1995,
and calendar years after 1998, to the heading and content of paragraph (b), which currently contains the methodology
for the period July 1976 through December 1983 and the periods after 1990. We are specifying that the rates cited in
section 1839(e)(1)(B) of the Act apply to 1991 through 1995. To reflect OBRA 93, we are adding calendar years 1996 through
1998 to the heading and content of paragraph (c), which currently discusses the methodology for determining premiums
for calendar years 1984 through 1990.

XIII. Waiver of Proposed Rulemaking 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
We ordinarily publish a notice of proposed rulemaking for a regulation in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 and provide a period for public comment. However, we may waive that procedure if we find good cause that prior notice
and comment are impracticable, unnecessary, or contrary to the public interest. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As noted earlier, this rule updates our rules to properly reflect explicit statutory requirements that are clear
on their face and that we are not interpreting in any way beyond their commonly understood meanings. Without these
changes, certain regulation requirements are in conflict with the statute, possibly misleading those who rely on
our regulations. In addition, some of the statutory changes included in these regulations have been enacted with
retroactive effective dates or effective dates close to the date of enactment of OBRA 93. Under these circumstances,
prompt publication of the correct up-to-date rules best serves those governed by these regulations. Because this
rule does not create any legal requirements and because publishing a notice of proposed rulemaking here would perpetuate
conflicts between clear statutory directives and our regulations, we find that publishing a notice of proposed rulemaking
before issuing this final rule would be unnecessary and contrary to the public interest. However, we are providing
a 60-day comment period for public comments on the final rule as indicated at the beginning of this rule.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

XIV. Response to Comments 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Because of the large number of items of correspondence we normally receive on FR documents published for comment,
we are not able to acknowledge or respond to them individually. We will consider all comments we receive by the date
and time specified in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
DATES
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 section of this preamble, and, if we proceed with a subsequent document, we will respond to the comments in the preamble
to that document. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
XV. Regulatory Impact Statement 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
We generally prepare a regulatory flexibility analysis that is consistent with the Regulatory Flexibility Act (RFA)
(5 U.S.C. 601 through 612) unless the Secretary certifies that a final rule will not have a significant economic impact
on a substantial number of small entities. For purposes of the RFA, all Medicare-participating facilities are considered
to be small entities. Individuals and States are not included in the definition of small entity. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Also, section 1102(b) of the Act requires the Secretary to prepare a regulatory impact analysis if a final rule will
have a significant impact on the operations of a substantial number of small rural hospitals. This analysis must conform
to the provisions of section 604 of the RFA. For purposes of section 1102(b) of the Act, we define a small rural hospital
as a hospital that is located outside of a Metropolitan Statistical Area and has fewer than 50 beds. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This final rule with comment period updates our regulations to incorporate numerous self-implementing statutory
provisions that are not interrelated. None of the regulations interprets or extends requirements beyond those included
in the self-implementing legislation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The amendments to which this rule pertains are already in effect or will go into effect independent of the publication
of this rule. Consequently, there are no actions to be taken that would flow from further analyses of the impact of these
provisions on entities. Therefore, we are not preparing analyses for either the RFA or section 1102(b) of the Act since
we have determined, and the Secretary certifies, that this proposed rule would not result in a significant economic
impact on a substantial number of small entities and would not have a significant economic impact on the operations
of a substantial number of small rural hospitals. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In accordance with the provisions of E.O. 12866, this final rule with comment period was not reviewed by the Office
of Management and Budget.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
I. Background 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Under Medicare, hospitals are paid for inpatient 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
hospital services that they furnish to beneficiaries under 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Part A (Hospital Insurance). Currently, most hospitals are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
paid for their inpatient hospital services under the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
prospective payment systems for operating and capital costs 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in accordance with sections 1886(d) and (g) of the Social 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Security Act (the Act) and 42 CFR part 412. Under these 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
systems, Medicare payment is made at a predetermined, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
specific rate for each hospital discharge based on the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
information contained on actual bills submitted. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 1886(f)(1)(A) of the Act provides that the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Secretary will maintain a system for reporting costs of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
hospitals paid under the prospective payment systems. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 412.52 requires all hospitals participating in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
prospective payment systems to meet the recordkeeping and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
cost reporting requirements of &sect;&sect;413.20 and 413.24, which 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
include submitting a cost report for each 12-month period. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The hospitals and hospital units that are excluded from 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the prospective payment systems are generally paid an amount 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
based on the reasonable cost of services furnished to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
beneficiaries. The inpatient operating costs of these 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
hospitals and hospital units are subject to the ceiling on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the rate of hospital cost increases in accordance with 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
section 1886(b) of the Act and &sect;413.40. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Sections 1815(a) and 1833(e) of the Act provide that no 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
payments will be made to a hospital unless it has furnished 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the information, requested by the Secretary, needed to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
determine the amount of payments due the hospital under the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Medicare program. In general, hospitals submit this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
information through cost reports that cover a 12-month 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
period. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
All hospitals participating in the Medicare program, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
whether they are paid on a reasonable cost basis or under 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the prospective payment systems, are required under 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&sect;413.20(a) to ``maintain sufficient financial records and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
statistical data for proper determination of costs payable 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
under the program.'' In addition, hospitals must use 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
standardized definitions and follow accepted accounting, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
statistical, and reporting practices. Under the provisions 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of &sect;&sect;413.20(b) and 413.24(f), hospitals are required to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
submit cost reports annually, with the reporting period 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
based on the hospital's accounting year.

II. Legislation Concerning Electronic Reporting 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
On December 22, 1987, the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Act of 1987, Public Law 100&hyph;203, was enacted. Section 4007 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of Public Law 100&hyph;203, which was subsequently amended by 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
section 411(b)(6) of the Medicare Catastrophic Coverage Act 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of 1988, Public Law 100&hyph;360, added section 1886(f)(1)(B) of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the Act, which sets forth several provisions concerning the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reporting of hospital information under the Medicare 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
program. Section 1886(f)(1)(B) of the Act applies to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
hospital cost reporting periods beginning on or after 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
October 1, 1989. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 1886(f)(1)(B)(i) of the Act provides that the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Secretary will place into effect a standardized electronic 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
cost reporting format for hospitals under Medicare. This 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
standardized electronic cost reporting format does not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
require any additional data from hospitals. Section 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1886(f)(1)(B)(ii) of the Act provides that the Secretary may 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
delay or waive the implementation of the electronic format 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in instances where such implementation would result in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
financial hardship for a hospital. As an example of a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
financial hardship situation, this section of the Act 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
specifically mentions hospitals with a small percentage of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
inpatients entitled to Medicare benefits. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
III. Provisions of the Proposed Regulations 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
On August 19, 1991, we published a proposed rule (56 FR 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
41110) to implement sections 1886(f)(1)(B) (i) and (ii) of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the Act. We proposed that cost reports be submitted in a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
standardized electronic format. The hospital's cost report 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
software must be able to produce a standardized output file 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in American Standard Code for Information Interchange 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ASCII) format. All intermediaries have the ability to read 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
this standardized file and produce an accurate cost report. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed rule did not require the reporting of any 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
additional information. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If a hospital refuses to submit the cost reports 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
electronically, Medicare payments to that hospital may be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
suspended under the provisions of sections 1815(a) and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1833(e) of the Act. As explained above, sections 1815(a) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and 1833(e) of the Act provide that no Medicare payments 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
will be made to a hospital unless it has furnished the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
information, requested by the Secretary, needed to determine 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the amount of payments due the hospital under the Medicare 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
program. Section 405.371(d) provides for suspension of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Medicare payments to a hospital by the intermediary if the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
hospital has failed to submit information requested by the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
intermediary that is needed to determine the amount due the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
hospital under Medicare. The general procedures that are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
followed when Medicare payment to a hospital is suspended 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for failure to submit information that is needed by the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
intermediary to determine Medicare payment (that is, when a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
hospital fails to furnish a cost report, furnishes an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
incomplete cost report, fails to furnish other needed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
information, or fails to submit a cost report 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
electronically) are located in section 2231 of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Intermediary Manual (HCFA Pub. 13). These procedures 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
include timeframes for ``demand letters'' to hospitals, which 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in addition to reminding hospitals to file timely and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
complete cost reports, explain possible adjustments of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Medicare payments to a hospital and the right to request a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
30-day extension of the due date. If a hospital believes 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that implementation of the electronic submission requirement 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
would cause a financial hardship, the hospital should submit 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a written request for a waiver or a delay of these 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requirements, with supporting documentation, to the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
hospital's intermediary.

Comment:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 A few commenters requested clarification 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
concerning the format for electronic reporting. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 HCFA provided approved vendors of cost 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reporting software with a uniform standardized format for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the creation of the required ASCII file. This format shows 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
how each unique record must be displayed in the electronic 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
file in terms of worksheet, line, and column position. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
specifications required to complete a computerized Medicare 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Cost Report have been in effect since the inception of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Automated Desk Review (ADR) program in 1983. There are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
presently three vendors approved by HCFA for the ADR system. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Eight other commercial vendors are approved by HCFA for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
electronic compilation of the Medicare cost report. A 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
hospital may use any of the 11 vendors for purposes of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
filing an electronically prepared cost report. Each of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
11 vendors must undergo periodic testing in which it 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
develops and submits to HCFA a completed cost report to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
demonstrate its system's ability to conform to HCFA's 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
display standards. No hospital may file its cost report 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
electronically unless the commercial software system it uses 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
has completed the testing process and been approved by HCFA. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition, when the provider files the cost report 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
with the intermediary, the cost report must pass edits 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
specified in the Provider Reimbursement Manual, Part II, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
before the intermediary can accept it. If the cost report 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
fails to pass these edits the intermediary will immediately 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reject the cost report and return it to the provider for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
correction. The cost report will be considered late if the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
provider fails to correct it before the due date. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
provider will be subject to withholding of interim payments 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
until the intermediary receives the corrected cost report. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

Comment:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Several commenters questioned the need to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
file a hard copy cost report in addition to submitting the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
electronic cost report. Additionally, commenters were 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
concerned with the lack of a written statement certifying 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the accuracy of the electronic cost report. One commenter 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
suggested that HCFA require providers to submit a written 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
certification with the electronic cost report. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 We agree with the commenters concerns 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
regarding the need to file a hard copy cost report and the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
lack of a statement certifying the accuracy of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
electronic file. Therefore, effective for cost reporting 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
periods ending on or after October 1, 1994, we are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
eliminating the requirement that providers file a hard copy 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of the cost report in addition to the electronic file. In 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
new &sect;413.24(f)(4)(iii), we specify that instead of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a hard copy cost report, providers must submit a hard copy 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of the certification statement, settlement summary, and a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
statement of certain worksheet totals found within the cost 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
report file. We note that the certification statement 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
provides that in signing the statement, the provider's 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
administrator or chief financial officer is certifying the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
accuracy of the data contained in the electronic cost report 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
or, if the provider has filed a manually prepared report, in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the hard copy cost report. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
We believe that these changes will reduce the burden on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
providers and ensure the accuracy of the data contained in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the electronic file. However, we also need to ensure that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the electronic cost report is not altered once it leaves the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
provider. Thus, in conjunction with the changes made based 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
on public comment, we are implementing a series of changes 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
designed to preserve the integrity of the electronic cost 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
report once the provider files it with the intermediary. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
First, we are specifying in new &sect;413.24(f)(4)(ii) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that the provider's software must be capable of disclosing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that changes have been made to the cost report file after 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the provider has submitted it to the intermediary. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Specifically, electronic cost reporting software will be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
modified so that the cost report will calculate a ``hash 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
total'', that is, a number representing the sum of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
worksheet totals (mentioned above) contained in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
provider's as filed cost report. If any data in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
electronic file is changed after the hash total is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
calculated, the electronic file will disclose that a change 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
has been made. We will instruct all automated data 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reporting vendors to develop the capability to calculate 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
hash totals and disclose changes for all their provider 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
clients. Second, we are specifying in regulations that an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
intermediary may not alter a cost report once it has been 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
filed by a hospital and must reject any cost report that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
does not pass all specified edits and return it to the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
provider for correction. Third, HCFA will make periodic 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
checks to ensure that the totals in the electronic file 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
agree with those totals certified by the provider's 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
administrator or chief financial officer. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Because providers may not have anticipated such 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
substantial changes as a result of this rule, we are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
soliciting comments concerning the requirement in new 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&sect;413.24(f)(4)(ii) that cost report software be able to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
disclose changes to the electronic file made after the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
provider has submitted it to the intermediary. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

Comment:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 One commenter requested that the intermediary 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
be required to report back to the provider in electronic 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
cost reporting format the audit adjustments made to the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
provider's cost report. This would allow providers to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
readily add the audit adjustments to the electronic cost 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
report for future reference. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 We recognize the merit of this suggestion 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and will consider implementing this process in the future. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The intermediaries would need additional computer 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
programming to be able to provide hospitals with an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
electronic file of audit adjustments. We will discuss the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
commenter's suggestion with the 11 approved vendors of cost 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
report software to determine the extent of additional 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
programming needed and the financial implications.

Comment:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Several commenters requested guidance concerning the process for seeking a delay in or waiver from the electronic
submission requirement. The commenters also wanted to know under what circumstances HCFA would grant a delay or waiver.
Commenters suggested that HCFA define the term ``financial hardship'' as used in the proposed rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Provider Reimbursement Manual, part II, section 130, provides the guidelines for requesting a waiver. Basically,
the provider must make a written request to the intermediary at least 120 days before the close of the provider's cost
reporting period. The intermediary reviews the request and forwards it, with a recommendation for approval or denial,
to HCFA's central office within 30 days of receipt of the request. The central office informs the intermediary whether
the waiver is approved or denied within 60 days of receipt of the request in the central office. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Because of the varying financial circumstances of hospitals and other health care providers that participate in
the Medicare program, we believe that it would be inappropriate to establish a definition of ``financial hardship''
or a set of specific criteria that a provider would need to meet to qualify for a waiver of the electronic cost reporting
requirement. We believe that the best method for determining whether a provider qualifies for a waiver is to consider
requests on a case by case basis. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
To date, we have received only eight requests for waiver. We believe that the small number of requests indicates that
the majority of providers will not experience financial hardship as a result of electronic cost reporting. In addition,
in an effort to minimize the number of providers that need a waiver, we developed a software package that will enable
the hospital to file an electronic data set to its fiscal intermediary in order to generate an electronic cost report.
We are providing the software package to hospitals free of charge. Therefore, we believe that with the availability
of the free software, it will be difficult for a provider to demonstrate financial hardship.

Comment:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 A commenter recommended that HCFA provide an automatic waiver of electronic cost report filing in each instance in
which a waiver of standard or full cost reporting has been granted, including those cases where full cost reporting
has been waived because of a low percentage of Medicare inpatients. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 HCFA will grant an automatic waiver of electronic cost reporting if a provider is exempt from full or standard cost
reporting. To qualify for an automatic waiver of electronic cost reporting, the provider must apply and qualify for
an exemption from full or standard cost reporting in accordance with the rules that provide for the exemption. For
example, a provider that does not furnish any covered services to Medicare beneficiaries is exempt from filing a full
cost report and instead must submit an abbreviated report under &sect;413.24(g). Additionally, a provider with
low program utilization may obtain a waiver from filing a full cost report in accordance with &sect;413.24(h). When
the intermediary notifies a provider that it qualifies for an exemption from filing a full cost report, the provider
also will be notified of the exemption from electronic filing. Providers must apply for a waiver of full cost reporting
for each new cost reporting period. Providers that are not exempt from full cost reporting must file for a waiver according
to the procedure set forth in section 130 of the Provider Reimbursement Manual, part II, as discussed above.

Comment:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Commenters requested HCFA's position 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
regarding the penalties assessed against a provider for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
failing to file its cost report electronically. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Sections 1815(a) and 1833(e) of the Act 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
provide that no payments will be made to a hospital unless 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
it has furnished the information requested by the Secretary 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
needed to determine the amount of payments due the hospital 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
under the Medicare program. Section 405.371(d) provides for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
suspension of Medicare payments to a hospital by the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
intermediary if the hospital fails to submit a cost report, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
submits an incomplete cost report, or fails to furnish other 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
needed information. Section 2409.1(A)(1) of the Provider 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Reimbursement Manual (PRM 15&hyph;I) addresses the procedures an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
intermediary will follow when a provider fails to submit a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
cost report or when the cost report is overdue. Unless the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
provider has received a waiver from electronic cost 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reporting, the intermediary will consider a timely filed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
cost report that is not filed electronically as an overdue 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
cost report for purposes of section 2409.1(A)(1). We will 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
update this section of the manual to reflect our position 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
regarding sanctions for failure to file cost reports 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
electronically.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Comment:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 A commenter disagreed with our statement in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the impact analysis of the proposed rule that hospitals 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
would not be significantly affected by electronic cost 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reporting. The commenter stated that some hospitals had to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
make expensive changes in personnel or software to comply 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
with the regulations and that the cost of maintaining the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
required software was an additional burden on providers. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The commenter suggested that HCFA pay providers for the cost 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of implementing the electronic cost reporting requirement 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
including the cost of equipment, software, additional 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
personnel, external consultants, and any related overhead 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
costs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Section 1886(f)(1)(B) of the Act does not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
authorize HCFA to subsidize any of the costs hospitals incur 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in implementing electronic cost reporting. However, it does 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
authorize the waiver or delay of the implementation of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
electronic format in cases of financial hardship. As 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
discussed above, if computer support required for electronic 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
cost reporting will cause financial hardship, the hospital 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
may request a waiver from electronic filing. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
V. Provisions of the Final Regulations 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In this final rule with comment, we are revising the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
provisions set forth in the proposed rule. Based on public 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
comment, we are eliminating the requirement that providers 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
file a hard copy cost report in addition to the electronic 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
file. Also based on public comment, we are adding a new 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
paragraph (iii) to &sect;413.24(f)(4) to provide that in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
addition to the electronic file, a hospital must submit hard 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
copies of a settlement summary, a statement of certain 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
worksheet totals found in the electronic file, and a signed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
statement certifying the accuracy of the electronic file or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the manually prepared cost report. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition to the changes made based on public 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
comment, we are adding a new paragraph (ii) to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&sect;413.24(f)(4) to provide the following: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;All cost reporting software must be able to disclose 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that changes have been made to the electronic file after the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
provider has submitted its cost report to the intermediary. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;The intermediary may not alter the cost report once it 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
has been filed by the provider. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;The intermediary rejects any cost report that does not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
pass all specified edits and returns it to the provider for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
correction. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As a result of the above changes to the regulations 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
text, proposed &sect;413.24(f)(4)(ii) has been 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
redesignated as &sect;413.24(f)(4)(iv). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
VI. Collection of Information Requirements 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 413.24 of this final rule with comment 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
contains information collection and recordkeeping 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requirements that are subject to review by the Office of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Management and Budget (OMB) under the Paperwork Reduction 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Act of 1980 (44 U.S.C. 3501 et seq.). These information 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
collection and recordkeeping requirements are not effective 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
until they have been approved by OMB. We have submitted a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
copy of this final rule with comment to OMB for review of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the information collection requirements. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Approximately 90 percent of hospitals participating in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Medicare have filed electronic cost reports before the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
effective date of this regulation, that is with cost 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reporting periods beginning on or after October 1, 1989. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
These providers will now have to file a diskette containing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the required cost report data in a standard format. This 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
diskette will contain input data only. We believe that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
minimal time would be needed for hospitals to become 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
familiar with the revised software furnished by their cost 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reporting vendor. The remaining 10 percent of the hospitals 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
previously filed manually prepared cost reports. While 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
these hospitals will initially experience an additional 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reporting burden, we believe that once they are familiar 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
with electronic reporting, there will no longer be an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
additional burden and there may even be a decrease in burden 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
since the time needed to compute the cost report will no 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
longer be required. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

VII. Response to Comments 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Because of the number of items of correspondence we normally receive on 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 documents published for comment, we are not able to acknowledge or respond to them individually. We will consider
comments we receive by the date and time specified in the ``DATES'' section of this preamble, and, if we proceed with
a final rule, we will respond to comments in the preamble to that document. Specifically, we are soliciting comments
concerning the requirement in new &sect;413.24(f)(4)(ii) that cost reporting software be able to detect changes
made to the electronic file after the provider has submitted it to the intermediary. We will not consider comments
concerning provisions that remain unchanged from the August 19, 1991 proposed rule or provisions that were changed
based on public comment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
VIII. Impact Statement 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Unless the Secretary certifies that a final rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number
of small entities, we generally prepare a regulatory flexibility analysis that is consistent with the Regulatory
Flexibility Act (RFA) (5 U.S.C. 601 through 612). For purposes of the RFA, all hospitals and small businesses that
distribute cost-report software to hospitals are considered to be small entities. Intermediaries are not included
in the definition of a small entity. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 1102(b) of the Act requires the Secretary to prepare a regulatory impact analysis if a final rule may have a
significant impact on the operations of a substantial number of small rural hospitals. Such an analysis must conform
to the provisions of section 603 of the RFA. For purposes of section 1102(b) of the Act, we define a small rural hospital
as a hospital that has fewer than 50 beds and is located outside of a Metropolitan Statistical Area. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under the provisions of &sect;&sect;413.20(b) and 413.24(f), hospitals are required to submit cost reports annually,
with reporting periods based on the hospital's accounting year. This is generally a consecutive 12-month period.
Section 1886(f)(1)(B)(i) of the Act now requires the use of a standardized electronic cost reporting format for hospitals.
There are approximately 11 national software suppliers that distribute cost report software packages to hospitals.
In addition, HCFA offers a cost reporting software package that is available at no expense to any hospital that requests
it. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As discussed in the proposed rule, computer software suppliers and hospitals that purchased their software will
not be significantly affected by these provisions. Suppliers will not need to develop new software and hospitals
will not need to purchase new software but only revise the software or have the cost report portion of the software revised
based on standard format requirements set by HCFA. Although the cost report portion of software packages will be exactly
the same, competition among suppliers will not be adversely affected since each offers other features that make its
product unique. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Hospitals that will be most affected by this final rule with comment period are those that may be unable to afford the
equipment to submit electronically. These hospitals might include hospitals that have very few Medicare beneficiaries
and small rural hospitals. Hospitals that have access to computer equipment can utilize and benefit from HCFA's free
software if they are unable to afford the software that is available from suppliers. However, as stated above, we have
received only eight requests for waiver of electronic cost reporting. We believe that the small number of requests
indicates that the vast majority of hospitals will not experience financial hardship due to the requirements of this
final rule with comment period. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In conclusion, this final rule with comment period will not have a significant effect on hospital costs since hospitals
will not be required to collect any additional data beyond that which the regulations currently specify; cost-report
software is available at no cost from HCFA to any hospital that requests it; and most hospitals have some type of computer
equipment through which they are currently submitting electronically prepared cost reports. Hospitals will only
be affected to the extent that all would be required to submit cost reports in a standardized electronic format to their
respective intermediary. A hospital that does not comply with the provisions of this rule, as specified in the preamble,
will be subject to sections 1815(a) and 1833(e) of the Act, which provide that no payments will be made to a hospital
unless it has furnished the information requested by the Secretary that is needed to determine the amount of payments
due the hospital under Medicare. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This final rule with comment period will not have a significant effect on a substantial number of Medicare participating
hospitals or software suppliers. Therefore, a regulatory flexibility analysis is not required. We are not preparing
a rural impact statement since the Secretary certifies that this final rule with comment period will not have a significant
economic impact on the operation of a substantial number of small rural hospitals. In accordance with the provisions
of Executive Order 12866, this regulation was not reviewed by the Office of Management and Budget.

 (i) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Effective for cost reporting periods beginning on or after 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
October 1, 1989, a hospital is required to submit its cost 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reports in a standardized electronic format. The hospital's 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
electronic program must be capable of producing the HCFA 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
standardized output file in a form that can be read by 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
intermediary's automated system. This electronic file, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
which must contain the input data required to complete the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
cost report and the data required to pass specified edits, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
is forwarded to the fiscal intermediary for processing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
through its system. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) The fiscal intermediary may not alter the cost 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
report once it has been filed by the hospital. If a cost 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
report does not pass all specified edits, the fiscal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
intermediary rejects the cost report and returns it to the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
hospital for correction. The hospital's electronic program 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
must be able to disclose that changes have been made to the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
electronic cost report after the provider has submitted it 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to the intermediary. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) Effective for cost reporting periods ending on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
or after October 1, 1994, a hospital must submit a hard copy 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of a settlement summary, a statement of certain worksheet 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
totals found within the electronic file, and a statement 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
signed by its administrator or chief financial officer 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
certifying the accuracy of the electronic file or the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
manually prepared cost report. The following statement must 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
immediately precede the dated signature of the hospital's 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
administrator or chief financial officer:

(iv) A hospital may request a delay or waiver of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
electronic submission requirement in paragraph (f)(4)(i) of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
this section if this requirement would cause a financial 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
hardship. The hospital must submit a written request for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
delay or waiver with necessary supporting documentation to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
its intermediary at least 120 days prior to the end of its 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
cost reporting period. The intermediary reviews the request 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and forwards it with a recommendation for approval or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
denial, to HCFA central office within 30 days of receipt of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the request. HCFA central office either approves or denies 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the request and notifies the intermediary within 60 days of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
receipt of the request.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 -->
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Write-Your-Own (WYO) Program (established in 1983) was authorized pursuant to Subpart C, part 62 of the National
Flood Insurance Program (NFIP) regulations and section 1345 of the National Flood Insurance Act of 1968, as amended
(Pub. L. 90&hyph;448, 42 U.S.C. 4001, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=3 -->
et seq.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Under the WYO Program, the Standard Flood Insurance Policy (the form and substance of which is approved by the Federal
Insurance Administrator (the Administrator)) may be issued in their own names by insurers signatory to Financial
Assistance/Subsidy Arrangements. Insurers then are responsible for all aspects of service, including policy issuance
to new policyholders and to policyholders insured by them under other lines of property insurance; endorsement and
renewal of policies; and the adjustment of claims brought under the policies. The insurers retain a specified amount
of the premium for their expenses, including the commissions of agents. Under the Arrangement, the Government provides
such additional funds as may be required, over and above the net premium income, for the payment of claims.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Once the Arrangement is signed by the authorized official of the private insurer and the Government, it is effective
at the beginning of the Government's Fiscal Year on October 1 and runs through the following September 30. Also, in
accordance with Article V_Commencement and Termination of the Arrangement, the Federal Insurance Administration
(FIA) is required, by June 1 of each year, to publish in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 the terms for the re-subscription of the Arrangement for the next Arrangement Year.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This interim rule amends the National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP) regulations dealing with the marketing of flood
insurance policies, at Article II_Undertakings of the Company, paragraph G. of the Arrangement, by requiring the
WYO Company to follow marketing guidelines established by the Federal Insurance Administration (FIA). FIA is currently
developing marketing guidelines which will then be established in consultation with representatives of the WYO
Companies.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As a result of the heavy flood losses which occurred in recent years (i.e., Hurricanes Andrew and Iniki in August and
September 1992, the Northeaster storm in December 1992, the blizzard of March 1993, and the Midwest flooding in the
summer of 1993), FEMA recently had to exercise its borrowing authority for the first time in eight years. While the
Program has been growing modestly, greater increases in the policyholder base are needed to provide additional premium
dollars to build up the reserves to meet future catastrophic flooding events. Further, large numbers of the victims
of recent flood disasters were not protected by flood insurance. Therefore, FEMA has determined that sufficient
cause exists for making this rule effective immediately so the revised Arrangement can be the basis of the Offer required
by June 1 and that delaying the effective date until after a comment period would be impracticable and contrary to the
public interest. However, comments are requested and will be considered before further regulations are issued.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Publication of the Arrangement in this interim rule also constitutes, for the WYO Program Arrangement year of October
1, 1994_September 30, 1995, the Administrator's ``Offer to Assist Insurers in Underwriting Flood Insurance Using
the Standard Flood Insurance Policy.''

Method of Acceptance of Offer
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
1. Acceptance of this offer shall be by mailed notice of acceptance or signed Arrangement to the Administrator `prior
to midnight EDT September 30, 1994. The notice may be preceded by facsimile transmission (202) 646&hyph;3445 which
must be received by midnight EDT September 30, 1994.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. The facsimile transmission or mailed notice of acceptance to the Administrator must be authorized by an official
of the insurance company who has the authority to enter into such arrangements.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. A duly signed original copy of the Notice of Acceptance (see No. 6 below) must be on file with the Administrator by

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. If 1., 2., or 3. above are not satisfied, the acceptance will be considered by the Administrator as conditional and
the commitment of NFIP resources to fulfill the ``Undertaking of the Government'' under Article IV of the Arrangement
will take a lower priority than those needed to fulfill the requirement of the other participating insurance companies.

Article I_Findings, Purpose, and Authority 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
Whereas, the Congress in its ``Finding and Declaration of Purpose'' in the National Flood Insurance Act of 1968, as
amended, (``the Act'') recognized the benefit of having the National Flood Insurance Program (the Program) ``carried
out to the maximum extent practicable by the private insurance industry''; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Whereas, the Federal Insurance Administration (FIA) recognizes this Arrangement as coming under the provisions
of Section 1345 of the Act; and

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
Whereas, the goal of the FIA is to develop a program with the insurance industry where, over time, some risk-bearing
role for the industry will evolve as intended by the Congress (Section 1304 of the Act); and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Whereas, the Program, as presently constituted and implemented, is subsidized, and the insurer (hereinafter the
``Company'') under this Arrangement shall charge rates established by the FIA; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Whereas, this Arrangement will subsidize all flood policy losses by the Company; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Whereas, this Financial Assistance/Subsidy Arrangement has been developed to involve individual Companies in
the Program, the initial step of which is to explore ways in which any interested insurer may be able to write flood insurance
under its own name; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Whereas, one of the primary objectives of the Program is to provide coverage to the maximum number of structures at
risk and because the insurance industry has marketing access through its existing facilities not directly available
to the FIA, it has been concluded that coverage will be extended to those who would not otherwise be insured under the
Program; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Whereas, flood insurance policies issued subject to this Arrangement shall be only that insurance written by the
Company in its own name pursuant to the Act; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Whereas, over time, the Program is designed to increase industry participation, and, accordingly, reduce or eliminate
Government as the principal vehicle for delivering flood insurance to the public; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Whereas, the direct beneficiaries of this Arrangement will be those Company policyholders and applicants for flood
insurance who otherwise would not be covered against the peril of flood. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Now, therefore, the parties hereto mutually undertake the following:

wishes to petition for reconsideration of the notification that it will not be reimbursed for the award or judgment
made under the above circumstances, it may do so by mailing, within thirty days of the notice declining to recognize

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
E. In the event the Act is amended, or repealed, or expires, or if the FIA is otherwise without authority to continue
the Program, financial assistance under this Arrangement may be cancelled for any new or renewal business, but the
Arrangement shall continue for policies in force which shall be allowed to run their term under the Arrangement. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
F. In the event that the Company is unable to, or otherwise fails to, carry out its obligations under this Arrangement
by reason of any order or directive duly issued by the Department of Insurance of any Jurisdiction to which the Company
is subject, the Company agrees to transfer, and the Government will accept, any and all WYO policies issued by the Company
and in force as of the date of such inability or failure to perform. In such event the Government will assume all obligations
and liabilities owed to policyholders under such policies arising before and after the date of transfer and the Company
will immediately transfer to the Government all funds in its possession with respect to all such policies transferred
and the unearned portion of the Company expenses for operating, administrative and loss adjustment on all such policies.

At the settlement of accounts the Company and the FIA shall have, and may exercise, the right to offset any balance or
balances, whether on account of premiums, commissions, losses, loss adjustment expenses, salvage, or otherwise
due one party to the other, its successors or assigns, hereunder or under any other Arrangements heretofore or hereafter
entered into between the Company and the FIA. This right of offset shall not be affected or diminished because of insolvency
of the Company. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
All debts or credits of the same class, whether liquidated or unliquidated, in favor of or against either party to this
Arrangement on the date of entry, or any order of conservation, receivership, or liquidation, shall be deemed to be
mutual debts and credits and shall be offset with the balance only to be allowed or paid. No offset shall be allowed where
a conservator, receiver, or liquidator has been appointed and where an obligation was purchased by or transferred
to a party hereunder to be used as an offset. Although a claim on the part of either party against the other may be unliquidated
or undetermined in amount on the date of the entry of the order, such claim will be regarded as being in existence as of
the date of such order and any credits or claims of the same class then in existence and held by the other party may be offset

 NMFS announces adjustments to the commercial quota for the 1994 summer flounder fishery. This action complies with
regulations implementing the Fishery Management Plan for the Summer Flounder Fishery (FMP), which require quota
overages landed in any state to be deducted from that state's quota the following year. The public is advised that a
quota adjustment has been made and is informed of the revised state quotas.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 Regulations implementing Amendment 2 to the FMP are found at 50 CFR part 625, the final rule being published on December
4, 1992 (57 FR 57358). The regulations require annual specification of a commercial quota that is apportioned among
the states from North Carolina through Maine. The process to set the annual commercial quota and the percent allocated
to each state is described in &sect;625.20. The commercial summer flounder quota for the 1994 calendar year, adopted
to ensure achievement of the appropriate fishing mortality rate of 0.53 for 1994, is set to equal 16,005,560 lb (7.3
million kg) (59 FR 10586, March 7, 1994).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 625.20(d)(2) provides that all landings for sale in a state shall be applied against that state's annual commercial
quota. Any landings in excess of the state's quota will be deducted from that state's annual quota for the following
year. Based on dealer reports and other available information, the following states were determined to have exceeded
their 1993 quotas: Maine, Massachusetts, New Jersey, Delaware, Maryland, Virginia, and North Carolina. The remaining
states of New Hampshire, Rhode Island, Connecticut, and New York did not exceed their 1993 quotas and, therefore,
no adjustments are necessary for these states. Table 1 shows the 1993 quotas adjusted for authorized transfers made
between states during the year, 1993 landings, 1993 overage amounts, 1994 quotas, and the adjusted 1994 quotas taking
into account 1993 overage amounts, by state.

 NMFS issues this final rule to implement measures 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
contained in Framework Adjustment 4 to the Northeast Multispecies 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Fishery Management Plan (FMP). The measures contained in this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
rule are a series of time and area closures for sink gillnet gear 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to reduce bycatch of harbor porpoise. These measures replace 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
blocks of time during each month during which all sink gillnets 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
would be required to be removed from the water. The intent of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
this rule is to reduce significantly the bycatch of harbor 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
porpoise in the Gulf of Maine sink gillnet fishery.

Background 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The New England Fishery Management Council (Council) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
submitted Amendment 5 to NMFS on September 27, 1993. One of its 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
principal objectives was to reduce the bycatch of harbor porpoise 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in the Gulf of Maine sink gillnet fishery by the end of year 4 of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
implementation of the Amendment to a level not to exceed 2 percent 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of the population, based on the best estimates of abundance and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
bycatch. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Council was requested by NMFS in October 1992 to take 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
action to reduce the harbor porpoise bycatch within the context of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Amendment 5. The Council agreed to develop fishery management 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
measures that would address the issue on the basis that the sink 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
gillnet fishery was subject to regulation under the FMP, there 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
were no existing regulatory mechanisms to reduce porpoise takes, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and the current level of bycatch in the fishery was not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
sustainable. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Additionally, on January 7, 1993, NMFS published a proposed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
rule (58 FR 3108) to list the Gulf of Maine population of harbor 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
porpoise as threatened under the Endangered Species Act (ESA), due 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
primarily to the level of incidental takes in the sink gillnet 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
fishery and the lack of an adequate regulatory mechanism to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
accomplish bycatch reductions. As NMFS noted in the rule, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Marine Mammal Exemption Program contained in the 1988 amendments 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to the Marine Mammal Protection Act (MMPA) did not set bycatch 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
limits. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Council subsequently adopted the goal of achieving 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reductions in harbor porpoise bycatch, so that the actual amount 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of harbor porpoise caught as bycatch in the sink gillnet fishery 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
would not exceed 2 percent of the estimates of the harbor porpoise 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
population, in part to avoid the pending ESA listing. This 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
objective was based on a recruitment rate for harbor porpoise that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
is about 4 percent per year, and a conservative fisheries bycatch 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
level that should not exceed 50 percent of the recruitment rate 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for marine mammals. The 1991/1992 pooled harbor porpoise 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
population abundance estimate is 47,200. Using the lower bound of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the 95-percent confidence interval for that estimate, 39,500, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1990, 1991, and 1992 ratios of bycatch to average population 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
abundance were approximately 6 percent, 4.3 percent and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2.2 percent, respectively. A 2-percent goal allocated solely to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the Gulf of Maine sink gillnet fishery did not take into account 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the unknown level of harbor porpoise takes in the Mid-Atlantic 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
region and in adjacent Canadian waters. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Because the 1992 abundance and bycatch information was not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
available until June 1993, however, development of effective 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
measures based on the best scientific information lagged behind 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the formulation of the overall Amendment 5 package. The harbor 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
porpoise bycatch mitigation measure implemented by the final rule 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for the Amendment required the removal of all sink gillnets from 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the water during 4-day blocks of time each month in year 1 after 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
implementation of Amendment 5. Years 2 and 3 of Amendment 5 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
called for 8-day blocks each month. Year 4 required 12-day blocks 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and year 5 required 16-day blocks. The Council supported, and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
NMFS approved, the use of blocks of time as an interim measure on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the assumption that appropriate time and area management measures 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
would be developed as soon as possible. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The rationale for the interim measure was based largely on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the lack of information concerning the sink gillnet fishery. By 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
``masking'' periods of time monthly, during which all sink gillnets 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
must be removed from the water, the time during which harbor 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
porpoise would be exposed to that gear would be reduced. In a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
simulation analyzing the effect of closing the Gulf of Maine sink 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
gillnet fishery for 4 consecutive random days per month, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
approximately 8.5 percent of the fish would not be landed and 9.3 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
percent of the harbor porpoise bycatch would be avoided. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
effect of choosing random days, however, produced very different 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
values of harbor porpoise bycatch for the different trials. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Because of the imprecise nature of the impacts of the blocks 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of time, and upon receipt of the NMFS Northeast Fisheries Science 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Center's (NEFSC) comprehensive spatial and temporal analysis of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the bycatch in the fall of 1993, the Council voted to support the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
development of a time and area closure management system. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
intent was to replace the existing gillnet alternative (nets 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
removed from the water for specified blocks of time) as the harbor 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
porpoise bycatch mitigation measure. The Council decided, and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
NMFS agreed, that the gillnet fleet would not be subject to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
groundfish effort reductions until the effect of the harbor 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
porpoise bycatch reduction measures could be evaluated for their 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
impacts on groundfish fishing effort (approximately 1 year after 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
implementation of Amendment 5). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
NMFS is amending the regulations under the framework 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
abbreviated rulemaking procedure established by Amendment 5 and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
codified at 50 CFR part 651, subpart C. This procedure requires 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the Council, when making specifically allowed adjustments to the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FMP, to develop and analyze the actions over the span of at least 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
two Council meetings. The Council must provide the public with 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
advance notice of both the proposals and the analysis, and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
opportunity to comment on them prior to and at the second Council 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
meeting. Upon review of the analysis and public comment, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Council may recommend to the Regional Director of NMFS that the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
measures be published as a final rule if certain conditions are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
met. The Director, Northeast Region, NMFS, (Regional Director) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
may publish the measures as a final rule or as a proposed rule if 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
additional public comment is needed. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Council complied with the procedural requirements and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
submitted the rule to NMFS, and NMFS concurs with the provisions 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of the Council's submission. This final rule implements time and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
area closures based on an analysis by the NEFSC of harbor porpoise 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
bycatch using NMFS weighout and observer program data on the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
distribution of sink gillnet activity and the seasonal and spatial 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
distribution of harbor porpoise in the Gulf of Maine. Extensive 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
discussions among the Council, the fishing industry and scientists 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
led to the measures outlined below. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For purposes of the management measures contained in this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
final rule for Framework Adjustment 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=6 f=1 -->
#
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
4, the Gulf of Maine is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
divided into three areas: The Northeast (from Penobscot Bay to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Eastport, ME); Mid-coast (from Cape Ann to Penobscot Bay); and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Massachusetts Bay (from Cape Cod to Cape Ann). The Council 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
recommended 30-day closures for each of these areas. The timing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of the closures corresponds to periods when harbor porpoise 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
bycatch is most likely to occur. The duration accounts for the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
variability of harbor porpoise movements. The Council recognizes 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that the Mid-coast and Northeast areas account for more of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
bycatch than Massachusetts Bay. At this time, however, harbor 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
porpoise bycatch mitigation measures are being applied uniformly 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
across all regions in the Gulf of Maine. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The NEFSC estimated that reductions of 20 to 40 percent might 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
be realized in the first year of implementation of Framework 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Adjustment 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=6 f=1 -->
#
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
4 if boundaries discussed in its initial analysis of a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
time and area management system for the Gulf of Maine were used in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
conjunction with the proposed 30-day closures. The Council's 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
boundary modifications could alter that estimate to some unknown 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
degree because of the potential displacement of gillnet fishing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
effort to areas where harbor porpoise are still subject to some 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
level of bycatch. It is reasonable, however, to anticipate the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
minimum estimate of approximately 20 percent, given that the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
timing of the closures occurs in seasons of highest bycatch of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
harbor porpoise in their respective areas. It is also reasonable 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to conclude that the continued annual target reductions may be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
accomplished by modifications to the same measures. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Council adopted the approach of integrating effort 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reductions for key species of groundfish stocks with harbor 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
porpoise bycatch mitigation measures after the first year of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
program implementation. If the measures, or any future approach 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that is adopted, accomplish the harbor porpoise objective without 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reducing gillnet fishing effort sufficiently to reach the 50 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
percent effort reduction target, the Council will impose 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
additional fishing restrictions.

There is a band outside the Mid-coast closure area that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
encompasses Jeffreys Ledge and is described relative to the Mid-
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
coast area as east on 42
<!-- PJG 0017 degreeslatlong -->
&cir;30 N. from the shore to 70
<!-- PJG 0017 degreeslatlong -->
&cir;00 W., north 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
along 70
<!-- PJG 0017 degreeslatlong -->
&cir;00 W. to 43
<!-- PJG 0017 degreeslatlong -->
&cir;00 N., on 43
<!-- PJG 0017 degreeslatlong -->
&cir;00 N. to 69
<!-- PJG 0017 degreeslatlong -->
&cir;00 W., then north on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
69
<!-- PJG 0017 degreeslatlong -->
&cir;00 W. to the shore. According to the sea sampling data base, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
harbor porpoise bycatch in this band has been relatively high 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
during the last 3 years. Concerns focus on whether a displacement 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of more fishing effort into this region might account for a kill 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
rate as high as or potentially higher than in previous years. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under provisions of this final rule, the band will remain open, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
but the Council recommended mandatory observer coverage for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
vessels fishing in the area if funds are available. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Areas shown on Figure 4 to part 651, but not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
enclosed by the boundary lines described above, would not be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
subject to closure at this time. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Council program calls for a 20-percent reduction in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Gulf of Maine harbor porpoise bycatch in year 1 of implementation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of Amendment 5. To ensure continued efforts to reduce the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
bycatch, Amendment 5 states that a Harbor Porpoise Review Team 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(HPRT), appointed by the Council, will evaluate the effectiveness 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of the Council's mitigation measures annually by September 15 of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
each year and, if necessary, recommend changes to ensure that the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
bycatch reduction goals are met. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Future management measures will be designed to achieve a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
60-percent reduction in the bycatch of harbor porpoise from 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
current levels over a 3-year period. Based on a bycatch of 1,300 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
animals (a figure that constitutes a rough average of the bycatch 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
estimates over the last 2 years), the bycatch in years 1, 2, and 3 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
would be reduced to 1,040, 780, and 520 animals, respectively. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Such a reduction schedule might surpass the goal of reducing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the harbor porpoise bycatch to a level not to exceed 2 percent of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the estimates of population abundance and bycatch (39,500 and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
approximately 1,300, respectively). The use of the lower bound of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the 95-percent confidence interval for the abundance estimate, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
39,500, adds a level of conservatism that in part addresses the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
problem of the confidence intervals surrounding the bycatch 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
estimates. As previously discussed, the entire 2 percent bycatch 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
cannot be allocated solely to the Gulf of Maine sink gillnet 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
fleet. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A specific target for year 4 will be established by the HPRT 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
after consideration of previous targets not met in any given year 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
or because of possible increased bycatch reductions required by 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the 1994 amendments to the Marine Mammal Protection Act. For 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
example, if the 20 percent target is missed in any of the first 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
three years, the fourth year allows the flexibility to add that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
portion of the target reductions not achieved in any of the first 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
three years to be deferred until the next year or until year four 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of the program. The year-4 target, however, cannot exceed 20 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
percent of the total reduction required over the entire 4-year 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
period.

The Council held the first of two meetings required under the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Amendment 5 framework adjustment process on February 17, 1994. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Two public hearings were subsequently held on March 9, 1994, in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Portsmouth, NH, and on March 10, 1994, in Ellsworth, ME. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Council approved the closures for the Northeast and Mid-coast 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
areas at the second Council meeting held on March 17, 1994. On 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
April 6, 1994, the Council adopted boundaries and a 30-day closure 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
period for the Massachusetts Bay area. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition to the meetings held within the formal framework 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
period, the public was notified of all Marine Mammal Committee 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
meetings held between September 1993 and March 1994, for the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
purpose of developing the time and area closure plan. For scoping 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
purposes, the issue also was included in the Amendment 5 public 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
hearing document and was reviewed at a series of coastwide 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
meetings held in the spring of 1993. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

4 are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
based on the best scientific information available. NMFS has 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
conducted two population surveys of harbor porpoise abundance in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the Gulf of Maine/Bay of Fundy region. Additionally, bycatch 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
estimates have been calculated from observed gillnet trips, based 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
on sea sampling data collected since 1989. Since June 1991, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
observers have made trips on roughly 9 percent of the Gulf of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Maine gillnet trips. All available information on the biology, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
seasonal distribution, abundance and bycatch was reviewed at two 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
international workshops convened by the NEFSC in Woods Hole, MA in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
May 1992 and February 1994.

Comment: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Several commenters expressed concern over the harbor 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
porpoise abundance estimates for the Gulf of Maine/Bay of Fundy 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
population and the disparity between the point estimates for 1991 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and 1992. They urged the Council to ask NMFS to conduct ongoing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
surveys in order to better refine the data. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Again, the estimates are based on the best 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
scientific information available. NMFS abundance estimates for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1991 and 1992 are 37,500 (% coefficient of variation (CV)=28.8, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
95% confidence interval (CI)=26,700 to 86,400) and 67,500 (%CV=23.1, 95% CI=32,900 to 104,600), respectively.
The reason for the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
nearly twofold, but statistically insignificant, increase between 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1991 and 1992 is unknown. Although the increase is statistically 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
insignificant, it may reflect a real change in abundance due to a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
distribution change or methodological sampling error. Methods to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
investigate this difference were recommended at the February 23&hyph;25 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
NEFSC workshop to evaluate the status of harbor porpoise in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
western North Atlantic. An abundance survey has been recommended 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for 1995. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

Comment:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A suggestion was made to divide the Northeast 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
closure area in half, longitudinally, or simply to make the entire 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
area smaller. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Northeast area proposed for closure from August 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
15 through September 13 already represents a compromise forged 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
between fishermen and the Council. But concerns still exist that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
animals will move into adjacent areas where vessels may 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
concentrate and increase the likelihood of takes, rather than 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reduce that possibility. Also, NMFS survey data indicate that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
harbor porpoise usually frequent the same general areas of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Gulf of Maine, but not always at the same time every year. Because 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of this variability, shorter closures in smaller areas could 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
result in little or no reduction in bycatch, if animals are not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
present during the closure period. This would result in lost 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
fishing time with no benefit. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

Comment: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Commenters expressed concern about Northeast time 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and area closures that would eliminate fishing in the Schoodic 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Ridge area, a region vital to the ``downeast'' fishermen. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Council's final decision took into account the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
fact that the time and area plan would be phased in over 4 years. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
During the first year of implementation, the Schoodic Ridge 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
fishing grounds will be left open. Further changes to the area 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
will be based on the harbor porpoise bycatch estimates derived 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
from sea sampling program and other relevant data submitted to the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Council.

Comment: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Commenters from Maine questioned why Jeffreys Ledge, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
an area located off the coasts of Massachusetts and New Hampshire 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that accounts for a relatively high level of bycatch, was being 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
left open in the first year of the plan. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Council's Mid-coast closure area incorporates 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
an area known as Jeffreys Basin, but excludes Jeffreys Ledge. In 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
past years, the basin area has represented a higher level of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
bycatch than Jeffreys Ledge. Concerns focus on whether the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
displacement of more fishing effort onto Jeffreys Ledge might 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
account for a kill rate as high as or potentially higher than, in

previous years. As with the Northeast area, however, the Council 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
considered the boundaries adequate for year one of implementation

One individual asked for an exemption for small-boat 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
operators who fish inshore only, and who are responsible for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
little or no harbor porpoise bycatch. Otherwise, they would 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
effectively be excluded from the fishery as of the November 1&hyph;30 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Mid-coast closure because they are too small to fish in offshore 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
conditions. Another commenter suggested that these vessels fish 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
under the 500-pound (226.8 kg) possession limit for regulated 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
species of groundfish.

Harbor porpoise throughout the Gulf of Maine are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
distributed both inshore and offshore and become entangled in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
gillnets, regardless of vessel size. Additionally, all sink 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
gillnet vessels fishing under a Federal multispecies permit, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
regardless of where they are fishing, are subject to the porpoise 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
bycatch reduction measures.

Gillnet gear should be given credit, one commenter

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Once the time and area program has been in place 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(approximately 1 year from the date of implementation), the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Council will evaluate the impact of the gillnet fishery on the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
mortality of groundfish stocks and develop management measures 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that are appropriate for the gillnet sector.

Comment:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Some commenters felt the harbor porpoise bycatch 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reduction program was a mechanism being used by other interests to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
close the sink gillnet fishery. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Council's measures are designed to minimize 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
impacts on the sink gillnet fishery, while at the same time 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
achieve the stated harbor porpoise bycatch reduction objectives. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Council has held 16 public meetings since its initial 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
commitment to incorporate bycatch measures in Amendment 5 and has 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
involved the fishing community, conservation groups and interested 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
parties in the development of the FMP.

Several commenters felt it was inappropriate to use 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the harbor porpoise time and area closure plan to protect 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
endangered whales.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As part of the Council's obligations under section 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
7 of the ESA, a consultation with NMFS is required if a fishery 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
affects, either directly or indirectly, endangered or threatened 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
species or any designated critical habitat. Because this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
framework adjustment represents a change in management measures 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for a gear type that has interactions with endangered species, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Council re-initiated the section 7 consultation developed for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Amendment 5, identified potential interactions and has addressed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
them in the context of this framework adjustment.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Many fishermen supported the use of ``pingers,'' sound 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
emitting devices that increase an animal's awareness of nets, as a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
bycatch mitigation measure. A suggestion was made to use pingers 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in year 1 of implementation of Amendment 5 in conjunction with 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
four-day blocks of time, but with no subsequent expansion of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
days during which nets would be removed from the water in future 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
years.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The 4-day blocks of time during which all gillnets 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
would be removed from the water each month throughout the range of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
species covered by the Northeast Multispecies FMP was almost 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
universally rejected by commenters who attended public meetings 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and by those who submitted written comments. The Council and NMFS 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
are aware that initiatives are underway which involve acoustical 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
alarm research and possible modifications to gillnet gear to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reduce porpoise bycatch. If any of these approaches produce 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
scientifically supportable results that can be incorporated into a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
management strategy, the Council would recommend them through a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
framework adjustment with a minimum of regulatory delay.

Comment: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Several commenters questioned why the Council 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
rejected the use of an industry proposal based on a reduction in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the number of gillnets in use. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
At this time, it is not possible to determine the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
relationship between the number of nets and fishing or harbor 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
porpoise mortality. It is known only that there is a relationship 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that is not linear. Even a simple estimation of the number of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
nets in use is impossible, at present, because of the variability 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of length of nets, numbers of nets in a string, soak time and the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
variable numbers of both full- and part-time vessels participating 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in the fishery. Moreover, enforcement of a reduction in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
number of nets in the ocean, as opposed to a time and area 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
prohibition, would be very difficult, if not impossible, to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
accomplish at this time.

This regulation is not subject to the requirements to prepare 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a proposed rule under the conditions met by this framework action 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that have provided adequate prior public comment when the action 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
was proposed and discussed over the course of several Council 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
meetings. Therefore, a regulatory flexibility analysis was not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
prepared for this action because it is exempt from such an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
analysis under the Regulatory Flexibility Act. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This final rule has been determined to be not significant for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
purposes of E.O. 12866. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Assistant Administrator for Fisheries, NOAA (AA) finds 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
there is good cause to waive prior notice under 5 U.S.C. 553(b) of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the Administrative Procedure Act (APA). Public meetings held by 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the Council to discuss the management measures implemented by this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
rule provided adequate opportunity for public comment to be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
considered. Thus, additional opportunity for public comment is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
unnecessary. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The AA also finds that under section 553(d)(1) of the APA, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
because immediate implementation of this rule relieves a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
restriction that would require 4 days out of the water by all 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
vessels using sink gillnet gear in May and June, there is no need 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to delay for 30 days the effectiveness of this regulation.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The FMP was prepared by the Western Pacific Fishery Management Council (Council) and approved and implemented by
the Secretary of Commerce (Secretary) at a time when there were few problems in the domestic fisheries for management
unit species (billfish and associated species) and the Hawaii longline fishery consisted of less than 40 relatively
small vessels fishing primarily near the Hawaiian Islands. Conditions are now very different. The longline fishery
based in Hawaii now consists of 167 vessels up to 101 ft (30.8 m) in length and targets swordfish, tuna, and other management
unit species. Vessels often travel up to 2,000 miles (3,219 km) from port. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Due to the rapid growth of this fishery, concern was raised about the potential and actual impact of the expanded fishery
on the status of some fish stocks, the impact of increased longline catches on other fisheries, and interactions between
longline fishing and protected species such as Hawaiian monk seals and sea turtles. This led to establishment in April
1991 of a 3-year moratorium on new entry to the Hawaii longline fishery. Amendment 7 to the FMP establishes a new limited
entry program for the Hawaii-based longline fishery. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The limited entry program requires permits that will be freely transferable. Permit owners may upgrade their vessels
or transfer their permits for registration with other vessels provided the newly designated vessel is no longer than
101 ft (30.8 m) in length as measured in accordance with the rule. Initial permit issuance decisions are made by the
Fisheries Management Division, Southwest Region, NMFS. The program includes provision for appeals of permit decisions
to the Regional Director, Southwest Region, NMFS (Regional Director). The rule includes broad framework procedures
for subsequent adjustment of the conservation and management measures for the pelagics fisheries to provide for
more efficient administration of the fisheries. Three species of fish are added to the management unit. The rule also
makes several technical changes to the regulations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A proposed rule to implement Amendment 7 to the FMP was published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 on February 24, 1994 (59 FR 9050). The proposed rule (1) described in detail the concerns being addressed by the Council
and actions taken by the Council and Secretary to address those concerns, (2) summarized the measures proposed in
Amendment 7 and the objectives of the amendment, and (3) indicated the reasons for other regulatory changes proposed.
Those discussions will not be repeated here. After consideration of public comment on the Amendment and the proposed
rule, Amendment 7 was approved; this final rule implements that amendment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This rule is consistent with the Administrative Procedure Act (5 U.S.C. 553), which requires that final rules be published
not less than 30 days before they become effective. In the period between publication of the final rule and the effective
date, NMFS will advise moratorium permit holders of the need to submit applications and supporting information in
a timely manner so that new limited entry permits can be issued by the effective date of this rule.

Comments and Responses 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Comments were received from, or on behalf of, 46 fishery participants, workers in support industries, and other interested
parties. Most (40) favored approval of the amendment and the proposed rule. Four commenters recommended disapproval
or partial disapproval of the amendment. Two commenters submitted technical comments concerning the language of
the permit eligibility criteria. In the proposed rule, NMFS specifically invited comment on the adequacy of the proposed
rule and complementary actions taken by the Council and NMFS to ensure that the take of sea turtles in the longline fishery
would not be excessive. One set of comments was received in response. Summaries of comments and NMFS responses are
provided below.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Comments 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(1): Comments favoring the amendment were received from 40 people. Most of these were on petitions from workers in
the longline fishery or support industries. The signers supported Amendment 7 because they felt it would provide
stability, promote conservation, and provide vessel owners with flexibility needed to make sound business decisions.
In addition, separate letters were received from seven permit holders supporting the amendment. They felt it would
prevent overfishing and adverse impacts on other fisheries, would provide needed flexibility to vessel owners to
make business decisions, and would maintain substantial economic benefits to the fishery participants and support
industries. All commenters supporting the Amendment noted that existing area closures would be retained so that
there should be no adverse effects on other fisheries.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(1): None needed, Amendment 7 has been approved and is being implemented by this final rule.

Comment 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(2): One individual (an owner of several of the larger longline vessels with permits) recommended that the amendment
be disapproved because the fishery is already showing signs of economic difficulty, with longer trips, smaller fish,
and less profit. In the commenter's view, allowing further vessel upgrades would exacerbate the economic difficulties.
The amendment also was criticized for allowing upgrading of smaller vessels while prohibiting upgrading of larger
vessels.

Response 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(2): The available data do not indicate any economic or biological problems in the fishery. The amendment indicates
that the average sizes of most species of fish landed have held relatively steady since 1987, and the average size of
swordfish has increased since 1987. Aside from this commenter, no other participants in the fishery have indicated
that their catches or profits have declined, except for fishermen who were effectively precluded from fishing traditional
grounds by the area closures imposed around the main Hawaiian Islands. There is no indication that catch rates have
decreased due to excessive fishing pressure. The Council and NMFS acknowledge that the expanded longline fishery
has been operating for only a few years and that many interested parties have expressed concern about possible long-term
impacts on the stocks or other fisheries and protected species. Therefore, the Council has proposed an approach to
allow a limited increase in the fishery with greater flexibility for fishermen to make business decisions. Controlled
expansion of the fishery will provide a basis for determining whether the expanded fishery is affecting fish stocks
or fishery participants and whether corrective action is needed. If information later indicates problems, the amendment
includes framework procedures to address those problems. Allowing upgrading of smaller vessels is intended to provide
a fair competitive opportunity within the longline fishery for owners of small vessels that were effectively precluded
from fishing when the longline area closures went into effect. It is not expected that all participants will acquire
larger vessels to the maximum size permitted, though some shift to larger vessels is expected. Finally, disapproval
of the amendment would result in no limit on participation. No change was made to the rule in response to these comments.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(3): One environmental conservation organization commented in opposition to the amendment. This organization
indicated the moratorium on new entry should be continued until data are available from the longline observer program
and other sources to assess impacts on sea turtles and the status of fish stocks harvested by the longline fishery.
This organization felt that the allowable incidental take of sea turtles is excessive and was concerned that the amendment
would result in additional effort and thus a risk of higher turtle takes and jeopardy to turtle stocks. The commenter
also was critical of the low level of coverage achieved in the voluntary program.

Response 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(3): The moratorium terminated at 12 midnight on April 22, 1994. If the amendment had been disapproved, there would
no longer have been any limitation on the number or size of longline vessels in the fishery. The moratorium may not be
continued unless the Secretary rejects the amendment and issues regulations under the Secretary's amendment authority.
In the Secretary's view, the framework procedures of Amendment 7 allow relatively quick action to adjust management
measures if needed to protect sea turtles or fish stocks. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A mandatory observer program was established by an interim final rule published on December 22, 1993 (58 FR 67699).
By April 10, 1994, 14 completed trips had been observed. This represents a significant increase in observer coverage
over the voluntary program. Consultations under section 7 of the Endangered Species Act (ESA) have been reinitiated
and will consider data from the voluntary and mandatory observer programs, and information on the status and trends
of turtle populations, to determine whether new conservation recommendations or reasonable and prudent measures
should be applied in this fishery. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
With respect to the impacts of the fishery on fish stocks, the available data indicate that no stocks have been affected
by the longline fishery to date. No changes have been made in the regulations in response to these comments.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(4): Two other commenters recommended partial disapproval of the amendment. Both favored limited entry for the longline
fishery, but also favored limiting harvesting capacity of the fleet by only allowing vessel upgrades for safety,
and not providing permits to those who did not fish in the moratorium. One emphasized the incomplete and dated nature
of much of the data used and criticized the management system and fishery for the waste of sharks, noting that only a
very small portion of the shark catch is retained; this commenter also suggested a quota system could be developed.
The other commenter proposed that, if vessel upgrades are allowed, gear upgrades should be limited. A harvesting
capacity quota approach should be developed in a three-tier (small, medium, and large) vessel system. This commenter
feared that longliners could decimate stocks and then move to new areas, leaving local fishermen to pay the price.
Both commenters also suggested that some Council members who worked on the amendment had financial conflicts of interest.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(4): Many elements of the amendment already comport with the commenters' recommendations; for example, the maximum
number of permits may be no more than the number in the moratorium, and permits will not be issued to persons who did not
fish (excluding small vessels and persons who obtained longline permits due to linkage with lobster permits) during
the moratorium. However, the Council chose to allow more flexibility for vessel upgrades to equalize the opportunity
for all vessel owners to compete in the fishery. The best scientific information available has been used. The Council
and NMFS acknowledged the limitations of the data. The amendment includes framework procedures so management adjustments
can be made rapidly if the data indicate a need for changes. The Council chose not to recommend a quota system, given
the inadequacy of data to determine allowable catch and allocations to different fishermen. The Council considered
gear limitations but recognized the serious difficulty in enforcing such limitations due to limited at-sea enforcement
resources. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Issues of discards and bycatch have been raised to the Council, and the Council will review the data collected under
the mandatory observer program to determine how to address these issues in the future. The Council considered establishment
of a harvesting capacity management system and concluded that a fair and effective system would require much additional
data collection and analysis. The Council agreed to continue work on alternate means to control effort and capacity
for implementation through the framework procedures in the amendment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Regarding conflict of interest, the Magnuson Fishery Conservation and Management Act (Magnuson Act) permits Council
members with financial interests in harvesting, marketing, or processing activities to vote on matters that affect
those interests, if disclosed publicly in accordance with regulations governing Regional Fishery Management Councils
at 50 CFR part 601. No changes were made in the regulations in response to these comments.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (6): The Council indicated that the language of the permit eligibility criteria concerning the linkage between longline
permits and northwestern Hawaiian Islands (NWHI) lobster limited entry permits needed revision to be consistent
with the intent of the Council. That is, the criteria in the proposed rule would not have afforded eligibility for a
Hawaii longline limited entry permit to someone who, at the end of the moratorium, was the last holder of record of a
moratorium longline limited entry permit and held a northwest Hawaiian Islands (NWHI) lobster limited entry permit,
both of which were obtained from another party. It was the Council's intent that a person who obtained both permits
from another party would thus be eligible for a Hawaii longline limited entry permit based on ``the lobster fishery
criterion'' referred to in Amendment 7.

 (6): A new paragraph &sect;685.9(b)(2)(iv) has been added to be consistent with the Council's intent. It is estimated
that five longline permit holders will be affected by this change by qualifying for new permits under these criteria.

Changes from the Proposed Rule 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
An item inadvertently not discussed in the proposed rule is that initial permit decisions are made by the Chief, Fisheries
Management Division, Southwest Region, NMFS. This final rule includes a provision for appeals of permit decisions
to the Regional Director. Experience in the moratorium program indicates a need for an appeal process to review decisions
that applicants believe are incorrect or based on faulty interpretation of facts. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The definition of ``length overall'' of a vessel has been revised to mean only the horizontal distance between the
foremost part of the stem and the aftermost part of the stern. The length overall does not include fittings or attachments
that extend beyond these two points, including bowsprits, rudders, or outboard motor brackets. References in the
proposed definition to other vessel length measurements appearing in U.S. Coast Guard or state vessel registration
documents have been removed because they could have resulted in the use of different vessel length measurement systems.
As revised, the definition provides a consistent and uniform method of determining vessel length for all vessels
participating in the fishery; it is the same method of length measurement used in many other federally regulated fisheries.
Under this definition, the longest vessel active in the fishery in the moratorium is 101 feet (30.8 m) rather than 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
93 feet (28 meters), as described in the preamble to the proposed rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The eligibility criteria for issuance of a Hawaii limited entry permit in &sect;685.9(b)(2) were modified. As noted
in response to comment Number 6 the linkage between longline permits and NWHI lobster limited entry permits was modified
to be consistent with Council intent. Also, several moratorium permits were invalidated due to the sinking or destruction
of vessels. The holders of these permits had been active during the moratorium period and therefore would qualify
for permits under the new program. By focussing on the last holder of record of limited entry permits issued under the
moratorium, the final rule provides that these individuals will qualify for new permits, consistent with the intent
of Amendment 7. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A prohibition (&sect;685.9(a)(4)) was added to require that necessary permits be on board vessels and available
for inspection by an authorized agent unless the vessel was at sea when the permit was issued, in which case the permit
must be on board the vessel on the next trip. The requirement for the permit to be on board the vessel was in effect during
the moratorium, but was inadvertently omitted from the proposed rule.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A deadline for applications for initial Hawaii longline limited entry permits has been set in &sect;685.9(c) to ensure
that the number of permits will be limited after a given period of time. Applications must be submitted within 120 days
after the date of publication in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. The Council will be considering changes in allowable participation and effort in the future and needs to know the
size of the permitted fleet in order to evaluate the benefits and costs of changes in regulations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A change was made to the observer program (&sect;685.11) to refer to Hawaii longline limited entry permit requirements
(&sect;685.9(a)(2)), so that the notification requirements of &sect;685.11 will apply to owners of vessels with
such permits.

This final rule has been determined to be not significant for purposes of E.O. 12866. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Council prepared a combined final FMP amendment/Final Environmental Impact Statement (EIS)/Regulatory Flexibility
Analysis (RFA) covering the impacts of the fishery as managed under this amendment and alternative approaches. The
final FMP amendment/final EIS satisfies National Environmental Policy Act requirements for documentation and
analysis of the impacts of the fishery on the environment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A consultation under section 7 of the Endangered Species Act (ESA) was conducted and NMFS issued a Biological Opinion
(Opinion) and Incidental Take Statement (Statement) in June 1993 concerning the take of sea turtles in the longline
fishery. Consultations have been reinitiated and a new Biological Opinion is being prepared. A new consultation
to address Amendment 7 is not necessary. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This rule is expected to have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. Hawaii longline
vessel owners (approximately 167) will have more flexibility to buy and sell vessels and permits and to upgrade their
fishing vessels to compete more effectively in the domestic longline fishery, as well as with foreign fleets. It is
estimated that total revenue from longline landings will increase to $60 million per year from about $45 million in
1992. The final amendment/FEIS includes an RFA that is adopted as final without change. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This rule includes a change in an information collection previously approved by the Office of Management and Budget
(OMB No. 0648&hyph;0204). The change is included in a request submitted by the Southwest Region, NMFS, for approval
of modification and extension of the current collection that covers all Southwest Region fishery permit programs.
The change requires prospective participants in the Hawaii longline fishery to submit permit application forms
and supporting information, including a current Certificate of Documentation from the U.S. Coast Guard, to obtain
or transfer a permit under the new limited entry program. Landings records from the existing Hawaii longline logbook
reporting requirement will be used to determine whether an individual has met the landings requirement to qualify
for a permit. The estimated burden on the applicants is 30 minutes per application. This is less than the average of
1 hour or more that had been required for applications for permits in the moratorium period, because the moratorium
applications required documentation of intent to enter the longline fishery at a time when investment decisions
were made. The documentation requirements under the new permit program will be simpler. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This rule also restates requirements for the submission of logbooks and post-landing notifications. These requirements
have already been approved by OMB under Control Number 0648&hyph;0214. The response times for these requirements
were estimated to be 5 minutes per day for the logbook and 5 minutes per notification. Send comments regarding these
burden estimates or any other aspect of these collection-of-information requirements, including suggestions
for reducing burden, to the Director of the Southwest Region, NMFS, and to OMB (see

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
New management measures may be added, through rulemaking, if new information demonstrates that there are biological,
social, or economic concerns in the fishery. The following framework process allows for measures that may affect
operation of the fisheries, gear restrictions, quotas, or reductions or increases in longline catch and/or effort,
if the information supports such a change. Additional information may indicate the need for new management measures
for other sectors of the fishery, such as harvest guidelines, permits for certain classes of vessels, or reporting
requirements.

Assessment of the fisheries. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
By June 30 of each year, the Council-appointed Pelagics Plan Team will prepare an annual report on fisheries in the
fishery management area, containing the following: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) Fishery performance data (e.g., landings, effort, value of landings, species composition); 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) Summary of recent research and survey results; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) Habitat conditions and recent alterations; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iv) Enforcement activities and problems; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(v) Administrative action (e.g., data collection and reporting, permits); 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(vi) State and territorial management actions; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(vii) Assessment of need for Council action (including biological, economic, social, enforcement, administrative,
and state/Federal needs, problems, and trends). Indications of potential problems warranting further investigation
may be signaled by indicator criteria. These criteria could include, but are not limited to, important changes in:
Mean size of the catch of any species; estimated ratio of fishing mortality to natural mortality for any species; decline
in catch per unit effort by any sector; ex-vessel revenue of any sector; relative proportions of gear in and around
the EEZ; rate of entry/exit of fishermen in the fisheries; revenues for a significant percentage of any sector; total
pelagic landings; species composition of the pelagic landings; research results; habitat or environmental conditions;
or level of interactions between pelagic fishing operations and protected species in the EEZ or surrounding waters;

The annual report shall specify any recommendations made by the Pelagics Plan Team to the Council. Recommendations
may cover actions suggested for Federal regulations, state/territorial action, enforcement or administrative
elements, and research and data collection. Recommendations will include an assessment of urgency and the effects
of not taking action and will indicate whether changes involve existing measures, which may be changed under paragraph
(c) of this section, or new measures, which may be implemented under paragraph (d) of this section.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Procedure for changing established measures.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (1) Established measures are those that are or have been in place via rulemaking procedures for various sectors of
the fisheries, including, but not limited to, requirements governing: Longline general permits; Hawaii longline
limited entry permits; longline logbooks and other reporting requirements; longline area closures; and longline
gear marking requirements. The estimated and potential impacts of these measures have been evaluated in past Fishery
Management Plan amendments and associated documents. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) The Council will identify problems that may warrant action through the annual report described in paragraph (b)(1)
of this section, or a separate report from the Pelagics Plan Team, the Advisory Subpanel, Pelagics Review Board, Scientific
and Statistical Committee, pelagic fishery sector, enforcement officials, NMFS, or other sources. Identified
problems will be addressed as follows: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) At a Council Meeting following completion or receipt of a report identifying a problem, the Council will discuss
whether changes to established conservation and management measures would resolve the problem. Notice to the public
and news media preceding the meeting will indicate that the Council intends to discuss and possibly recommend regulatory
adjustments through the framework process for established measures to address the issue or problem. The notice must
summarize the issue(s) and the basis for recommending the measures being reviewed and would refer interested parties
to the document(s) pertaining to the issue.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(ii) Based on discussions at the meeting, which could include participation by the Pelagics Plan Team, Advisory Subpanel,
Pelagics Review Board, Scientific and Statistical Committee, or other Council organizations, the Council will
decide whether to recommend action by the Regional Director. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) The Regional Director will be asked to indicate any special concerns or objections to the possible actions being
considered under the framework process and, if there are any concerns or objections, will be asked for ways to resolve
them. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) If the Council decides to proceed, a document will be prepared describing the problem and the proposed regulatory
adjustment to resolve it. The document will demonstrate how the adjustment is consistent with the purposes of the
established measure and that the impacts had been addressed in the document supporting the original imposition of
the measure. The document will be submitted to the Regional Director with a recommendation for action. The Council
may indicate its intent that the recommendations are to be approved or disapproved as a single action. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) If the Regional Director approves part or all of the Council's recommendation, the Secretary, in accordance with
the Administrative Procedure Act, may implement the approved change in an established measure by publishing a final
rule, waiving advance notice and comment. This does not preclude the Secretary from deciding to provide additional
opportunity for advance notice and comment, but contemplates that the Council process will satisfy the requirements
of the Magnuson Act and Administrative Procedure Act regarding prior notice and comment. Established measures are
measures that have been evaluated and applied in the past, and adjustments under this framework must be consistent
with the original intent of the measure and within the scope of analysis in previous documents supporting the existing
measure. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5) Nothing in this section limits the authority of the Secretary to take emergency action under section 305(c) of
the Magnuson Act. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(d) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Procedure for implementing new measures
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. (1) New measures are those that have not been used before or measures that, while previously applied, would be applied
to another fishing sector (e.g., non-longline pelagic fishery) or gear type for the first time. New measures may have
been previously considered in a past FMP amendment or document, but the specific impacts on the persons to whom the
measures would newly apply have not been evaluated in the context of current conditions. Potential new measures include,
but are not limited to: Permit requirements for new fishery sectors; reporting requirements for a fishery sector
other than longline fishing; effort limitations; quotas (for total catch or by species), including individual transferable
quotas; fractional licensing; or bycatch limits. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) A Pelagics Plan Team report (annual report or an in-season report), input from advisors, or input from NMFS or other
agencies will first bring attention to a problem or issue that needs to be addressed at the next Council meeting. In
its notice announcing the meeting, the Council will summarize the concern or issue raised, the party that has raised
the problem, and the extent to which it is a new problem or a problem that may require new management measures. The Council
will seek to identify all interested persons and organizations and solicit their involvement in discussion and resolution
of this problem through the Council process, and the Council meeting notice in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 will emphasize that this problem will be discussed and that proposed actions may result. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) The document presenting the problem to the attention of the Council will be distributed to all advisory bodies
of the Council who have not yet received it, with a request for comments. The document also will be distributed to the
Council's mailing list associated with the Fishery Management Plan to solicit comments and to indicate the Council
will take up action at the following meeting. The Council's chairperson may request the Council's Pelagics Standing
Committee to discuss the issue and review the comments (if any) of the Pelagics Plan Team, Advisory Panel, Pelagics
Review Board, or Scientific and Statistical Committee, and develop recommendations for Council action. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) At the meeting, the Council will consider the recommendations of its Pelagics Standing Committee, if any, and
other Council organizations and will take comments from the public concerning the possible course of action. If the
Council agrees to proceed with further action under the framework process, the issue will be placed on the agenda for
the following meeting. A document describing the issue, alternative ways to resolve the issue, the preferred action,
and the anticipated impacts of the preferred action, will be prepared and distributed to the public with a request
for comments. A notice will be published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 summarizing the Council's deliberations and preferred action and indicating the time and place for the Council meeting
to take final action. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5) In its notice for the following meeting, the Council will indicate that it may take final action on the possible
adjustment to regulations under this section. At the meeting, the Council will consider the comments received as
a result of its solicitation of comments and take public comments during the meeting on the issue or problem. The Council
will consider any new information presented or collected and analyzed during the comment period. The Regional Director
will be provided a specific opportunity to indicate any objections or concerns about any or all components of the measures
being considered. The Council will then decide whether to recommend a new measure or measures under this section.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(6) If the Council decides to proceed, it will submit its proposal to the Regional Director for consideration, with
supporting rationale and an analysis of the estimated biological, economic, and social impacts of the proposed actions.
The Council may indicate its intent that all components of its recommendations be approved or disapproved as a single
action. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(7) If the Regional Director concurs in whole or in part, the Secretary, in accordance with the Administrative Procedure
Act, may implement the approved new measure by publishing a final rule, waiving advance notice and comment. Nothing
in this procedure is intended to preclude the Secretary from deciding to provide additional opportunity for advance
notice and comment in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, but contemplates, that the Council process (which includes two Council meetings with opportunity for public comment
at each) will satisfy that requirement. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(8) If a new action is approved and implemented, future adjustments may be made under the procedure for established
measures. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(9) Nothing in this section limits the authority of the Secretary to take emergency action under section 305(c) of
the Magnuson Act.

<SUMMARY>
<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 -->
SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 These final regulations implement amendments to Section 721 of Title VII of the Defense Production Act of 1950 (the
``DPA''), as added by section 5021 of the Omnibus Trade and Competitiveness Act of 1988, relating to mergers, acquisitions,
and takeovers of U.S. persons by or with foreign persons, and as amended by section 837 of the National Defense Authorization
Act for Fiscal Year 1993. That amendment requires that the President or his designee undertake an investigation under
Section 721 of certain acquisitions which could result in control of U.S. persons by foreign government controlled
entities. It also expands the factors the President must consider in making a determination under Section 721, modifies
the existing congressional reporting requirement under Section 721, and requires that any designee of the President
under Section 721 share with any other designee a copy of an assessment made in a particular case of the risk of diversion
of a defense critical technology. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
These final regulations implement only those provisions relating to mandatory investigations, and also make a few
technical and conforming changes to the existing regulations. The statutory amendments pertaining to the factors
for Presidential decisionmaking and report sharing, which do not directly affect the behavior of parties filing
under Section 721, were deemed sufficiently straightforward not to require any implementing regulations.

 Section 136 of the Defense Production Act Amendments of 1992 (Pub. L. 102&hyph;558) amended section 709 of the DPA

 and that opportunity for public comment be provided for not less than thirty days. Although the Treasury Department
elected to provide a sixty day comment period for the regulations originally proposed to implement section 721, it
provided thirty days for public comment on these regulations, in light of their relatively routine nature. The proposed
regulations were published on February 16, 1994; just one written comment was received during the thirty-day comment
period. The preamble to the final regulations has been clarified to reflect this comment, and a few minor changes have
been made to the regulations themselves in response to suggestions from staff members of the Committee on Foreign
Investment in the United States.

These regulations implement amendments to Section 721 of the Defense Production Act of 1950 (50 U.S.C. App. 2170)(``DPA'').
Section 709 of the DPA (50 U.S.C. App. 2159) provides that the regulations issued under it are not subject to the rulemaking

). The impact of this final rule on small entities is expected to be insignificant. This final regulation imposes additional
informational requirements on entities controlled by foreign governments. Most businesses affected by this rule
will likely be large businesses, because these are the most likely to be controlled by a foreign government. Accordingly,
it is certified that the final rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities.

Discussion of the Final Rule 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 837(a) of the Defense Authorization Act creates for the first time a mandatory investigation provision under
Exon-Florio. There are three points worth noting about this provision. First, this provision is limited in application
to certain types of acquisitions. Specifically, the acquirer in question must be a foreign government controlled
entity, or an entity acting on behalf of a foreign government. Furthermore, the acquisition must be one which ``could
result in control of a person engaged in interstate commerce in the United States that could affect the national security
of the United States'' (emphasis added). Thus, even where the other specified criteria are met, this provision does
not mandate an investigation for cases that could not ``affect the national security of the United States.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Second, for purposes of determining whether the acquisition results in foreign government control, CFIUS is applying
the same functional test for control as provided in section 800.204. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Third, in contrast to the criterion for Presidential action under Exon-Florio, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
i.e.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, that the foreign party acquiring control might take action that ``threatens to impair the national security,''
the criterion for undertaking an investigation of transactions involving government controlled entities is that
there could be an effect on the national security. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The term ``foreign government'' has been broadly defined for purposes of these regulations to include any government
or body exercising governmental functions, and includes but is not limited to national as well as various regional
and local levels of government. It is important to note that the definition is not limited to the particular levels
of government that are specified in the regulation, and that other governmental bodies, including supra-national
entities such as the European Union (including its component parts), are covered by this regulation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For purposes of the mandatory investigation provision, the regulations define the term ``engage in'' as used in the
phrase ``seeks to engage in any merger, acquisition or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
takeover *&blank;*&blank;*'' to mean ``seeks to acquire control through.'' The purpose of this regulation is to
clarify that the mandatory investigation provision would not be triggered in cases where a foreign government controlled
entity's participation in an acquisition is solely for the purpose of investment, as defined in section 800.217 of
the regulations. The Committee believes that this reading is supported by the legislative history, and particularly
floor statements made by members of Congress who sponsored this particular amendment.

Rec. Oct. 3, 1992, page H 10986 (comments of Representative Collins). Subparagraph 800.402(c)(5)(iii) has been
changed in the final regulations by the addition of the words ``for example'' to clarify that an agency or representative
role are examples of ways in which a foreign person can act on behalf of a foreign government, but are not the only ways
in which such a relationship could be conducted.

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The United States Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) proposes conditional approval of the State Implementation
Plan (SIP) revision request submitted by the State of Illinois for the purpose of bringing about the attainment of
the National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS) for particulate matter with an aerodynamic diameter less than
or equal to a nominal 10 micrometers (PM). The SIP revision request was submitted by the State to satisfy the Federal
requirement for an approvable nonattainment area PM SIP for the Lake Calumet, McCook, and Granite City nonattainment
areas. These areas were designated nonattainment for PM and classified as moderate by the Clean Air Act (Act), upon
enactment of the 1990 Amendments (amended Act). The Act requires that States submit plans by November 15, 1991 for
those areas designated nonattainment and classified as moderate for PM upon enactment (the ``initial moderate nonattainment
areas'').

. The USEPA has issued a ``General Preamble'' describing USEPA's preliminary views on how USEPA intends to review
SIPs and SIP revisions submitted under title I of the Act, including those State submittals relating to moderate PM
nonattainment area SIP requirements (see generally 57 FR 13498 (April 16, 1992)). The reader should refer to the General
Preamble for a detailed discussion of the interpretations of title I and the supporting rationale.

The 1990 Amendments to the Act made significant changes to the air quality planning requirements for areas that do
not meet (or that significantly contribute to ambient air quality in a nearby area that does not meet) the PM national
ambient air quality standards (see Pub. L. No. 101&hyph;549, 104 Stat. 2399). References herein are to the Clean Air
Act, as amended, 42 U.S.C. 7401

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Part D of title I contains the provisions applicable to nonattainment areas. Moderate PM nonattainment areas must
meet the applicable requirements of subparts 1 and 4 of part D. Subpart 1 contains provisions generally applicable
to all nonattainment areas and subpart 4 contains provisions specifically applicable to PM nonattainment areas.
At times, Subparts 1 and 4 overlap or conflict. USEPA has attempted to clarify the relationship among these various
provisions in the General Preamble and, as appropriate, in this proposed rule.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Those States containing initial moderate PM nonattainment areas were required to submit, among other things, the
following provisions by November 15, 1991: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 02 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
1. Provisions to assure that reasonably available control measures (RACM) (including such reductions from existing
sources in the area as may be obtained through the adoption, at a minimum, of reasonably available control technology_RACT)
shall be implemented no later than December 10, 1993; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. Either a demonstration (including air quality modeling) that the plan will provide for attainment as expeditiously
as practicable but no later than December 31, 1994 or a demonstration that attainment by that date is impracticable;

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. Quantitative milestones which are to be achieved every 3 years and which demonstrate reasonable further progress
(RFP) toward attainment by December 31, 1994; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. Control requirements applicable to major stationary sources of PM precursors except where the Administrator
determines that such sources do not contribute significantly to PM levels which exceed the NAAQS in the area. See sections
172(c), 188, and 189 of the Act.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Some additional provisions are due at a later date. States with initial moderate PM nonattainment areas were required
to submit a permit program for the construction and operation of new and modified stationary sources of PM by June 30,
1992 (see section 189(a) of the Act). Such States also were required to submit contingency measures by November 15,
1993 which become effective without further action by the State or USEPA, upon a determination by USEPA that the area
has failed to achieve RFP or to attain the PM NAAQS by the applicable statutory deadline (see section 172(c)(9) and
57 FR 13543&hyph;13544).

II. This Action
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 110(k) of the Act sets out provisions governing USEPA's review of SIP submittals (see 57 FR 13565&hyph;13566).
USEPA proposes to conditionally approve the plan revision request submitted to USEPA on May 15, 1992, for the Lake
Calumet, McCook, and Granite City nonattainment areas because it strengthens the existing SIP. Public comments
are solicited on the requested SIP revision and on USEPA's proposed rulemaking action. The USEPA will consider any
comments received during the public comment period before taking final action on the requested SIP revision.

1. Procedural Background
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Act requires States to observe certain procedural requirements in developing implementation plans for submission
to USEPA. Section 110(a)(2) of the Act provides that each implementation plan submitted by a State must be adopted
after reasonable notice and public hearing.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The State of Illinois held a public hearing on October 21, 1991, in Chicago, and on October 29, 1991, in Edwardsville,
Illinois to entertain public comment on the implementation plan for the Lake Calumet, McCook, and Granite City nonattainment
areas. Following the public hearing the plan was adopted by the Illinois Pollution Control Board on April 9, 1992.
The plan was submitted to USEPA on May 15, 1992, as a revision to the SIP, with a request that USEPA approve the revision.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 The USEPA must determine whether a submittal is complete and therefore warrants further USEPA review and action (see
section 110(k)(1) and 57 FR 13565). The USEPA's completeness criteria for SIP submittals are set out at 40 CFR part
51, appendix V (1991), as amended by 57 FR 42216 (August 26, 1991). The USEPA attempts to make completeness determinations
within 60 days of receiving a submittal. However, a submittal is deemed complete by operation of law if a completeness
determination is not made by USEPA 6 months after receipt of the submission.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The SIP revision was reviewed by USEPA to determine completeness shortly after its submittal, in accordance with
the completeness criteria set out at 40 CFR part 51, appendix V (1991), as amended by 57 FR 42216 (August 26, 1991). The
submittal was found to be complete and a letter dated June 25, 1992, was forwarded to the Manager, Division of Air Pollution
Control, Illinois Environmental Protection Agency (IEPA) indicating the completeness of the submittal and the
next steps to be taken in the review process.

2. Accurate Emissions Inventory
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 172(c)(3) of the Act requires that nonattainment plan provisions include a comprehensive, accurate, current
inventory of actual emissions from all sources of relevant pollutants in the nonattainment area. Further, for the
attainment demonstration, the SIP must contain a comprehensive, accurate, and current inventory of allowable emissions
in the area. Because the submission of an emissions inventory is necessary to an area's attainment demonstration
(or demonstration that the area cannot practicably attain), the emissions inventory must be received with the submission
(see 57 FR 13539).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The emissions inventory for the three nonattainment areas contains emissions data for over 1000 process and fugitive
PM sources. The emissions inventory was received with the submittal of May 15, 1992. The base year for the emissions
inventory is 1991. A review of the emissions inventory has revealed that the emissions data for most emission units
are appropriate. However, USEPA has questioned the emission rates for several sources. The USEPA believes that Illinois
has underestimated emissions from the roof monitors for the Basic Oxygen Furnaces (BOFs) at Granite City Steel (GCS)
and Acme Steel; the quench towers at GCS, Acme Steel, and LTV Steel; the rotary kiln incinerator at CWM Chemical Services;
3 coal fired boilers at CPC International; and, 3 coal fired boilers at GM Electromotive Division. For further information
on the emissions rates, see the Technical Support Documents (TSDs) dated January 10, 1994, and April 25, 1994, available
at the above address.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A detailed description of the process and methodologies used by the IEPA to develop the emission inventory for the
three nonattainment areas was submitted in a report titled ``Emissions Inventory Report for McCook, Lake Calumet,
&amp; Granite City PM Study Areas'' which is part of the docket for this requested SIP revision. The report indicates
that industrial facilities were the primary concern in the three nonattainment areas. These facilities include
metal manufacturers, mineral product manufacturers, food/agriculture facilities, and other PM emitters.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
3. RACM (Including RACT)
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As noted, states which contain initial moderate PM nonattainment areas must submit provisions to assure that RACM
(including RACT) are implemented no later than December 10, 1993 (see sections 172(c)(1) and 189(a)(1)(C)). The
General Preamble contains a detailed discussion of USEPA's interpretation of the RACM (including RACT) requirement
(see 57 FR 13539&hyph;13545 and 13560&hyph;13561). The USEPA's interpretation of this requirement is set out here
only in broad terms.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The State should first identify available control measures evaluating them for their reasonableness in light of
the feasibility of the controls and the attainment needs of the area. A State may reject an available control measure
if the measure is technologically infeasible or the cost of the control is unreasonable. The state must demonstrate
that its submitted provisions provide for attainment of the NAAQS as expeditiously as practicable but no later than
December 31, 1994 (unless the State demonstrates that attainment by that date is impracticable). Therefore, if a
State adopts less than all available measures but demonstrates, adequately and appropriately, that RFP and attainment
of the PM NAAQS is assured, and application of all such available measures would not result in attainment any faster,
then a plan which requires implementation of less than all available measures may be approved as meeting the RACM requirement.
As a suggested starting point, USEPA has identified reasonably available control measures for sources of fugitive
dust, residential wood combustion, and prescribed burning (see 57 FR 18072&hyph;18074 (April 28, 1992)). The State
should add to the list of available measures in an area any measures that public commenters demonstrate may well be
reasonably available in a particular circumstance.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The RACT for a particular source is similarly determined. The USEPA's longstanding definition of RACT is the lowest
emission limitation that a particular source is capable of meeting by the application of control technology that
is reasonably available, considering technological and economic feasibility (see 57 FR 13541). Thus, USEPA recommends
that available control technology be applied to those existing sources in the area that are reasonable to control
in light of the attainment needs of the area and the feasibility of controls.

USEPA has issued technological and economic parameters that should be considered in determining RACT for a particular
source (see 57 FR 18073&hyph;18074).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
</FOOTNOTE>

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A State should submit a reasoned justification for partial or full rejection of any available control measure (including
any available control technology) that explains, with appropriate documentation, why each rejected control measure
is infeasible or otherwise unreasonable and, therefore, does not constitute RACM (or RACT) for the area. In those
PM nonattainment areas where mobile sources significantly contribute to the PM air quality problem, States also
must address the section 108(f) transportation control measures (see 57 FR 13561).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The submitted control measures for point sources in the Lake Calumet, McCook, and Granite City nonattainment areas
include a general grain loading limit of 0.03 grains per standard cubic foot (gr/scf), as well as control measures
for specific sources. The specific control measures consist of regulations that impose grain loading limits, pounds
per ton limits, and pounds per million british thermal units limits (lb/MMBTU). Other control measures for specific
sources are listed in sections 212.324, 212.362, 212.425, 212.458, and 212.464 of Title 35: Environmental Protection;
Subtitle B: Air Pollution; Chapter 1: Pollution Control Board, of the Illinois Administrative Code (35 IAC). The
new regulations impose tighter and more enforceable limits than the current SIP approved rules.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Compliance with the above mentioned point source limits will be determined by Method 201 or Method 201A of title 40
of the Code of Federal Regulations 40 CFR part 51, appendix M or Method 5, 40 CFR part 60, appendix A. See 35 IAC 212.108.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The control measures for the area sources consist of opacity limits for roadways, crushing and screening operations,
storage piles, and some material handling operations such as truck loading. Rule 35 IAC 212.316(b) imposes a 10 percent
opacity limit on screening and crushing operations. There is a 10 percent or 5 percent opacity limit on roadways, depending
on the roadway's location. Rule 35 IAC 212.316(d) imposes a 10 percent opacity limit on storage piles. Rule 35 IAC 212.316(e)(2)
imposes additional opacity limits for marine terminals, including a 10 percent opacity limit on truck and railcar
loading. Rule 35 IAC 212.316(f) imposes a 20 percent opacity limit for all sources in the three nonattainment areas
except for certain metal manufacturing and agricultural sources. These regulations impose stricter limits than
the current SIP approved statewide 30 percent opacity limit.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Measurement of opacity from area sources other than roadways and parking areas shall be determined by Method 9, 40
CFR part 60, appendix A. Opacity determinations for roadways and parking areas shall be determined by taking 3 opacity
readings for each vehicle pass. The first reading will be taken at the point of maximum opacity. The second reading
will be taken 5 seconds later and the third reading will be taken another 5 seconds later. After 4 vehicle passes, the
12 readings will be averaged. See 35 IAC 212.109. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 Illinois must resolve the emissions inventory issues raised in the preceding section and provide a modeled attainment
demonstration which reflects revisions to the emissions inventory. The measures determined to be necessary to demonstrate
attainment will be evaluated by USEPA to determine whether they meet the RACM/RACT requirement.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
4. Attainment Demonstration
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As noted, for its initial moderate PM nonattainment areas a state must submit a demonstration (including air quality
modeling) showing that the plan will provide for attainment as expeditiously as practicable but no later than December
31, 1994 (See section 189(a)(1)(B) of the Act). Alternatively, the State must show that attainment by December 31,
1994 is impracticable. In the General Preamble, USEPA indicated that the attainment demonstrations for the initial
moderate areas must follow existing modeling guidelines for PM or, if appropriate, may be developed consistent with
the supplemental attainment demonstration policy issued for initial moderate areas (see 57 FR 13539).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In the development of the three-area modeling analysis, IEPA followed a modeling protocol which had been reviewed
in 1990 by USEPA and found to be consistent with USEPA guidance. The following is a summary of the modeling details.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Industrial Source Complex short and long term models (ISCST and ISCLT, respectively) were chosen for this analysis
for their ability to handle different source types at multiple locations. ISCST version 90346 was used to perform
the 24-hour PM analysis, and ISCLT version 90008 was used to predict annual PM concentrations. Based on land-use analyses,
IEPA used rural dispersion coefficients for the McCook and Granite City areas, and urban dispersion coefficients
for the Lake Calumet area. As recommended by USEPA guidance, IEPA placed receptors at a resolution of 100 meters at
fencelines and in areas where high impacts had been indicated.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For the Lake Calumet area, IEPA used 5 years of meteorological data from two stations operated by the Lake County (Indiana)
Attainment Task Force in Hammond and Whiting, IN. These sites are representative of the meteorological conditions
at Lake Calumet, since they are nearby and they account for the effects of Lake Michigan. If on-site meteorological
data is not available, USEPA requires the use of at least 5 years of quality-assured data from the nearest or most representative
meteorological site. This practice ensures that potential worst-case meteorological conditions will be identified
and considered in the modeling analysis. Five years of National Weather Service data from Midway Airport was used
for the McCook area, and five years of data from the St. Louis, Missouri airport was used for the Granite City area.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Illinois' emissions inventory included stack sources, process fugitive sources, and open fugitive dust sources.
Generally, Illinois modeled process fugitive sources as volume sources and open fugitive dust sources as area sources
in the ISCST and ISCLT models. Building downwash was considered for those sources affected by nearby building turbulence.
Roof monitors and coke ovens were modeled as series of volume sources. Nonbuoyant process fugitive emission sources
such as crushers, screens, and conveyors were treated as area sources. Open fugitive emissions caused by material
handling and vehicle traffic on both paved and unpaved roads were modeled as area sources. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
IEPA used a screening procedure to evaluate the air quality impacts of sources operating at load levels below maximum
design capacity. Some sources caused maximum impacts at loads less than full capacity. The short term analyses for
the final attainment demonstration employed stack parameters and emission rates which represented the load levels
which gave the greatest ambient impacts. The annual analyses used stack parameters and emission rates which represented
average operating conditions.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Background PM concentrations in the area were determined from local monitored data. Three monitors are located in
the McCook area, three are located in the Lake Calumet area, and five are located in the Granite City area. IEPA used
wind direction information to eliminate portions of the monitored data from the background calculations, in order
to avoid double-counting emissions due to sources explicitly modeled. Growth factors which were developed using
each county's projected increases in vehicular traffic were applied to the background concentrations. Daily background
concentrations were then added to the modeled 24-hour average concentrations to obtain the final predicted totals.
In the long term modeling, Illinois used a single annual background value. The average annual background concentrations
used were 34.08, 28.39, and 29.99 micrograms per cubic meter (&mu;g/m
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
3
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
) for the Lake Calumet, Granite City, and McCook nonattainment areas respectively. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In the submitted modeled demonstrations, which use 5 years of meteorological data, a violation of the 24 hour NAAQS
is indicated when six exceedances of the 24 hour standard are predicted. The 24 hour PM standard is 150 &mu;g/m
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
3
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. Each receptor's predicted sixth highest 24 hour value is, therefore, compared to the standard. The highest, sixth
highest predicted 24 hour PM concentration at any receptor in the McCook area was 145.6 micrograms per cubic meter
(&mu;g/m
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. Thus, the modeling analysis predicts that the 24 hour NAAQS will be protected for all three areas. A modeled violation
of the annual PM standard is indicated when any receptor's 5 year arithmetic mean annual PM concentration exceeds
the annual PM standard of 50 &mu;g/m
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. The highest arithmetic mean annual PM concentration predicted by the modeling for the McCook area was 49.9 &mu;g/m
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
3
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
3
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. Therefore, the annual PM NAAQS will be protected in these areas.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Because of the length of time it may take to determine whether an area has attained the standards, USEPA recommends
that PM nonattainment area SIP submittals demonstrate maintenance of the PM NAAQS for at least 3 years beyond the applicable
attainment date. (See a August 20, 1991, memorandum from Fred H. Renner, Jr. to Regional Air Branch Chiefs titled ``Questions
and Answers for Particulate Matter, Sulfur Dioxide, and Lead'') While Illinois' submittal did take growth into account
in the modeling analysis, it did not adequately address maintenance of the NAAQS for PM in the nonattainment areas.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 The refined air quality modeling analysis supplied by IEPA in support of the Illinois PM plan indicates that the NAAQS
for PM will be protected under the proposed PM control strategies. As mentioned previously, Illinois must resolve
the issues pertaining to the emissions inventory and, where necessary, prepare a revised attainment demonstration
including a demonstration that the NAAQS will be maintained for 3 years beyond the attainment date. The control strategy
used to control PM emissions is summarized in the section of this notice titled ``RACM (including RACT)''. For a more
detailed description of the attainment demonstration and control strategy used, see the TSDs prepared in support
of this proposed rule.

5. PM Precursors
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The control requirements which are applicable to major stationary sources of PM must also apply to major stationary
sources of PM precursors, unless USEPA determines such sources do not contribute significantly to PM levels which
exceed the NAAQS in that area (see section 189(e) of the Act). The control requirements that apply to major stationary
sources in PM nonattainment areas generally include the following: reasonably available control technology, which
applies in moderate PM nonattainment areas; best available control technology, which applies in serious PM nonattainment
areas; and control requirements under the applicable new source review provisions, such as the lowest achievable
emission rate. The General Preamble contains a lengthy discussion on control requirements for PM precursors in moderate
nonattainment areas and on the type of technical information USEPA will rely on in making any determinations under
section 189(e) (see 57 FR 13539&hyph;13540 and 13541&hyph;13542). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 Weather stagnation is not characteristic of the three nonattainment areas. Reduction of precursor concentrations
would require reduction of indeterminately located sources well upwind of the nonattainment area. Control of precursors
in the nonattainment area would have little if any impact on particulate matter concentrations in the nonattainment
area. For this reason, it is appropriate to conclude that precursors do not contribute significantly to particulate
matter concentrations in the Lake Calumet, McCook, and Granite City nonattainment areas. Note that while USEPA is
making a general finding for this area, today's finding is based on the current character of the area including, for
example, the existing mix of sources in the area. It is possible, therefore, that future growth could change the significance
of precursors in the area. The USEPA intends to issue future guidance addressing such potential changes in the significance
of precursor emissions in an area.

6. Quantitative Milestones and Reasonable Further Progress (RFP)
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The PM nonattainment area plan revisions demonstrating attainment must contain quantitative milestones, which
are to be achieved every 3 years, until the area is redesignated attainment. The plan must also demonstrate RFP, as
defined in section 171(1), toward attainment by December 31, 1994 (see section 189(c) of the Act). Reasonable further
progress is defined in section 171(1) as such annual incremental reductions in emissions of the relevant air pollutant
as are required by part D or may reasonably be required by the Administrator for the purpose of ensuring attainment
of the applicable NAAQS by the applicable date.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
USEPA has indicated (see 57 FR 13539) that for the initial moderate PM nonattainment areas, the emissions reductions
progress made between the SIP submittal due date of November 15, 1991 and the attainment date of December 31, 1994,
(only 46 days beyond the November 15, 1994 milestone date) will satisfy the first milestone requirement. The de minimis
timing differential makes it administratively impracticable to require separate milestone and attainment demonstrations.
In implementing RFP for an initial moderate area, USEPA will review the attainment demonstration and control strategy
for the area and determine whether annual incremental reductions different from those provided in the SIP may reasonably
be required in order to ensure attainment of the PM NAAQS by December 31, 1994 (see section 171(1)). The control strategy
for the Lake Calumet, McCook, and Granite City nonattainment areas went into effect on May 11, 1993. At this time, it
is unknown if RFP has been achieved because a revised attainment demonstration is still pending. USEPA will make any
such determination in a separate action. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
7. Enforceability
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
All measures and other elements in the SIP must be enforceable both by the State and USEPA. See sections 172(c)(6),
110(a)(2)(A) and 57 FR 13556. The USEPA criteria addressing the enforceability of SIPs and SIP revisions were stated
in a September 23, 1987 memorandum (with attachments) from the Assistant Administrator for Air and Radiation, et.
al., entitled ``Review of State Implementation Plans and Revisions for Enforceability and Legal Sufficiency''
and with an attached memo with the same date and title which contained more detailed guidance from the Associate Enforcement
Counsel for Air Enforcement et. al. (see discussion at 57 FR 13541). The criteria include, for example, applicability
to sources, compliance date(s), compliance periods, test methods, recordkeeping requirements, and any exemptions
or variances. In addition to enforceable requirements, nonattainment area plan provisions must contain a program
that provides for enforcement of the control measures and other elements in the SIP (see section 110(a)(2)(C)). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The particular control measures contained in the SIP are addressed above under the section headed ``RACM (including
RACT).'' These control measures apply to the types of activities identified in that discussion, including, for example,
grain loading limits, pound per ton limits, and lb/MMBTU limits for point sources and opacity limits for roadways
and storage piles. The SIP provides that these control measures apply to the areas defined in section 212.324(a)(1).
These areas match the Lake Calumet, McCook, and Granite City nonattainment areas.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The State of Illinois uses two approaches to regulate PM emissions, ``testing'' and ``observation''. Testing is
the common approach to control particulate matter from large process emission sources. In this approach the emission
limit is set as allowable concentration, e.g. grain/scf, or an allowable emission factor, e.g. lbs/ton throughput.
Compliance with the emission limit is evaluated by initial emissions testing using an appropriate method. For PM,
the appropriate test methods are Method 201 and Method 201A of 40 CFR part 51, appendix M or Method 5 of 40 CFR part 60,
appendix A. Method 202 of 40 CFR part 51, appendix M is used if condensibles is also to be tested. Besides emissions tests,
compliance is determined by a combination of techniques, including reviewing operating records, observation of
stack opacity, and monitoring of stack opacity. These techniques are used to assure that the equipment is being operated
in a manner that is consistent with that used during testing. If the manner of operation deviates significantly from
that used during testing, the equipment must be restored to the manner of operation used during testing or the equipment
must be tested again. There are recordkeeping and reporting requirements that are used to help verify proper operation
and maintenance of the control equipment.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The second approach to control of particulate matter emissions, relies solely on visual observation of the exhaust.
This ``observation'' approach is particularly relevant where existing or small sources are being considered. This
approach determines whether or not visible emissions from equipment have exceeded opacity limitations.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Upon review of Illinois' submittal, USEPA has identified several enforcement concerns. They are as follows:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 02 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
a. On December 29, 1992, USEPA approved general opacity limitations for the State of Illinois. See 57 FR 61834. These
opacity limitations are found at subpart B under 35 IAC 212. Subpart B of 35 IAC 212 is a recodification of the former
Rule 202. These regulations impose a 30 percent opacity limit for most sources.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The coke oven regulations of the Illinois SIP exempt coke oven sources from all of Rule 202 of the State of Illinois Air
Pollution Control Regulations. This exemption in the state regulations was approved on September 3, 1981, (46 FR
44177) as Rule 203(d)(5)(B)(i) and is now codified as 35 IAC 212.443(a).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Currently, PM emissions from coke oven combustion stacks in Illinois are limited to 0.05 grains per dry standard cubic
foot (gr/dscf). USEPA conditionally approved this limit on September 3, 1981. Currently, coke oven combustion stacks
exist at LTV Steel, GCS, and Acme Steel. The LTV combustion stack is limited to a 0.03 gr/dscf by a Prevention of Significant
Deterioration (PSD) permit.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
USEPA inspectors have observed emissions of greater than 60 percent opacity at the LTV Steel coke oven combustion
stack. As recent stack tests have confirmed, this stack is not in compliance with its mass limit while emitting at this
opacity. However, without the benefit of an opacity limit, enforcement was delayed for months until stack test results
were obtained, even after high opacity emissions were observed. An opacity limit on this stack will better assure
compliance with the grain loading limit.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
To better assure compliance with the grain loading limit, the State needs to impose an opacity limit on the coke oven
combustion stacks that is reflective of their mass emission limit. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
b. USEPA considers the rules that apply to the electric arc furnace roof vents at American Steel Foundries to be unenforceable
because the stacks can not be tested for compliance. IEPA should develop an enforceable limit that is reflective of
the emissions which are in the modeled attainment demonstration.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
c. Section 212.107, Measurement Methods for Visible Emissions, states that Method 22 should be used for ``detection
of visible emissions''. This could be misinterpreted as requiring use of Method 22 for sources subject to opacity
limits as well as sources subject to limits on detectability of visible emissions. USEPA recommends revising the
language of the rule to state that ``For both process emission sources and fugitive particulate matter sources, a
determination as to the presence or absence of visible emissions shall be in accordance with Method 22 ...''.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
d. Measurement methods for opacity, visible emissions, and ``PM'' are in section 212.110, and in separate sections
212.107, 212.108, and 212.109. The measurement methods in these sections are not always consistent with each other.
USEPA recommends that the measurement methods in 212.107, 212.108, and 212.109 be integrated with section 212.110.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
e. Several of the submitted rules contain language which exempts sources with no visible emissions from mass emissions
limits. It is USEPA's understanding that the State intends for these exemptions to apply to small, well-controlled
sources. However, the way the exemptions are worded, they could be misinterpreted to exclude many other sources from
mass emissions limits. The rules containing these exemptions need to be more clear about exactly what sources are
to be exempt, and when.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
8. Contingency Measures
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As provided in section 172(c)(9) of the Act, all moderate nonattainment area SIPs that demonstrate attainment must
include contingency measures. See generally 57 FR 13543&hyph;13544. These measures were required to be submitted
by November 15, 1993 for the initial moderate nonattainment areas. On January 21, 1994, the USEPA made a finding that
Illinois had failed to submit the required PM contingency measures. If Illinois does not make a complete submission
of these contingency measures within 18 months of the findings letter, USEPA will be mandated to use its authority
under section 179(a) of the Act to impose at least one sanction identified in section 179(b) of the Act in the affected
nonattainment areas. Contingency measures should consist of other available measures that are not part of the area's
current control strategy. These measures must take effect without further action by the State or USEPA, upon a determination
by USEPA that the area has failed to make RFP or attain the PM NAAQS by the applicable statutory deadline. The USEPA will
take separate rulemaking action on the contingency plan for the Lake Calumet, McCook, and Granite City nonattainment
areas.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
III. USEPA's Proposed Rulemaking Action
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The USEPA proposes to grant conditional approval to the plan revision submitted to USEPA by the State of Illinois on
May 15, 1992, for the Lake Calumet, McCook, and Granite City PM nonattainment areas. Illinois' requested SIP revision
does not include a complete and accurate emissions inventory, which, in turn, leads to an unacceptable attainment
demonstration. However, the submitted regulations do require stricter limitations than the current applicable
SIP.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The conditional approval is based on the State's enforceable commitment to meet five requirements within one year
from the date of final conditional approval. The State submitted a letter on March 2, 1994, committing to meet these
requirements within one year of final conditional approval. The first requirement is for the State to adopt additional
enforceable control measures, if necessary, that will achieve attainment. The second requirement is for the State
to submit a complete and accurate emissions inventory (including corrected emissions estimates, as well as any new
control measures which may be needed) and an acceptable modeled attainment demonstration. The third requirement
is for the State to impose an opacity limit for coke oven combustion stacks which is reflective of their mass emission
limits. The fourth requirement is for the State to provide an appropriate regulation for the electric arc furnaces
at American Steel Foundries. The fifth requirement is for the State to correct the three other enforcement concerns
listed above as c-e under the heading ``Enforceability''. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If the State ultimately fails to meet its commitment within one year of final conditional approval, then USEPA's action
for the State's requested SIP revision will automatically convert to a final limited approval/disapproval. The
limited approval would entail approval of the submitted regulations into the Illinois SIP for their strengthening
effect, and disapproval of the attainment demonstration and the emissions inventory.

IV. Request for Public Comments
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
USEPA is requesting comments on all aspects of this proposed rule. As indicated at the outset of this notice, USEPA
will consider any comments received by June 24, 1994.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
V. Processing Procedures
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This action has been classified as a Table 2 action by the Regional Administrator under the procedures published in
the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 on January 19, 1989 (54 FR 2214&hyph;2225). On January 6, 1989, the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) waived Table
2 and Table 3 SIP revisions (54 FR 2222) from the requirements of section 3 of Executive Order 12991 for a period of 2 years.
The USEPA has submitted a request for a permanent waiver for Table 2 and 3 SIP revisions. The OMB has agreed to continue
the waiver until such time as it rules on USEPA's request. This request is still applicable under Executive Order 12866.
Nothing in this action should be constructed as permitting, allowing, or establishing a precedent for any future
request for revision to any SIP. Each request for revision to any SIP shall be considered separately in light of specific
technical, economic, and environmental factors and in relation to relevant statutory and regulatory requirements.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, USEPA must prepare a regulatory flexibility analysis assessing the impact of any proposed or final rule on small
entities. 5 U.S.C. 603 and 604. Alternatively, USEPA may certify that the rule will not have a significant economic
impact on a substantial number of small entities. Small entities include small businesses, small not-for-profit
enterprises, and government entities with jurisdiction over populations of less than 50,000.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
SIP approvals under section 110 and subchapter I, part D of the Act do not create any new requirements, but simply approve
requirements that the State is already imposing. Therefore, because the Federal SIP-approval does not impose any
new requirements, I certify that it does not have a significant impact on small entities affected. Moreover, due to
the nature of the Federal-state relationship under the Act, preparation of a regulatory flexibility analysis would
constitute Federal inquiry into the economic reasonableness of state action. The Act forbids USEPA to base its actions
concerning SIPs on such grounds.

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 On January 24, 1994, the United States Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) published a proposed rule proposing
to impose sanctions on Indiana under the discretionary authority granted USEPA under the Clean Air Act as amended
in 1990 (Act) for failure by the State to meet its commitment to adopt and submit an enhanced motor vehicle inspection
and maintenance (I/M) State Implementation Plan (SIP) revision as required by the Act for the Lake and Porter County
ozone nonattainment areas. The Indiana legislature passed the legislation required to support such a SIP revision
and on March 4, 1994, Indiana Governor Bayh signed the legislation. Because of this favorable action, USEPA is withdrawing
the January 24, 1994, proposed rule initiating the process to impose discretionary sanctions. In addition, USEPA
is also canceling the previously announced public hearings scheduled for February 16, 1994, in Valparaiso; for February
18, 1994, in New Albany; and for February 22, 1994, in Indianapolis which were postponed on February 15, 1993, by USEPA
because of significant progress made by the Indiana Legislature toward adoption of necessary legislation up to that
date.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 On January 24, 1994 (59 FR 3544), USEPA published a proposed rule proposing to impose sanctions on the State of Indiana
under the discretionary authority granted USEPA under section 110(m) of the Act for failure by the State to meet its
commitment to adopt and submit an I/M SIP revision as required by the amended Act for the Lake and Porter County ozone
nonattainment area. USEPA had notified Indiana by letter dated December 30, 1993 of its finding that Indiana had failed
to submit the required I/M SIP revision.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

The Indiana legislature subsequently passed Senate Bill 285 to support such a SIP revision, and on March 4, 1994, Indiana
Governor Bayh signed the Bill. Because of this favorable action, USEPA is withdrawing the January 24, 1994, proposed
rule initiating the process to impose discretionary sanctions. The USEPA is also canceling the previously announced
hearings scheduled for February 16, 1994, in Valparaiso; for February 18, 1994, in New Albany; and for February 22,
1994, in Indianapolis. This withdrawal terminates the discretionary sanctions process initiated by the January
24, 1994, proposed rule. The mandatory sanctions process under section 179 of the Act initiated by USEPA's December
30, 1993, finding that Indiana failed to submit the required SIP revision is not affected by this action. Under that
process, USEPA must impose sanctions within a certain time frame unless Indiana adopts and formally submits a complete
I/M SIP revision. Because of the recent March 8, 1994 United States Court of Appeals order concerning the issue of I/M
committal SIPs, (

the court, the State of Indiana will be subject to sanctions pursuant to 42 U.S.C. 7509.

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 EPA is proposing a limited approval/disapproval action of the State Implementation Plan (SIP) revision submitted
by the State of Maryland. This revision establishes and requires major new and modified sources of volatile organic
compounds (VOC) and nitrogen oxides (NO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=5 f=2 -->
x
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
) to meet the new source requirements which include the installation of Lowest Achievable Emission Rate (LAER) technology
and to obtain emission offsets. The intended effect of this action is to propose limited approval of new source review
requirements for major new and modified sources in Maryland for the limited purpose of strengthening the Maryland
SIP which currently has regulations which do not meet the Clean Air Act, as amended in 1990. In addition, this action
is intended to propose disapproval of Maryland Regulations COMAR 26.11.17 for the limited purpose of allowing Maryland
the opportunity to correct the deficiencies in the regulations which result in its failure to meet all requirements
of the Clean Air Act (CAA). This action is being taken in accordance with the provisions of section 110 of the Clean Air
Act.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 On June 8, 1993, the Maryland Department of the Environment submitted a revision to its State Implementation Plan
(SIP) pertaining to requirements for major new and modified sources of VOC and NO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=5 f=2 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 applicable statewide. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The revision consists of modifications to COMAR 26.11.01.01 (Definitions), 26.11.02 (Permits, Approvals and Registration)
sections .03, .09&hyph;.11, and .18, and an entirely new regulation, COMAR 26.11.17 (Requirements for Major New
Sources and Modifications). The modifications to COMAR 26.11.01.01 remove a portion of the definition of ``modification''
which was inconsistent with the Federal definition contained in 40 CFR 51.165, EPA's guidance to states on new source
requirements. In addition, Maryland introduces the term ``Major New Source Requiring Approval (MNSRA)'' which
is defined as a major stationary source or major modification subject to requirements in COMAR 26.11.17. COMAR 26.11.17
is an entirely new regulation in Maryland meant to replace its previous new source requirements which were located
in COMAR 26.11.06.11, General Emission Standards, Prohibitions and Restrictions&hyph;New Source Impacting on
a Nonattainment Area (NSINA) Prohibition for Areas III and IV. The proposed revisions to the Maryland SIP were submitted
in response to the requirements of the Clean Air Act, as amended on November 15, 1990. The only nonattainment areas
in Maryland are those designated nonattainment for ozone and those designated nonattainment for carbon monoxide.
The Clean Air Act requires that all states which have areas designated nonattainment for ozone or carbon monoxide
(CO), or states located in the Ozone Transport Region, to submit to EPA, by November 15, 1992 or November 15, 1993, respectively,
a revision to their SIPs which would require major new and major modified sources of those pollutants to meet new source
requirements.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
Federal Requirements
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
According to section 172(c)(5), state implementation plans must require permits for the construction and operation
of new or modified major stationary sources. The statutory permit requirements for ozone nonattainment areas are
generally contained in revised section 173, and in subpart 2 of part D. EPA is planning to update its new source review
rule for nonattainment areas in 40 CFR 51.165 and 52.24 in accordance with the Clean Air Act, as amended on November
15, 1990. At that time, states, including Maryland, will be expected to evaluate their new source regulations in accordance
with those new source rules and revise their regulations accordingly. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The requirements for new sources in nonattainment areas under sections 172, 173, 182, and 184 of the Act, include the
following:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 02 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
a. According to section 173(a)(1), provisions in the state regulation to assure that calculations of emissions offsets
are based on the same emissions baseline used in the demonstration of RFP. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
b. According to section 173(c)(1), states may include provisions which allow offsets to be obtained in another nonattainment
area if the area has an equal or higher nonattainment classification and emissions from the other nonattainment area
contribute to a NAAQS violation in the area in which the source would construct.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
c. According to section 173(c)(1), provisions in the state regulation that any emissions offsets obtained in conjunction
with the issuance of a permit to a new or modified source must be in effect and enforceable by the time the new or modified
source commences operation. This statutory condition for offsets augments the existing requirement under section
173 that provides that offsets must be federally-enforceable before permit issuance, although the required emissions
reductions need not occur until the date on which the new or modified source commences operations.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
d. According to section 173(c)(1), provisions in the state regulation to assure that emissions increases from new
or modified sources must be offset by real reductions in actual emissions. EPA's initial guidance interpreting general
sections of the Clean Air Act is contained in the title I General Preamble published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 on April 16, 1992 (57 FR 13498). In the General Preamble, EPA reiterated that emission increases and decreases for
netting are to be determined consistent with EPA's current new source rules and the December 4, 1986 emissions trading
policy statement (51 FR 43823). In addition, pre-enactment reductions are expected to be treated as new source growth,
even though, for applicability purposes, the source's net emissions change is de minimis. EPA's current new source
rules state that a decrease in emissions is only creditable if, among other requirements, the decrease has not been
relied upon by the state for any permit, attainment demonstration, or reasonable further progress. Therefore, emission
reductions made because of RACT or other requirements which have been taken into account in the state's demonstration
of reasonable further progress or attainment demonstration are not creditable for netting purposes.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
e. According to section 173(c)(2), provisions in the state regulation to prevent emission reductions otherwise
required by the Act from being credited for purposes of satisfying part D offset requirements.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
f. According to section 173(a)(5), provisions in the state regulation that, as a prerequisite to issuing any part
D permit, require an analysis of alternative sites, sizes, production processes, and environmental control techniques
for proposed sources that demonstrate that the benefits of the proposed source significantly outweigh the environmental
and social costs imposed as a result of its location, construction, or modification.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
g. According to section 328, provisions in the state regulation to assure that sources located on the OCS are subject
to the same requirements applicable if the source were located in the corresponding onshore area.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
h. Provisions in the state regulation to assure that owners or operators of each proposed new or modified major stationary
source demonstrate the compliance of all other major stationary sources under the same ownership in the State.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
i. Provisions in the state regulation defining major new and major modified sources in accordance with the area's
nonattainment classification under section 181 for ozone and section 186 for CO. j. Provisions in the state regulation
requiring emission offsets for major new and major modified sources in accordance with the area's nonattainment
classification under section 181 for ozone and section 186 for CO. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
k. Provisions in the state regulation requiring all applicable new source requirements for sources locating in the
Ozone Transport Region. For a severe or extreme ozone nonattainment area located in the transport region, the major
stationary source size thresholds applicable to those areas apply for VOC and, presumptively, for NO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
x
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. These provisions must also ensure that new or modified major stationary sources obtain VOC and, presumptively,
NO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
x
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 offsets at a ratio of at least 1.15 to 1 in order to obtain an NSR permit. Higher offset ratios apply in areas classified
as serious or above. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
l. Provisions in the state regulation to ensure that any new or modified major stationary source of NO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
x
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 exemption is granted by the Administrator under the provision of section 182(f).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
m. For serious and severe ozone nonattainment areas, state plans must implement sections 182(c)(6), (7) and (8) with
regard to modifications.

Nonattainment Area Requirements as They Pertain to Maryland 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Clean Air Act requirements under section 182, as they pertain to new sources in Maryland, specify that major sources
in the Baltimore severe ozone nonattainment area (Baltimore City, Baltimore, Anne Arundel, Carroll, Harford, and
Howard Counties) and in the Maryland portion of the Philadelphia severe ozone nonattainment area (Cecil County,
Maryland) be defined as those whose potential emissions of VOC are greater than or equal to 25 tons per year (TPY). In
addition, major sources in the Washington DC serious ozone nonattainment area (Calvert, Charles, Frederick, Montgomery,
and Prince George's Counties) are defined as those whose potential emissions of VOC are greater than or equal to 50
TPY. Section 182(f) of the Clean Air Act also requires that wherever sources of VOC are required to be controlled, nitrogen
oxide (NO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
x
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
) sources of the same size thresholds are required to be controlled. Therefore, in the Baltimore, Philadelphia, and
Washington DC ozone nonattainment areas, NO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
x
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 sources which have the potential to emit greater than or equal to 25 TPY, 25 TPY, and 50 TPY, respectively, are required
to be subject to new source requirements. Section 184 of the Clean Air Act also establishes, by operation of law, the
Ozone Transport Region (OTR), consisting of the states of Connecticut, Delaware, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts,
New Hampshire, New Jersey, New York, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Vermont, and the Consolidated Metropolitan Statistical
Area that includes the District of Columbia. The section 182 ozone nonattainment area requirements applicable to
moderate ozone nonattainment areas apply, at a minimum, in those areas located in the OTR. Section 184(b)(2) requires,
however, that instead of the 100 TPY major source threshold required in moderate areas outside the OTR, major sources
in the OTR be defined as those with potential emissions of 50 tons of VOC per year or more. Therefore, the remaining counties
in Maryland which are designated attainment for ozone but are located in the OTR, are required to apply new source requirements
to sources of VOC which have the potential to emit at least 50 tons of VOC per year. The Maryland counties which are designated
attainment but are located in the OTR are: Allegany, Caroline, Dorchester, Garrett, Kent, Queen Anne's, Somerset,
St. Mary's, Talbot, Washington, Wicomico, and Worcester Counties. In these areas, the CAA's 50 ton threshold for
VOC does not apply and the major NO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
x
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 sources are defined as those which have the potential to emit at least 100 tons of NO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
x
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 per year. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For its carbon monoxide nonattainment area, Maryland is required to define a major source of CO as one which has the
potential to emit at least 100 tons of CO per year. Installation of LAER and emission offsets at a greater than 1 to 1 ratio
are required for major new or major modified sources.

EPA Analysis
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Maryland's proposed changes to COMAR 26.11.01.01, Definitions, and 26.11.02 primarily relate to inserting the
new term for major sources, ``Major New Source Requiring Approval (MNSRA)'' and deleting the old term, ``New Source
Impacting on a Nonattainment Area (NSINA)''. The new term and definition are consistent with the Act. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 One substantive change made in COMAR 26.11.01.01 was to delete the portion of the definition of ``Modification''
which would consider an increase in hours of operation or in production rate as a modification unless those increases
are prohibited under any permit or approval conditions ``adopted by the Department.'' The Federal definition specifically
excludes increases in hours of operation or in production rate from being considered a modification for new source
applicability purposes unless those increases are prohibited under any federally enforceable condition. Maryland's
definition of ``Modification'' clarifies that the permits and approvals are those that are federally enforceable,
rather than just those adopted by the Department. Therefore, EPA is proposing to approve the ``Modification'' definition
in COMAR 26.11.01.01. EPA is also proposing to approve the other changes to COMAR 26.11.01.01 and 26.11.02. COMAR
26.11.02.18 contains a permit fee schedule for new or modified sources which Maryland has requested not be included
as part of the SIP approval. Therefore, EPA is proposing to approve COMAR 26.11.02, with the exception of .18. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Maryland's new proposed regulation, COMAR 26.11.17, contains the applicability criteria for determining what
sources would be considered major new or major modified sources for the purposes of applying new source requirements.
This regulation generally meets the requirement pertaining to baseline consistency with the RFP demonstration
by requiring all sources to treat emission reductions which occurred prior to January 1, 1991 as not creditable. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
COMAR 26.11.71.04 E provides that emissions reductions achieved by shutting down an existing source or permanently
curtailing production or operating hours below baseline levels are creditable if the reductions are permanent,
quantifiable, and federally enforceable, and only if such reductions occurred on or after January 1, 1991. However,
existing EPA regulations also provide that if a state does not have an EPA-approved attainment demonstration, then
post-January 1, 1991 reductions achieved by a shutdown or curtailment of production or operating hours are only creditable
if the state is current in its attainment planning obligations. See 54 FR 27286 (June 28, 1989). EPA's current rules
also require that even in nonattainment areas with approved attainment demonstrations, only those shutdown or curtailment
credits generated after the date of permit application are creditable. See 40 CFR part 51, appendix S. Therefore,
EPA is proposing a limited disapproval of COMAR 26.11.17 for the purpose of allowing Maryland the opportunity to correct
this provision by adding a requirement that in the absence of an approved attainment demonstration, Maryland must
be current in it attainment planning obligations in order for post-January 1, 1991 shutdown reductions to be creditable,
and to clarify that only post-application reductions are creditable.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA will be seeking comments in its 40 CFR parts 51 and 52 rulemaking on whether there is a need, in light of the revised
baseline date in the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990, to revisit the fundamental policies underlying the limitation
on the use of shutdown and curtailment credits for areas without approved attainment demonstrations. These policies
are reflected in EPA's current regulation at &sect;51.165(a)(3)(ii)(C), that were the subject of two earlier rulemakings
in 1980 and 1989. See 45 FR 52676 (August 7, 1980) and 54 FR 27274 (June 28, 1989). EPA notes that the Clean Air Act Advisory
Committee may independently review concerns about the effect of the NSR program on industrial growth in nonattainment
areas. These concerns include the crediting and availability of, among other things, emissions offsets. In particular,
EPA is taking comments on whether the current policy on the use of shutdown credits unevenly impacts urban vs. suburban
areas, including issues related to urban sprawl, commuting patterns, and demographics. Upon final EPA rulemaking
on parts 51 and 52, Maryland will have to amend its rule to the extent such amendment is required to make its new source
review rule consistent with that final rulemaking.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition, all sources located in the Maryland portion of the Philadelphia ozone nonattainment area and in the Baltimore
and Washington DC ozone nonattainment areas, as well as sources located in the remainder of the state which are one
of the sources in the source categories listed in 40 CFR part 51, appendix S, are required to include fugitive emissions
``to the extent quantifiable'' in the calculation of potential emissions. EPA understands the definition of fugitive
emissions, as provided for in the Maryland regulations, and as here modified by the phrase ``to the extent quantifiable,
to mean that emissions that could reasonably pass through a stack, chimney, vent, or other functionally equivalent
opening are not fugitive for NSR applicability threshold calculation purposes, regardless of whether those emission
actually pass through a stack, etc. See e.g., 40 CFR 51.166(b)(19). For example, an enclosed facility may have numerous
VOC emission points none of which is individually vented. If those emissions reasonably could be individually vented
or vented collectively through one or more stacks in this roof of the building, those emissions would not be fugitive
within the meaning of the Maryland regulations and must be considered in determining whether the source is major for
NSR purposes. In determining whether emissions could pass through a stack, etc..., ``reasonableness'' is to be broadly
construed. Thus, for any source category subject to a national standard under sections 111 and 112 that requires collection
and/or venting of emissions points, emission from such sources are not fugitive, because the collection/venting
requirement in that standard is deemed to be reasonable. Likewise, if the Maryland SIP or a permit issued by the state
requires collection/venting of certain emissions, this creates a presumption that similar emissions from any other
source in that category could also reasonably pass through a stack, etc., and, therefore, should not be considered
fugitive. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 COMAR 26.11.17.04 F. establishes the criteria for the location of VOC or NO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
x
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 offsets such that offsets must be obtained from the same ozone nonattainment area, as close to the proposed new source
as possible, and may be obtained from another ozone nonattainment area if that area is of an equal or higher classification
and if the emissions from this area contributes to a violation in the nonattainment area of the proposed new source.
This provision is consistent with the requirements of the Act.

COMAR 26.11.17.01 contains requirements that emissions offsets for proposed major new sources or major modified
sources be obtained no later than the time of commencement of construction of the major new or major modified source.
COMAR 26.11.17.05 requires that these emission offsets be state and federally enforceable by the new source's ``start-up
date.'' Section 173 of the CAA provides, however, that offsets are to be federally-enforceable before the permit
may be issued, even though such offsets need actually occur no later than the date the new source would commence operations.
Therefore, EPA is proposing a limited disapproval of COMAR 26.11.17 for the purpose of allowing Maryland to correct
this provision so as to provide for Federal-enforceability of offsets before permit issuance.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
COMAR 26.11.17.04 establishes the baseline for offsets as the actual emissions in the preceding 1 or 2 year period,
or some other period approved by the Department if more representative of normal source operations, but not to exceed
the SIP emission limitations. The effect of this requirement is to establish the baseline for offsets as the lower
of actual or SIP allowable emissions. Sources with no applicable SIP limitation are required to use actual emissions
as the baseline. Sources with SIP emission limitations that exceed their uncontrolled emissions must use the SIP
emission limitations as the baseline. The Maryland regulation does not satisfy the Clean Air Act requirement that
emission reductions otherwise required by the Act are not creditable for part D offsets. Therefore, EPA is proposing
a limited disapproval of COMAR 26.11.17 so that Maryland can correct this deficiency by modifying its regulation
by specifically stating that only those emission reductions not otherwise required by the Act are creditable for
emission offsets required by this regulation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
With regard to emission decreases which are creditable for netting, Maryland's regulation contains the condition
that emission decreases are only creditable if, among other requirements, they have not been relied upon by the state
for any permit, attainment demonstration, or reasonable further progress. COMAR 26.11.17.01, pertaining to netting
calculations, clearly requires emission reductions to be real so that actual emission reductions are obtained.
Therefore, the Maryland regulation satisfies the current Federal requirements for netting.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 COMAR 26.11.17.03 requires sources to perform an analysis of alternative sites, sizes, production processes, and
environmental control techniques in order to demonstrate that the benefits of the proposed source significantly
outweigh the environmental and social costs imposed as a result of its location, construction or modification. COMAR
26.11.17.03 also requires all sources owned and operated by the proposed new source's applicant to be in compliance
with all applicable emission limitations or in compliance with an approved federally enforceable compliance plan.
COMAR 26.11.17.01 (5) defines building, structure, facility or installation as including those activities on the
outer continental shelf to the extent required by and consistent with section 328 of the Act. EPA is proposing to approve
these three provisions as they meet the Act's requirements.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

Maryland's regulation defines major new and major modified sources of VOC and NO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
x
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (for ozone nonattainment areas and areas located in the OTR) and CO consistent with the requirements of the Act. Emission
offset ratios for each of these pollutants, consistent with the Act, are also required. The Maryland regulation pertaining
to applicability and emission offsets for ozone nonattainment areas and in the OTR is, however, not completely clear
in indicating that a source which emits both VOC and NO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
x
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 is potentially subject to new source requirements for both VOC and NO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
x
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. A source emitting both VOC and NO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
x
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 determines applicability of VOC requirements by individually summing its VOC emissions and comparing such sum to
the major source size threshold for VOC or the significance levels for VOC for major modifications. This source would
also be required to individually sum its NO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
x
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 emissions and determine applicability by comparing this sum to the major source size threshold for NO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
x
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 or the significance levels for NO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
x
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 for major modifications. Likewise, VOC and NO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
x
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 sources which are required to obtain emission offsets must obtain offsets of the same type of pollutant (i.e. VOC for
VOC and NO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
x
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 for NO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
x
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
). Maryland may choose to retain the applicability determination to sum both VOC and NO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
x
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 emissions at a source to determine new source applicability since this is more stringent than the Federal requirements.
Maryland must, however, require that emission offsets are obtained for the same pollutant as that which is increased.
For this reason, EPA is proposing a limited disapproval of COMAR 26.11.17 in order to allow Maryland the opportunity
to clarify the applicability and the creditability of emission offsets.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Maryland regulation also states that nothing in the regulation itself is meant to conflict with sections 182(c)(7)
and (8) of the Clean Air Act. These two sections of the Act pertain to de minimis provisions which would allow sources
located in serious or severe ozone nonattainment areas to opt out of Lowest Achievable Emission Rate (LAER) technology
if they obtain 1.3 to 1 internal offsets. Maryland has chosen to incorporate the requirements of section 182(c)(6),
pertaining to determining de minimis levels in serious and severe ozone nonattainment areas, into its regulation
at COMAR 26.11.17.01. Until EPA issues its new source rule, the Maryland regulation as written is approvable. As mentioned
earlier, when EPA issues its new source rule, Maryland will be expected to evaluate its regulation for consistency
with that rule and make any appropriate changes to its regulation.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Maryland's proposed regulation also appropriately defines major new carbon monoxide sources to obtain LAER and
emission offsets at a minimum of 1.1 to 1 in CO nonattainment areas. These nonattainment areas are defined in 40 CFR
81.321 and located in the Baltimore and metropolitan Washington DC areas. EPA is proposing to approve these CO provisions,
as they meet the Act's requirements.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Because of the above deficiencies, pertaining to applicability determinations, emission offset calculations,
and eligibility of emission reduction credits, EPA cannot grant full approval of this rule under section 110(k)(3)
and part D. Also, because the submitted rule is not composed of separable parts which meet all the applicable requirements
of the CAA, EPA cannot grant partial approval of the rule under section 110(k)(3). However, EPA may grant a limited
approval of the submitted rule under section 110(k)(3) in light of EPA's authority pursuant to section 301(a) to adopt
regulations necessary to further air quality by strengthening the SIP. The approval is limited because EPA's action
also contains a simultaneous limited disapproval, due to the fact that the rule does not meet the section 182(a)(2)(A)
requirement of part D because of the noted deficiencies. Thus, in order to strengthen the SIP, EPA is proposing a limited
approval of Maryland's submitted COMAR 26.11.01.01 and 26.11.17 under section 110(k)(3) and 301(a) of the CAA.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
At the same time, EPA is also proposing a limited disapproval of the Maryland new source rule because it contains implementation
problems and deficiencies which result in less than the full population of required major new sources to be regulated,
and, as such, the rule does not fully meet the requirements of part D of the Act. Under section 179(a)(2), if the Administrator
disapproves a submission under section 110(k) for an area designated nonattainment, based on the submission's failure
to meet one or more of the elements required by the Act, the Administrator must apply one of the sanctions set forth in
section 179(b) unless the deficiency has been corrected within 18 months of such disapproval. Section 179(b) provides
two sanctions available to the Administrator: Highway funding and offsets. The 18 month period referred to in section
179(a) will begin at the time EPA publishes final notice of this disapproval. Moreover, the final disapproval triggers
the 24-month Federal implementation plan (FIP) requirement under section 110(c).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA's review of this material indicates that COMAR 26.11.01.01, COMAR 26.11.17.02, .09&hyph;.11 are fully approvable.
EPA is proposing to approve COMAR 26.11.17 for the limited purpose of strengthening the Maryland SIP with respect
to new source requirements in nonattainment areas and areas located in the ozone transport region. EPA is also proposing
a limited disapproval of COMAR 26.11.17 for the limited purpose of allowing Maryland the opportunity to correct the
above-identified deficiencies in the regulation so that the regulation can meet Clean Air Act requirements. If Maryland
corrects the specific deficiencies cited above and submits the corrected regulation to EPA prior to the final rulemaking
action, EPA intends to take final action on the June 8, 1993 submittal and the subsequent submittal which corrects
the Maryland new source regulation, without another proposal. Of course, in the event that the parts 51 and 52 rulemaking
is finalized prior to final action on this submittal, Maryland's new source review regulations may be subject to reproposal.
Further discussion of the Maryland new source review regulation is contained in the accompanying technical support
document. EPA is soliciting public comments on the issues discussed in this document or on other relevant matters.
These comments will be considered before taking final action. Interested parties may participate in the Federal
rulemaking procedure by submitting written comments to the EPA Regional office listed in the

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
EPA is proposing to approve the COMAR 26.11.01.01, 26.11.02. sections .03, .09&hyph;.11, and COMAR 26.11.17 (with
the exception of 26.11.17.18), pertaining to new source review requirements in nonattainment areas and in the ozone
transport region. At the same time, EPA is also proposing to disapprove COMAR 26.11.17 for the limited purpose of allowing
Maryland to correct deficiencies in the regulation such that the Act's requirements can be met. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 Nothing in this action should be construed as permitting or allowing or establishing a precedent for any future request
for revision to any state implementation plan. Each request for revision to the state implementation plan shall be
considered separately in light of specific technical, economic, and environmental factors and in relation to relevant
statutory and regulatory requirements.

 on January 19, 1989 (54 FR 2214&hyph;2225), as revised by an October 4, 1993 memorandum from Michael H. Shapiro, Acting
Assistant Administrator for Air and Radiation. A future document will inform the general public of these tables.
On January 6, 1989, the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) waived Table 2 and Table 3 SIP revisions (54 FR 2222) from
the requirements of section 3 of Executive Order 12291 for a period of two years. The USEPA has submitted a request for
a permanent waiver for Table 2 and 3 SIP revisions. The OMB has agreed to continue the waiver until such time as it rules
on USEPA's request. This request continues in effect under Executive Order 12866, which superseded Executive Order
12291 on September 30, 1993.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Administrator's decision to approve or disapprove this SIP revision, pertaining to Maryland's new source review
regulations, will be based on whether it meets the requirements of

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 This proposed rule extends the time frame providers 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
have to file cost reports from no later than 3 months after 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the close of the period covered by the report to no later 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
than 5 months after the close of that period. This change 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
is necessary to ensure that providers have an adequate 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
amount of time to file complete and accurate cost reports. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
We are also proposing to define what HCFA considers to be an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
``acceptable'' cost report submission.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
I. Background 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 1815(a) of the Social Security Act (the Act) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requires that each provider participating in the Medicare 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
program submit information (as requested by the Secretary) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in order to determine the amount of payment due to the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
provider for services furnished under the Medicare program. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Implementing regulations at 42 CFR 413.24(f) require that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
participating providers submit cost reports that generally 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
cover a consecutive 12-month period of the provider's 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
operations. Section 102 of the Provider Reimbursement 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Manual (PRM), HCFA Publication 15&hyph;II, states that a provider 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
may select any annual period for Medicare cost reporting 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
purposes regardless of the reporting period it uses for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
other purposes. Once a provider has informed HCFA of its 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
selection, HCFA requires it to report annually thereafter 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for periods ending on the same date unless that provider's 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
intermediary approves a change in the provider's reporting 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
period. The intermediary makes interim payments to the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
provider during the provider's cost reporting year. Based 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
on the annual cost report, a retroactive adjustment is made 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
after the end of the provider's cost reporting year to bring 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the interim payments made during the period into agreement 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
with the reimbursable amount payable to the provider.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 413.24(f)(2)(i) specifies that cost reports are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
due on or before the last day of the third month following 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the close of the period covered by the report. Section 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
413.24(f)(2)(ii) states that the intermediary may grant a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
30-day extension of the due date, for good cause, after 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
first obtaining the approval of HCFA. Section 104.A.2 of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the PRM requires that in order to obtain an extension, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
provider must submit a written request and obtain written 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
approval from its intermediary before the cost report due 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
date. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A provider that voluntarily or involuntarily terminates 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
its participation in the Medicare program, or experiences a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
change of ownership, must file a cost report no later than 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
45 days following the effective date of the termination of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the provider agreement or the change of ownership, as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
required by &sect;413.24(f)(2)(iii). HCFA will not grant an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
extension of the cost report due date in either of these 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
situations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
To ensure timely receipt of the cost reports, section 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2231.1 of the Intermediary Manual, Part 2, requires that the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
intermediary send a ``reminder'' letter to the provider at the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
end of the second month following the end of the cost 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reporting period. The letter advises the provider of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
due date for filing the cost report and informs the provider 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that its interim payments will be reduced or suspended if 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the cost report is not received on or before the last day of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the third month following the close of the period covered by 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the report. However, as allowed by &sect;413.24(f)(2)(ii), the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
provider may, for good cause, request that the intermediary 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
grant a 30-day extension of the due date of the cost report. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If the intermediary does not receive the cost report by the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
required due date (including an extension if approved), the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
intermediary sends the first of three ``demand'' letters to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the provider requesting the submission of the provider's 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
cost report and informing the provider of the percentage by 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
which its interim payment rate will be reduced. The letter 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
also states that further delay in filing the cost report 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
will result in an additional reduction in the interim rate 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and, ultimately, a suspension of interim payments. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
HCFA regulations at 42 CFR 405.376 set forth specific 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
rules for the payment of interest on Medicare overpayments 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and underpayments. Interest is assessed unless the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
intermediary recoups the overpayment or the intermediary 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
pays the provider an amount equal to the underpayment within 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
30 days of a ``final determination.'' When a provider does 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
not file its cost report timely, all interim payments 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
advanced for the period are considered overpayments, and a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
final determination is deemed to occur on the day after the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
date the cost report was due. Interest accrues on the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
deemed overpayment until the provider files the cost report, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
after which the usual audit rules and procedures regarding 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
overpayment determinations apply. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
HCFA has established a Provider Statistical and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Reimbursement System (PS&amp;R) to assist intermediaries in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reconciling provider cost reports. This system provides a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
number of reports to be used in developing and auditing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
provider cost reports. HCFA prepares the reports for each 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
participating provider. These reports contain Medicare 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
charge and reimbursement information compiled by the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
provider's fiscal year. One of these reports, the Provider 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Summary Report, is sent to providers by their intermediaries 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in order to assist the providers in preparing their cost 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reports. The Provider Summary Report contains information 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
about charges, Medicare patient days, coinsurance days, etc. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
HCFA requires the intermediaries to furnish the Provider 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Summary Report to each provider within 60 days following the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
end of the provider's fiscal year. The provider then has 30 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
days to submit its completed cost report to its intermediary 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(60 days if an extension has been granted.) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Another system that provides useful cost report data is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the Hospital Cost Report Information System (HCRIS). This 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
system is an automated data collection, data processing, and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
report generation system. HCRIS contains provider cost 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
report data from all Medicare-participating hospitals, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
skilled nursing facilities, and end-stage renal disease 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
facilities. HCRIS functions as the single cost report 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
collection and dissemination point for Medicare cost report 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
data. We use HCRIS to produce several standard files for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the analysis of Medicare cost report data. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For purposes of maintaining the HCRIS data base, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Medicare intermediaries currently must submit an extract of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
provider cost report data to HCFA within either 180 days of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the end of the hospital cost reporting period or 60 days of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
receipt of the cost report from the provider, whichever is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
later. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

II. Provisions of the Proposed Regulations 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
A. Due Dates for Filing Cost Report 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This proposed rule would increase the amount of time a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
provider has to file its cost report. Presently, under 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&sect;413.24(f)(2)(i), a provider must file its cost report on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
or before the last day of the third month following the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
close of the period covered by the report. Under this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proposed rule, the provider would be required to file an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
acceptable cost report, as defined at new &sect;413.24(f)(5), on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
or before the last day of the fifth month following the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
close of the period covered by the report (that is, if a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
provider's cost reporting period ends June 30, 1994, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
provider would have from July 1, 1994 through November 30, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1994 to file its cost report.) For cost reporting periods 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ending on a day other than the last day of a month, cost 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reports would be due 150 days after the last day of the cost 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reporting period. (In accordance with &sect;405.376(e)(3), 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
interest would not begin to accrue until the day following 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the due date of the report.) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In proposing this change, we are responding to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
objections from providers to the current 3-month time frame, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
which many providers believe creates an undue burden on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
their financial departments. For example, in a recent cost 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
report extension survey report, many providers cited 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
problems in getting accurate PS&amp;R data as a primary reason 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for requesting an extension. Under this proposed rule, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
additional time providers would have to submit their cost 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reports also would allow the intermediaries additional time 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to prepare the necessary PS&amp;R reports. With the additional 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
time, we believe that the intermediaries would be able to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
provide more accurate and complete PS&amp;R data to the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
providers, which would, in turn, result in providers 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requiring less time to reconcile the PS&amp;R data with their 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
records. The providers also would have additional time to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
prepare their books and records, complete the necessary 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
audits and develop financial statements and reports that are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
needed before providers can complete the cost reporting 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
forms. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
We are also proposing to change the regulations at 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&sect;413.24(f)(2)(ii) that allow an intermediary to grant, for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
good cause, a 30-day extension of the due date after first 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
obtaining the approval of HCFA. Since we believe that the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
time frame we are proposing for the filing of the cost 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
report (5 months) is sufficient, we propose that extensions 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
may be granted by the intermediary only when a provider's 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
operations are significantly adversely affected due to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
extraordinary circumstances over which the provider has no 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
control. An example of such extraordinary circumstances 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
might be a flood or a fire that forced a provider to cease 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
operations and transfer its patients temporarily to other 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
providers outside of the impacted area. The intermediary 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
would still be required to obtain HCFA approval. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
We are also proposing to delete &sect;413.24(f)(2)(iii), 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
which now states that the cost report from a provider that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
voluntarily or involuntarily ceases to participate in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Medicare program or experiences a change of ownership is due 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
no later than 45 days following the effective date of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
termination of the provider agreement or change of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ownership. We do not believe the current 45-day period is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
sufficient time for these providers to file a final cost 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
report. Instead, as a result of the proposed deletion of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&sect;413.24(f)(2)(iii), providers in these cirumstances would 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
be permitted the same amount of time to file a cost report 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
as other providers. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
B. Acceptable Cost Report Submissions 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
We are also proposing to define at &sect;413.24(f)(5) what 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
HCFA considers to be an acceptable cost report submission. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Provisions of the proposed definition are as follows: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;All providers: The provider must complete and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
submit the required cost reporting forms, including all 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
necessary signatures, and also must submit all supporting 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
documentation required by the intermediary (for example, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
working trial balance; HCFA Form 339, Provider Cost Report 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Reimbursement Questionnaire; and copies of audited financial 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
statements). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Providers that are required to file electronic cost 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reports: In addition to completing and submitting the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
required cost reporting forms and supporting documentation, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the provider also must submit its cost reports in an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
electronic cost report format in conformance with the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requirements contained in section 130 of the Electronic Cost 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Report (ECR) Specifications Manual (unless the hospital has 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
received an exemption from HCFA.) These requirements 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
include the electronic file passing all of the fatal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(level 1) edits contained in the ECR Specifications Manual. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
An acceptable cost report submission also must include all 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of the appropriate signatures. (Additional instructions 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
concerning electronic submission of cost reports can be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
found at &sect;413.24(f)(4), as set forth in our final rule with 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
comment period published elsewhere in this issue of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition, we would specify that the intermediary is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to make a determination of acceptability within 30 days of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
receipt of the cost report. If the intermediary considers 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the cost report unacceptable, the intermediary returns it to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the provider with a letter explaining the reasons for the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
rejection (for example, the cost report failed a fatal edit 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
or included incomplete documentation). When the cost report 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
is rejected, it is deemed an unacceptable submission and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
treated as if a report had never been filed. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
intermediary would also inform the provider of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
consequences of filing a late cost report, that is, interest 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
would be assessed on all overpayments and the provider's 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
interim payments would be suspended. Given the additional 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
filing time, we believe providers should have sufficient 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
time to complete and submit an acceptable cost report. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Thus, we are suspending all payments if the cost report is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
not filed within the 5-month timeframe. The provider should 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
make the necessary corrections to the cost report and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
resubmit the cost report to the intermediary as quickly as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
possible.

III. Related Issues 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As a result of these proposed regulation changes, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
timing of provider reminder letters, PS&amp;R Summary Reports 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and the submission of HCRIS data would also be affected. We 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
plan to revise the Intermediary Manual and the PRM as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
necessary to reflect these changes. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
A. Reminder Letters 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Because we are proposing to lengthen the amount of time 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a provider has to file its cost report, we also would change 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the deadline for the intermediaries to send reminder letters 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to providers to notify them that cost reports are due. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
revised deadline would be by the end of the fourth month 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
after the close of the cost reporting period. The reminder 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
letter may be sent at the same time an intermediary sends 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the PS&amp;R Summary Report to the providers, but an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
intermediary may not send the reminder letter before sending 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the PS&amp;R Summary Report. The reminder letter will inform 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the provider that if the cost report is not received by the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
end of the fifth month after the close of the cost reporting 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
period, the provider's interim payments will be suspended in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
their entirety the following day, rather than just reduced 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(as the Intermediary Manual now provides). Under 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&sect;405.371(d), if a provider does not furnish necessary 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
information that is needed to determine the amounts due the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
provider under the Medicare program, interim payments may be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
suspended immediately. In addition, under &sect;405.376(e) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
interest will be assessed immediately in the case of a cost 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
report that is not filed on time. However, given the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
extended filing deadline, we believe that providers should 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
have little difficulty in filing timely. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
B. PS&amp;R Summary Report 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In conjunction with the change in the cost report due 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
dates, we also intend to revise our Manual instructions to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
extend the time that HCFA allows the intermediaries to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
furnish the PS&amp;R Summary Report to providers. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Intermediaries would be required to furnish the PS&amp;R Summary 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Report by the last day of the fourth month following the end 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of the provider's cost reporting period, instead of 60 days 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
following the end of the provider's cost reporting period, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
as is currently the practice. For cost reporting periods 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ending on a day other than the last day of a month, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
intermediaries would be required to furnish the PS&amp;R Summary 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Report by the 120th day following the end of a provider's 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
cost reporting period. As noted above, an intermediary must 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
send the PS&amp;R Summary Report to a provider before or at the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
same time as it sends the reminder letter. (The reminder 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
letter cannot be sent before the PS&amp;R Summary Report.) This 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
change would ensure that a provider still would have at 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
least 30 days after receipt of the PS&amp;R Summary Report to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
complete and submit the cost report to the intermediary. If 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the provider receives the PS&amp;R Summary Report later than the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
last day of the fourth month (or the 120th day, if 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
applicable) following the end of its cost reporting period, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the provider would have 30 days from receipt to file its 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
cost report. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
C. HCRIS Data 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Presently, the intermediary must submit HCRIS data to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
HCFA within either 180 days of the end of the hospital cost 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reporting period or 60 days of receipt of the cost report 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
from the provider, whichever is later. The current 180-day 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
deadline is based on the following: (1) 90 days for a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
provider to file its cost report, (2) 30 days for an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
extension of time to file (available to providers with good 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
cause), and (3) an additional 60 days for the intermediary 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to submit HCRIS data to HCFA. In conjunction with the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proposed extension of the deadline for filing a cost report, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
we would revise the Intermediary Manual to instruct 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
intermediaries to submit HCRIS data to HCFA within 210 days 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of the last day of the hospital cost reporting period. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
new deadline is based on the following: (1) 150 days for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
filing a cost report and (2) 60 days for submission of HCRIS 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
data to HCFA. The 30-day extension of time to file a cost 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
report would be eliminated. As explained above, extensions 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
would be granted only under extraordinary circumstances, and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
therefore an additional 30 days for a filing extension 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
normally would not be necessary. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition, we plan to revise our Manual instructions 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to specify that if the intermediary is late in sending the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
PS&amp;R Summary Report to the providers, the amount of time for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the intermediary to submit the HCRIS data would be reduced 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
by the same number of days the PS&amp;R Summary Report was late. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For example, if the intermediary sends the PS&amp;R Summary 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Report to the provider 10 days late, the provider would 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
still have 30 days from receipt of the PS&amp;R Summary Report 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to file its cost report. However, the time remaining for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the intermediary to submit the HCRIS data would be reduced 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
by a corresponding 10 days (that is, from 60 to 50 days 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
following receipt of the cost report.) In such cases, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
intermediary still would have a total of 210 days from the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
end of the hospital cost reporting period to submit HCRIS 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
data to HCFA. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As explained above, the overall effect of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
extension of the time frame for providers to file cost 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reports would be that HCFA would not have access to updated 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
HCRIS data until 210 days after the end of a given cost 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reporting period. This change would not delay significantly 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the availability of the analytical files (which are updated 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
quarterly) in HCRIS, and it should improve the accuracy of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
initial cost report data. Although it would delay the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
availability in the analytical files of cost report data for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the most recent cost reporting period, it would not affect 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
availability of a complete set of cost report data. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under the current requirements for intermediaries to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
transmit cost report data extracts, a complete set of cost 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
report data for any Federal fiscal year is not available 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
until 180 days after the latest cost reporting period in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Federal fiscal year. For example, if a provider's cost 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reporting period begins on September 1, 1993 and ends on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
August 31, 1994, its cost report extract now would be due to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
HCFA by February 27, 1995 (180 days after the end of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
cost reporting period). The data would be available for use 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in the next quarterly update of the analytical files, which 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
would take place on March 31, 1995. In this case, under the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proposed provisions, we would extend the due date for HCRIS 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
submissions from 180 days after the hospital cost reporting 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
period ends to within 210 days of the last day of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
hospital's cost reporting period. Thus, in the above 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
example, the cost report extract of a provider with a cost 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reporting period ending August 31, 1994, would be due to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
HCFA by March 29, 1995. The data from this provider's file 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
still would be available for use in the March 31, 1995 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
update of the analytical files.

IV. Impact Statement 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
We generally prepare a regulatory flexibility analysis 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that is consistent with the Regulatory Flexibility Act (RFA) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5 U.S.C. 601 through 612) unless the Secretary certifies 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that a proposed rule would not have a significant economic 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
impact on a substantial number of small entities. This 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proposed rule would extend from 3 months to 5 months the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
time frame that providers have to file their cost reports 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and would define what HCFA considers to be an ``acceptable'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
cost report submission. Neither of these proposed changes 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
would have a significant economic impact on providers. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Therefore, we have determined, and the Secretary certifies, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that this proposed rule would not have a significant effect 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
on a substantial number of small entities. Thus, we are not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
preparing a regulatory flexibility analysis. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 1102(b) of the Act requires the Secretary to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
prepare a regulatory impact statement if a proposed rule may 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
have a significant economic impact on the operations of a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
substantial number of small rural hospitals. Such an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
analysis must conform to the provisions of section 603 of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the RFA. For purposes of section 1102(b) of the Act, we 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
define a small rural hospital as a hospital that is located 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
outside of a Metropolitan Statistical Area and has fewer 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
than 50 beds. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
We are not preparing a regulatory impact statement 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
since we have determined, and the Secretary certifies, that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
this proposed rule would not have a significant economic 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
impact on the operations of a substantial number of small 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
rural hospitals. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In accordance with the provisions of Executive Order 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
12866, this regulation was not reviewed by the Office of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Management and Budget.

A. Public Comment 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Because of the large number of pieces of correspondence 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
we normally receive on a proposed rule, we are not able to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
acknowledge or respond to them individually. However, in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
preparing the final rule, we will consider all comments that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
we receive by the date specified in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
Dates
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) Extensions of the due date for filing a cost 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
report may be granted by the intermediary only when a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
provider's operations are significantly adversely affected 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

(5) An acceptable cost report submission is defined as

follows: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) All providers._The provider, in addition to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
completing and submitting the required cost reporting forms, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
including all necessary signatures, must submit all 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
supporting documentation required by program instructions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) For providers that are required to file electronic 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
cost reports._In addition to the forms and documentation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
required in paragraphs (f)(4) and (f)(5)(i) of this section, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the provider must submit its cost reports in an electronic 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
cost report format in conformance with the requirements 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
contained in the Electronic Cost Report (ECR) Specifications 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Manual (unless the provider has received an exemption from 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
HCFA). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) The intermediary makes a determination of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
acceptability within 30 days of receipt of the provider's 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
cost report. If the cost report is considered unacceptable, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the intermediary returns the cost report with a letter 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
explaining the reasons for the rejection. When the cost 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
report is rejected, it is deemed an unacceptable submission 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and treated as if a report had never been filed.

SUMMARY: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
On April 7, 1994; (59 FR 16592), the Federal Maritime Commission published a proposed rule to, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=3 -->
inter alia,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 amend its regulations governing financial reporting requirements and rate of return methodology applicable to
vessel-operating common carriers by water in the domestic offshore trades to discontinue use of the comparable earnings
test in determining the reasonableness of a carrier's return on rate base. In its place, the Commission proposes to
use the weighted average cost of capital methodology. Matson Navigation Company requests an extension of the comment
period. Its request is granted.

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Commission is proposing to revise its regulations pertaining to registration by motor carriers with States.
The Commission has learned that delays inherent in the registration process are diminishing or negating the usefulness
of emergency temporary and temporary motor carrier operating authorities. The proposed regulations provide expedited
registration procedures for carriers operating under such temporary authorities and establish concomitant enforcement
mechanisms for the participating States.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 In response to a petition jointly filed by motor carrier consulting companies Lee's Permit Service and Little Debby's
Tag Service (petitioners), the Commission is proposing to amend the Single State Registration System (SSRS) rules
it promulgated in Single State Insurance Registration, 9 I.C.C.2d 610 (1993). Petitioners have found that some States
participating in the SSRS take 2 to 3 weeks to process applications. Under the SSRS rules, carriers may not operate
lawfully in participating States without carrying copies of registration receipts in their vehicles. Petitioners
argue that the delay diminishes the usefulness of their temporary authorites. To address the situation, the Commission
is proposing regulations providing expedited registration procedures for carriers operating under temporary
authorities. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Commission invites interested parties to submit comments on the proposed rules. In addition, parties may address
the necessity and feasibility of modifying the current registration application form, appearing as appendix A to
49 CFR part 1023, in lieu of or in addition to adopting new rules. In this connection, parties may address the feasibility
of a carrier's maintaining in its vehicles a copy of a filed application and/or a filed notice. The Commission encourages
parties that are in agreement to submit joint filings. Parties adopting by reference the comments submitted by others
need not submit copies of the referenced material.

Initial Regulatory Flexibility Certification 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 605(b), we preliminarily conclude that our proposed action in this proceeding will not have a
significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. The purpose of our action is to enable motor
carriers that gain temporary operating authorities to be able immediately to use their authorities without fear
of incurring State fines. Compliance by carriers with a simple, expedited filing and copying requirement would result
in relief from the threat of State regulatory enforcement. The economic impact on small entities, if any, should be
positive but is not likely to be significant within the meaning of the Regulatory Flexibility Act. We invite parties
to comment on the issue of economic impact on small entities in order to assist us in making findings in this area.

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The FDIC, FRB, OCC, and OTS (the Agencies) are proposing revisions to their risk-based capital standards to address
the regulatory capital treatment of recourse arrangements and direct credit substitutes that expose banks, bank
holding companies, and thrifts to credit risk. The proposal is intended to correct certain inconsistencies in the
Agencies' risk-based capital standards and allow banks and bank holding companies (banking organizations) to maintain
lower amounts of capital against low-level recourse transactions. The proposal would require higher amounts of
risk-based capital to be maintained against certain direct credit substitutes, including, for banking organizations,
purchased servicing rights that provide loss protection to the owners of the loans serviced and purchased subordinated
interests that absorb the first dollars of losses from the underlying assets, and, for both banking organizations
and thrifts, certain guarantee-type arrangements (such as standby letters of credit) provided for third-party
assets that absorb the first dollars of losses from those assets.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The OTS is proposing to change only the capital requirements for the treatment of guarantee-type arrangements that
absorb first dollar losses. In all other respects, the OTS treatment of recourse and direct credit substitutes would
continue to follow existing OTS capital regulations. The OTS regulations have been revised for clarity and now include
language codifying agency regulatory guidance.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition, the Agencies are publishing, in an advance notice of proposed rulemaking (ANPR), a preliminary proposal
to use credit ratings to match the risk-based capital assessment more closely to an institution's relative risk of
loss in certain asset securitizations. The Agencies are also requesting comment in the ANPR on the need for a similar
system for unrated asset securitizations and on how such a system could be designed.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Agencies intend that any final rules adopted in connection with this notice of proposed rulemaking and ANPR that
result in increased risk-based capital requirements for banking organizations or thrifts would apply only to transactions
that are consummated after the effective date of such final rules.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=2 -->
A. Overview
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
Each of the Agencies is proposing to amend its risk-based capital standards to clarify and revise the treatment of
recourse arrangements and certain direct credit substitutes that expose banking organizations (banks and bank
holding companies) and thrifts to credit risk. The Banking Agencies (OCC, FRB, and FDIC) are also proposing to recommend
that the FFIEC make conforming revisions to the regulatory reporting requirements applicable to asset transfers
with recourse and direct credit substitutes for insured commercial banks and FDIC-supervised savings banks.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This notice of proposed rulemaking would amend the Agencies' risk-based capital standards to:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Define the term ``recourse'' and expand the definition of the term ``direct credit substitute'';

</FOOTNAME>
<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->
The OTS risk-based capital regulation already permits thrifts to hold reduced capital against low level recourse
transactions and requires thrifts to treat purchased recourse servicing and certain purchased subordinated interests
as recourse. 12 CFR 567.6(a)(2)(i)(C). The OTS is not proposing to amend these existing treatments.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
&bull;Require banking organizations that purchase loan servicing rights that provide loss protection to the owners
of the loans serviced to hold capital against those loans;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Require banking organizations that purchase subordinated interests in loans or pools of loans that absorb
the first dollars of losses from those loans to hold capital against the subordinated interest plus all more senior
interests; and
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Require banking organizations and thrifts that provide financial standby letters of credit or other guarantee-type
arrangements for third-party assets that absorb the first dollars of losses from those assets to hold the same amount
of capital that they would be required to hold under a recourse arrangement with equivalent risk exposure.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Agencies are also publishing as an advance notice of proposed rulemaking (ANPR) a preliminary ``multi-level
approach,'' that would use credit ratings from nationally recognized statistical rating organizations to measure
relative exposure to risk in rated securitized asset transactions and would allow the capital assessment to vary
with the risk. The Agencies are also requesting comment in the ANPR on the need for a separate multi-level approach
for unrated securitizations and on how such a system could be designed.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
B. Purpose and Effect
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Implementation of all aspects of this proposal, including one or more multi-level approaches for securitization
transactions, would result in more consistent treatments of recourse and similar transactions among the Agencies,
more consistent risk-based capital treatments for transactions involving similar risk, and capital requirements
that more closely reflect a banking organization or thrift's relative exposure to credit risk. In particular, the
proposed treatments of low-level recourse transactions, purchased loan servicing rights that provide loss protection,
and purchased subordinated interests that absorb the first dollars of losses from the underlying assets would bring
the capital requirements of the Banking Agencies into greater conformity with those of the OTS.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposal would allow banks and bank holding companies (banking organizations) to maintain lower amounts of capital
against low-level recourse transactions. The proposal would also require higher amounts of risk-based capital
to be maintained against certain direct credit substitutes, including, for banking organizations, purchased servicing
rights that provide loss protection to the owners of the loans serviced and purchased subordinated interests that
absorb the first dollars of losses from the underlying assets, and, for both banking organizations and thrifts, certain
guarantee-type arrangements provided for third-party assets that absorb the first dollars of losses from those
assets.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Additionally, the Agencies expect that a multi-level approach will provide a method for identifying participants
in securitization transactions that are relatively insulated from credit risk and therefore eligible for reduced
capital assessments.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Agencies intend that any final rules adopted in connection with this notice of proposed rulemaking and advance
notice of proposed rulemaking that result in increased risk-based capital requirements for banking organizations
or thrifts would apply only to transactions that are consummated after the effective date of such final rules. The
Agencies intend that any final rules adopted in connection with this notice that result in reduced risk-based capital
requirements for banking organizations or thrifts would apply to all transactions outstanding as of the effective
date of such final rules and to all subsequent transactions.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Agencies believe that the proposed rule would satisfy the requirements of section 618(b)(3) of the Resolution
Trust Corporation Refinancing, Restructuring, and Improvement Act, since the proposed rule would apply to multifamily
residential property loans sold with recourse.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
C. Background
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
1. Recourse and Direct Credit Substitutes
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Asset securitization is the process by which loans and other receivables are pooled, reconstituted into one or more
classes or positions, and then sold. Securitizations typically carve up the risk of credit losses from the underlying
assets and distribute it to different parties. The ``first dollar'' loss or subordinate position is first to absorb
credit losses, the ``senior'' investor position is last, and there may be one or more loss positions in between (``second
dollar'' loss positions). Each loss position functions as a credit enhancement for the more senior loss positions
in the structure.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For residential mortgages that are sold through the federally sponsored mortgage programs, a federal government
agency or federally sponsored agency guarantees the securities sold to investors. However, many of today's asset
securitization programs involve nonmortgage assets and are not supported in any way by the federal government. Sellers
of these privately securitized assets therefore provide other forms of credit enhancement_first and second dollar
loss positions_to reduce investors' risk of loss.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Sellers may provide this credit enhancement themselves through recourse arrangements. For purposes of this notice,
``recourse'' refers to any risk of loss that an institution may retain in connection with the transfer of its assets.
While banking organizations and thrifts have long provided recourse in connection with sales of whole loans or loan
participations, recourse arrangements today are frequently associated with asset securitization programs.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Sellers may also arrange for a third party to provide credit enhancement in an asset securitization. If the third-party
enhancement is provided by another banking organization or thrift, that institution assumes some portion of the
assets' credit risk. For purposes of this proposal, all forms of third-party enhancements, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
i.e., 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
all arrangements in which an institution assumes risk of loss from third-party assets or other claims that it has not
transferred, are referred to as ``direct credit substitutes.''
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
3
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 In economic terms, an institution's risk of loss from providing a direct credit substitute can be identical to its
risk of loss from transferring an asset with recourse.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

</FOOTNAME>
<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->
As used in this preamble, the terms ``credit enhancement'' and ``enhancement'' refer to both recourse arrangements
and direct credit substitutes.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
</FOOTNOTE>

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Depending upon the type of asset securitization, a portion of the total credit enhancement may also be provided internally,
as part of the securitization structure, through the use of spread accounts, overcollateralization, or other forms
of self-enhancement. Many asset securitizations use a combination of internal enhancement, recourse, and third-party
enhancement to protect investors from risk of loss.

2. Prior History
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
On June 29, 1990, the Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council (FFIEC) published a request for comment
on recourse arrangements. See 55 FR 26766 (June 29, 1990). The publication announced the Agencies' intent to review
the regulatory capital, reporting and lending limit treatments of assets transferred with recourse and similar
transactions, and set out a broad range of issues for public comment. The FFIEC received approximately 150 comment
letters in response. The FFIEC then narrowed the scope of the review to the reporting and capital treatments of recourse
arrangements and direct credit substitutes that expose banking organizations and thrifts to credit-related risks.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In July 1992, after receiving preliminary recommendations from an interagency staff working group, the FFIEC directed
the staff to carry out a study of the likely impact of those recommendations on banking organizations and thrifts,
financial markets and other affected parties. As part of that study, the staff held a series of meetings with representatives
from thirteen organizations active in the securitization and credit enhancement markets. Summaries of the information
provided to the staff and a copy of the staff's letter sent to participants prior to the meetings are in the FFIEC's public
file on recourse arrangements and are available for public inspection and photocopying. Additional material provided
to the Agencies from financial institutions and others since these meetings has also been placed in the FFIEC's public
file. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FFIEC's offices are located at 2100 Pennsylvania Avenue, NW., suite 200, Washington, DC 20037. For public convenience,
the Agencies have also placed copies of all of the above material in the FRB's public file, located at 20th Street and
Constitution Avenue, NW., Washington, DC 20551, room B&hyph;1122.

D. Current Risk-Based Capital Treatments of Recourse and Direct Credit Substitutes 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Currently, the Agencies' risk-based capital standards apply different treatments to recourse arrangements and
direct credit substitutes. As a result, capital requirements applicable to credit enhancements do not consistently
reflect credit risk. The Banking Agencies' current rules are also not consistent with those of the OTS. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

Banking agencies.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Banking Agencies' risk-based capital guidelines prescribe a single treatment for assets transferred with recourse
whether the transaction is reported as a financing or a sale of assets in a bank's Consolidated Reports of Condition
and Income (Call Report). In either case, risk-based capital is held against the full, risk-weighted amount of the
transferred assets, regardless of the amount of recourse that is provided.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

</FOOTNAME>
<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->
The Banking Agencies provide a limited exception to this treatment for sales of mortgage loan pools where the bank
or bank holding company retains only minimal risk and meets certain other conditions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
</FOOTNOTE>

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Assets transferred with any amount of recourse in transactions reported as financings remain on the balance sheet
and continue to be subject to the full risk-based capital charge (based on their risk-weight). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Assets transferred with recourse in transactions that are reported as sales create off-balance sheet exposures.
The entire outstanding amount of the assets sold (not just the amount of the recourse) is converted into an on-balance
sheet credit equivalent amount using a 100% credit conversion factor. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This capital treatment differs from the accounting treatment for recourse arrangements under generally accepted
accounting principles (GAAP) and is intended to ensure that banking organizations that transfer assets and retain
the credit risk inherent in the assets maintain adequate capital to support that risk. As is explained below, the Banking
Agencies believe that the GAAP accounting treatment would not provide sufficient capital to support recourse arrangements.

b. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
OTS
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. OTS follows GAAP in according sales treatment to sales with recourse for reporting purposes and for calculating
the leverage ratios of thrifts. Under the OTS risk-based capital regulation, thrifts must also hold capital against
the full value of assets transferred with recourse in computing their risk-based capital requirements, unless the
capital charge would exceed the contractual maximum amount of the recourse provided. If the capital charge would
exceed the amount of the recourse, then the thrift is only required to hold dollar-for-dollar capital against the
contractual maximum amount of the recourse (the low-level recourse rule). (Footnote 17 below addresses the treatment
of recourse liability accounts.)

2. Direct Credit Substitutes

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Banking agencies.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Direct credit substitutes are treated differently from recourse under the current risk-based capital standards.
Under the Banking Agencies' guidelines, off-balance sheet direct credit substitutes, such as financial standby
letters of credit provided for third-party assets, carry a 100% credit conversion factor. However, only the dollar
amount of the direct credit substitute is converted into an on-balance sheet credit equivalent so that capital is
held only against the face amount of the direct credit substitute. The capital requirement for a recourse arrangement,
in contrast, is based on the full amount of the assets enhanced. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If a direct credit substitute covers less than 100% of the losses on the assets enhanced, the current capital treatment
results in a lower capital charge for a direct credit substitute than for a comparable recourse arrangement. For example,
if a direct credit substitute covers losses up to 20% of the amount of the assets enhanced, then the on-balance sheet
credit equivalent amount equals that 20% amount. Risk-based capital is held against only the 20% amount. In contrast,
required capital for a 20% recourse arrangement is higher because capital is held against the full outstanding amount
of the assets enhanced.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

</FOOTNAME>
<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->
If the direct credit substitute covers 100% of losses on the assets enhanced, then the current capital treatment results
in the same capital charge for a direct credit substitute as for an asset sold with recourse. The direct credit substitute
is converted into an on-balance sheet credit equivalent equal to 100% of the assets enhanced and capital is required
against that amount. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
</FOOTNOTE>

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Under the Agencies' proposal, the definition of direct credit substitute would also be expanded to include some items
that are already partially reflected on the balance sheet, such as purchased subordinated interests. Currently,
under the Banking Agencies' guidelines, these interests receive the same capital treatment as off-balance sheet
direct credit substitutes. Purchased subordinated interests are placed in the appropriate risk-weight category
and then added to the banking organization's risk-weighted assets. In contrast, if a banking organization retains
a subordinated interest in connection with the transfer of its own assets, this is considered recourse. The institution
must hold capital against the carrying amount of the subordinated interest as well as the outstanding amount of all
senior interests that it supports.

OTS.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The OTS risk-based capital regulation treats some forms of direct credit substitutes (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
e.g.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, financial standby letters of credit) the same as the Banking Agencies' guidelines. However, unlike the Banking
Agencies, the OTS treats purchased subordinated interests under its general recourse provisions (except for certain
high quality subordinated mortgage-related securities). The risk-based capital requirement is based on the carrying
amount of the subordinated interest plus all senior interests, as though the thrift owned the full outstanding amount
of the assets enhanced.

3. Problems With Existing Risk-Based Capital Treatments of Recourse Arrangements and Direct Credit Substitutes
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Agencies are proposing changes to the risk-based capital standards to address the following major concerns with
the current treatments of recourse and direct credit substitutes: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Different amounts of capital can be required for recourse arrangements and direct credit substitutes that
expose a banking organization or thrift to equivalent risk of loss. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;The standards generally do not reduce the capital requirement for banking organizations that reduce their
risk by transferring assets with low levels of recourse. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;The capital assessment rate does not recognize the difference in risk of loss between recourse or direct credit
substitutes that absorb first losses and recourse or direct credit substitutes that absorb second losses from the
underlying assets. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;The current standards do not provide uniform definitions of recourse, direct credit substitute, and associated
terms.

As was mentioned above, the Banking Agencies' regulatory capital treatment of asset transfers with recourse differs
from the accounting treatment of asset transfers with recourse under generally accepted accounting principles
(GAAP).
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Banking Agencies do not believe it would be appropriate to conform the regulatory capital treatment of recourse
arrangements to GAAP.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->
The OTS requires thrifts to account for assets sold with recourse in accordance with GAAP for reporting purposes and
leverage capital requirements, but assesses capital against assets sold with recourse in computing the risk-based
capital requirement for thrifts. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
</FOOTNOTE>

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Under GAAP, a transfer of receivables with recourse is accounted for as a sale if the transferor (1) surrenders control
of the future economic benefits of the assets, (2) is able to reasonably estimate its obligations under the recourse
provision, and (3) is not obligated to repurchase the assets except pursuant to the recourse provision. These provisions
indicate that GAAP focuses on the transfer of benefits rather than the retention of risk in determining whether an
asset transfer should be accounted for as a sale. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The transferor must accrue, as a separate liability, an amount sufficient to absorb all estimated probable losses
under the recourse provision over the life of the assets transferred. This accrued amount is referred to as the GAAP
recourse liability. If a banking organization reported assets transferred with recourse in accordance with GAAP,
and no regulatory capital were required for the transaction, then the institution's only protection against losses
would be the GAAP recourse liability account. For a number of reasons, the Banking Agencies are of the opinion that
the GAAP recourse liability account would be an inadequate substitute for an appropriate level of regulatory capital.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
First, the GAAP recourse liability account is intended to cover only an institution's probable expected losses under
the recourse provision. In contrast, regulatory capital is intended to provide a cushion against unexpected losses.
In recognition of the distinctly different purposes of the GAAP recourse liability account and regulatory capital,
the Banking Agencies explicitly exclude the GAAP recourse liability account from regulatory capital. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Second, the amount of credit risk that is typically retained in a recourse transaction greatly exceeds the normal,
expected losses associated with the transferred assets. Even though a transferor may reduce its exposure to potential
catastrophic losses by limiting the amount of recourse it provides, in many cases the transferor still retains the
bulk of the risk inherent in the assets. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For example, if an institution transfers high quality assets with 10% recourse that have a reasonably estimated loss
rate of 1%, the transferor retains the risk of default up to a maximum of 10% of the total amount of the assets transferred.
Because the recourse provision represents exposure to such a high amount of losses relative to the expected losses,
in the normal course of business the transferor will sustain the same amount of losses as if the assets had not been sold.
Consequently, the Banking Agencies take the position that the transferor in this example has not significantly reduced
its risk for purposes of assessing regulatory capital and should continue to be assessed regulatory capital as though
the assets have not been transferred. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Third, the GAAP reliance on reasonable estimates of all probable credit losses over the life of the receivables transferred
poses additional concerns for the Banking Agencies. While it may be possible to make such estimates for pools of consumer
loans or residential mortgages, the Banking Agencies are of the view that it is difficult to do so for other types of
loans. Even if it is possible to make a reasonable estimate of probable credit losses at the time an asset or asset pool
is transferred, the ability of an institution to make a reasonable estimate may change over the life of the transferred
assets. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Finally, the Banking Agencies are concerned that an institution transferring assets with recourse might estimate
that it would not have any losses under the recourse provision, in which case it would not establish any GAAP recourse
liability account for the exposure. If the transferor recorded either no liability or only a nominal liability in
the GAAP recourse liability account for a succession of asset transfers, a cumulation of credit risk would occur that
would not be reflected, or would be only partially reflected, on the balance sheet.

The Agencies' proposal to amend the risk-based capital standards would do the following: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Define the term ``recourse,'' expand the definition of the existing term ``direct credit substitute,'' and
define the associated terms ``standard representations and warranties'' and ``servicer cash advance''; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Reduce the Banking Agencies' risk-based capital assessment for certain low-level recourse arrangements;
and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Require equivalent treatment of recourse arrangements and certain direct credit substitutes that present
equivalent risk of loss, including

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
1. Recourse 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposal defines ``recourse'' to mean any risk of loss that a banking organization or thrift 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
retains
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 in connection with an asset transfer, if the risk of loss exceeds a pro rata share of the institution's claim on the assets.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
8
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The proposed definition of recourse is consistent with the Banking Agencies' longstanding use of this term, and is
intended to incorporate into the risk-based capital standards existing Agency practices regarding retention of
risk in asset transfers.

If the institution transfers an asset or pool of assets in whole or in part but shares the total credit risk from the assets
on a pro rata basis with the purchaser, this is not considered recourse. In such transactions, capital is required
only against the transferor's pro rata share. Recourse exists when the transferor retains a disproportionate amount
of the credit risk relative to its retained interest (if any) in the assets.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->
The OTS currently defines the term ``recourse'' more broadly than the proposal to include credit risk that a thrift
assumes or accepts from third-party assets as well as risk that it retains in an asset transfer. Under the proposal,
as explained below, credit risk that a banking organization or thrift assumes from third-party assets would fall
under the definition of ``direct credit substitute'' rather than ``recourse.''

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Currently, the term ``recourse'' is not explicitly defined in the Banking Agencies' risk-based capital guidelines.
Instead, the guidelines use the term ``sale of assets with recourse,'' which is defined by reference to the Call Report
instructions. See Call Report instructions, Glossary (entry for ``Sales of Assets''). Once a definition of recourse
is adopted in the risk-based capital guidelines, the Banking Agencies would delete the cross-reference to the Call
Report instructions and would recommend to the FFIEC that these instructions be revised to incorporate the risk-based
capital definition of recourse. The OTS capital regulation currently provides a definition of the term ``recourse,''
which would also be replaced once a final definition of recourse is adopted. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
2. Direct Credit Substitute 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposed definition of ``direct credit substitute'' is intended to mirror the definition of recourse. The term
``direct credit substitute'' would refer to any arrangement in which an institution 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
assumes 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
risk of loss from assets or other claims it has not transferred, if the risk of loss exceeds the institution's pro rata
share of the assets or other claims. Currently, under the Banking Agencies' guidelines, this term covers guarantees
and guarantee-type arrangements. As revised, it would also explicitly include items such as purchased subordinated
interests and agreements to cover credit losses that arise from purchased loan servicing rights. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
3. Risks Other Than Credit Risks 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
These definitions cover arrangements that create exposure to all types of risk. However, a capital charge would be
assessed only against arrangements that create exposure to credit or credit-related risks. This continues the Agencies'
current practice and is consistent with the risk-based capital standards' current, primary focus on credit risk.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
4. Implicit Recourse 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The definitions cover all arrangements that are recourse or direct credit substitutes, in form or in substance. This
continues the Banking Agencies' current treatment of recourse under the Call Report instructions.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
10
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Recourse exists in substance, or implicitly, when an institution demonstrates a pattern of providing recourse even
though it has no legal obligation to do so. For example, an institution that regularly buys back or replaces problem
assets when it is not required to do so under the terms of the sale agreement may be providing recourse. The Agencies
will continue their current practice of requiring institutions that demonstrate a pattern of providing implicit
recourse to treat those transactions and all similar outstanding transactions as recourse for risk-based capital
purposes. The Agencies will follow the same approach, as appropriate, for direct credit substitutes. Decisions
concerning implicit recourse or implicit direct credit substitute arrangements will be made on a case-by-case basis.

5. Subordinated Interests in Loans or Pools of Loans 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The definitions explicitly cover an institution's ownership of subordinated interests in loans or pools of loans.
This continues the Banking Agencies' longstanding treatment of retained subordinated interests as recourse and
recognizes that purchased subordinated interests can also function as credit enhancements. Subordinated interests
generally absorb more than their pro rata share of losses (principal or interest) from the underlying assets in the
event of default.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
11
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 For example, a multi-class asset securitization may have several classes of subordinated securities, each of which
provides credit enhancement for the more senior classes. Generally, the holder of any class that absorbs more than
its pro rata share of losses from the total underlying assets is providing recourse or a direct credit substitute for
all more senior classes.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->
A class of securities that receives payments of principal (and, in some cases, interest) only after another class
or classes from the same issue is completely paid is generally not considered recourse or a credit substitute, provided
that losses are shared on a pro rata basis in the event of default.

6. Second Mortgages 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Second mortgages or home equity loans would generally not be considered recourse or direct credit substitutes, unless
they actually functioned as credit enhancements by facilitating the sale of the first mortgage. This is most likely
to occur if a lender originates first and second mortgages contemporaneously on the same property and then sells the
first mortgage and retains the second. In such a transaction, the second mortgage would function as a substitute for
a recourse arrangement because it is intended that the second mortgage will absorb losses before the first mortgage
does if the borrower fails to make all payments due on both loans. Under the proposal, a second mortgage that is originated
at or about the same time as the first mortgage would be presumed to be a recourse arrangement or direct credit substitute
unless the holder was able to demonstrate that the second mortgage was granted for some purpose other than providing
credit enhancement for the first mortgage (e.g., home improvement loans).

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
(Question 1) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Agencies specifically request comment on this proposed treatment and on whether additional factors should be
considered in determining whether a second mortgage provides recourse or a direct credit substitute. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
7. Representations and Warranties 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
When a banking organization or thrift transfers assets, including servicing rights, it customarily makes representations
and warranties concerning those assets. When a banking organization or thrift purchases loan servicing rights,
it may also assume representations and warranties made by the seller or a prior servicer. These representations and
warranties give certain rights to other parties and impose obligations upon the seller or servicer of the assets.
The definitions would treat as recourse or direct credit substitutes any representations or warranties that create
exposure to default risk or any other form of open-ended, credit-related risk from the assets that is not controllable
by the seller or servicer. This reflects the Agencies' current practice with respect to recourse arising out of representations
and warranties, and explicitly recognizes that a servicer with purchased loan servicing rights can also take on risk
through servicer representations and warranties. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Agencies recognize, however, that the market requires asset transferors and servicers to make certain representations
and warranties, and that most of these present only normal, operational risk. Currently, the Agencies have no formal
standard for distinguishing between these types of representations and warranties and those that create recourse
or direct credit substitutes. The proposal therefore defines the term ``standard representations and warranties''
and provides that seller or servicer representations or warranties that meet this definition would not be considered
recourse or direct credit substitutes.

<TEXT>
 
<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Under the proposal, ``standard representations and warranties'' are those that refer to an existing state of facts
that the seller or servicer can either control or verify with reasonable due diligence at the time the assets are sold
or the servicing rights are transferred. These representations and warranties will not be considered recourse or
direct credit substitutes, provided that the seller or servicer performs due diligence prior to the transfer of the
assets or servicing rights to ensure that it has a reasonable basis for making the representation or warranty. The
term ``standard representations and warranties'' would also cover contractual provisions that permit the return
of transferred assets in the event of fraud or documentation deficiencies, (i.e., if the assets are not what the seller
represented them to be), consistent with the current Call Report instructions governing the reporting of asset transfers.
After a final definition of ``standard representations and warranties'' is adopted for the risk-based capital standards,
the Banking Agencies would recommend to the FFIEC that the Call Report instructions be changed to conform to the capital
guidelines and the OTS would similarly amend the instructions for the Thrift Financial Report (TFR). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Examples of ``standard representations and warranties'' include seller representations that the transferred
assets are current (i.e., not past due) at the time of sale; that the assets meet specific, agreed-upon credit standards
at the time of sale; or that the assets are free and clear of any liens (provided that the seller has exercised due diligence
to verify these facts). An example of a nonstandard representation and warranty would be a contractual provision
stating that all properties underlying a pool of transferred mortgages are free of environmental hazards. This representation
is not verifiable by the seller or servicer with reasonable due diligence because it is not possible to absolutely
verify that a property is, in fact, free of all environmental hazards. Such an open-ended guarantee against the risk
that unknown but currently existing hazards might be discovered in the future would be considered recourse or a direct
credit substitute. However, a seller's representation that all properties underlying a pool of transferred mortgages
have undergone environmental studies and that the studies revealed no known environmental hazards would be a ``standard
representation and warranty'' (assuming that the seller performed the requisite due diligence). This is a verifiable
statement of facts that would not be considered recourse or a direct credit substitute.

8. Loan Servicing Arrangements 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The definitions cover loan servicing arrangements if the servicer is responsible for credit losses associated with
the loans being serviced. However, cash advances made by servicers to ensure an uninterrupted flow of payments to
investors or the timely collection of the loans would be specifically excluded from the definitions of recourse and
direct credit substitute, provided that the servicer is entitled to reimbursement for any significant advances.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
13
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Such advances are assessed risk-based capital only against the amount of the cash advance, and are assigned to the
risk-weight category appropriate to the party that is obligated to reimburse the servicer. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->
Servicer cash advances would include disbursements made to cover foreclosure costs or other expenses arising from
a loan in order to facilitate its timely collection (but not to protect investors from incurring these expenses).

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
</FOOTNOTE>

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
If the servicer is not entitled to full reimbursement, then the maximum possible amount of any nonreimbursed advances
on any one loan must be contractually limited to an insignificant amount of the outstanding principal on that loan
in order for the cash advance to be excluded from the definitions of recourse and direct credit substitute. This treatment
reflects the Agencies' traditional view that servicer cash advances meeting these criteria are part of the normal
servicing function and do not constitute credit enhancements.

B. Low-level recourse rule 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Banking Agencies are proposing to reduce the capital requirement for all recourse transactions in which a banking
organization contractually limits its exposure to less than the full, effective risk-based capital requirement
for the assets transferred (referred to as ``low-level recourse transactions'').
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
14
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 This proposal would apply to low-level recourse transactions involving all types of assets, including small business
loans, commercial loans and residential mortgages.

1. ``Dollar-for-dollar'' Capital Requirement Up to the Amount of the Recourse Obligation for Low-Level Recourse

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Under the proposed low-level recourse rule, a banking organization that contractually limits its maximum recourse
obligation to less than the full effective risk-based capital requirement for the transferred assets would be required
to hold risk-based capital equal to the contractual maximum amount of its recourse obligation. This would be a ``dollar-for-dollar''
capital requirement for the low-level recourse exposure. For example, the risk-based capital requirement for a
100% risk-weighted asset transferred with 3% recourse would be only 3% of the value of the transferred assets rather
than the currently required 8%. This would prevent a banking organization's capital requirement from exceeding
the contractual maximum amount that it could lose under a recourse obligation.

applies the low-level recourse rule to thrifts.

The proposed low-level recourse rule would supersede the Banking Agencies' current risk-based capital treatment
of mortgage transfers with ``insignificant'' recourse. Under that treatment, the sale of a residential mortgage
with recourse is excluded from risk-weighted assets if the institution does not retain significant risk of loss,
i.e., the institution's maximum contractual recourse exposure does not exceed its reasonably estimated probable
losses on the transferred mortgages, and the institution establishes and maintains a recourse liability account
equal to the amount of its recourse obligation.

The Agencies will continue to evaluate the need for full capital support for low-level recourse transactions and
will consider, in connection with development of the multi-level approaches that are discussed in Section III, whether
even greater reductions in the capital requirement for low-level recourse transactions should be proposed.

2. Low-level Recourse Arrangements for Mortgage-Related Securities or Participation Certificates Retained in
a Mortgage Loan Swap 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
When an institution swaps mortgage loans for mortgage-related securities or participation certificates and retains
low-level recourse, the Banking Agencies currently base the capital requirement on the underlying loans as if the
loans were held as on-balance sheet assets. The OTS bases the capital requirement for these arrangements on its existing
low-level recourse rule, with a minimum capital level of 1.6% of the mortgage-related securities or participation
certificates. (These certificates would include only high-quality mortgage related securities.)

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
To recognize the risks related to such a participation certificate and the retained recourse, the Agencies propose
to change their capital requirement for this arrangement. The requirement would equal the sum of the amount of risk-based
capital required for the portion of the mortgage-related security or participation certificate not covered by the
institution's recourse obligation and the risk-based capital required for the low-level recourse obligation retained
on the underlying loans, limited to the capital requirement for the underlying loans as if the loans were held as on-balance
sheet assets. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For example, if an institution swaps $1,000 of qualifying single-family mortgage loans for a Freddie Mac participation
certificate and retains 1% recourse, the proposed capital requirement would equal the sum of the following: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=16 g=1 f=1 -->
(1) $1,000 times (100% minus 1%)
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=16 g=5 f=1 -->
16
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=16 g=1 f=1 -->
 times 20% risk-weight times 8% = $15.84, and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<FOOTNOTE>
<FOOTNAME>
<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=5 f=1 -->
16
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

</FOOTNAME>
<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->
This 99% piece is the portion of the loan pool not covered by the institution's recourse obligation, which is guaranteed
by Freddie Mac. For operational simplicity, 100% may be used to determine an institution's capital requirement.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
</FOOTNOTE>

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=16 g=1 f=1 -->
(2) $1,000 times 1% = $10 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 02 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
This sum, $25.84, is limited by the capital requirement on the underlying loans as if they were held by the institution.
This limit is 4% of $1,000 or $40. Thus, since the sum, $25.84, is less than the limit, $40, the capital requirement is
$25.84.

3. Reporting of Low-Level Recourse Transactions 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Banking Agencies are also proposing to recommend to the FFIEC that banks be permitted to report low-level recourse
transactions as sales of assets (rather than financings) in the Call Report, if they establish and maintain a recourse
liability account for the contractual maximum amount of the recourse obligation. (Otherwise, these transactions
would continue to be reported as financings in the Call Report.) The recourse liability account could be established
either by a charge to expense or to the allowance for loan and lease losses, as appropriate. The recourse liability
account would not be part of the allowance for loan and lease losses and would therefore be excluded from the bank's
capital base. Banks that fully reserve against their recourse exposure in this manner would not be assessed any risk-based
capital for the transaction, which would be consistent with the current treatment of such transactions for thrifts.
The accounting entries which permit the removal of the assets from a bank's balance sheet on the condition that the
low-level risk exposures are either expensed or fully reserved for (either of which produces a change in the bank's
equity capital position) result in an appropriately adjusted leverage capital ratio. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Banking Agencies currently permit banks to report as sales in the Call Report certain residential and agricultural
mortgage transfers with recourse that qualify as sales under GAAP. The FRB requires bank holding companies to report
all asset sales with recourse in accordance with GAAP on the consolidated financial statement for bank holding companies
(Form FR Y&hyph;9C). The OTS requires thrifts to report all transfers of receivables with recourse in accordance
with GAAP on their TFRs. The Agencies are not proposing to change these existing regulatory reporting treatments.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
4. GAAP Recourse Liability Account 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As previously explained, under GAAP, when a transfer of receivables with recourse qualifies to be recognized as a
sale, the seller must establish a recourse liability account at the date of sale that covers all probable credit losses
under the recourse provision over the life of the receivables transferred. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
(Question 2)
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Banking Agencies request comment on how the GAAP recourse liability account should be treated under the proposed
low-level recourse rule for transfers of receivables with recourse that are currently reported as sales in the Call
Report and FR Y&hyph;9C.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
17
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 That is, when a banking organization transfers assets in such transactions, should the amount of capital required
under the low-level recourse rule be adjusted to take account of the institution's GAAP recourse liability account?

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<FOOTNOTE>
<FOOTNAME>

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=5 f=1 -->
17
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

</FOOTNAME>
<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->
The OTS is not proposing to change its current policy, which permits a thrift to deduct the amount of its GAAP recourse
liability account (1) from the contractual maximum amount of its recourse obligation in applying the low-level recourse
rule, and (2) from the amount of loans sold with recourse in assessing the full effective risk-based capital requirement
for all loans. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
</FOOTNOTE>

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The two options are: (1) Not taking the GAAP recourse liability account into consideration at all; or (2) requiring
risk-based capital equal to the amount of the banking organization's low-level recourse obligation minus the balance
of its GAAP recourse liability account so that the recourse liability account plus required capital would equal the
banking organization's contractual maximum exposure under the recourse obligation.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
18
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The latter option would conform the Banking Agencies' treatment to that of the OTS in this area.

The GAAP recourse liability account must be excluded from an institution's risk-based and leverage capital base.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
</FOOTNOTE>

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Banking Agencies' existing risk-based capital guidelines also do not indicate how the GAAP recourse liability
account should be taken into account in general when determining the credit equivalent amounts of assets transferred
with recourse that are currently reported as sales in the Call Report or FR Y&hyph;9C. The Banking Agencies expect
to apply the GAAP recourse liability account treatment that they adopt for low-level recourse transactions that
are reported as sales in the Call Report or FR Y&hyph;9C to all asset transfers with recourse that are currently reported
as sales in the Call Report or FR Y&hyph;9C, and to clarify their risk-based capital guidelines accordingly.

C. Treatment of Direct Credit Substitutes 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Agencies are proposing to extend the current risk-based capital treatment of asset transfers with recourse (including
the proposed low-level recourse rule) to certain direct credit substitutes. As previously explained, the current
risk-based capital assessment for a direct credit substitute may be dramatically lower than the assessment for a
recourse provision that creates an identical exposure to risk. Based on the Agencies' conclusion that asset transfers
with recourse should be assessed risk-based capital against the full amount of the assets enhanced
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
19
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (except in low-level recourse transactions), the Agencies are of the opinion that direct credit substitutes that
present equivalent risk should be subject to an equivalent risk-based capital treatment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
</FOOTNOTE>

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Under this proposal, the general treatment of direct credit substitutes would be to assess capital against the amount
of the asset or pool of assets that is enhanced, rather than the face amount of the direct credit substitute. Like low-level
recourse arrangements, direct credit substitutes that cover only losses below the full effective risk-based capital
requirement for the assets would be assessed a dollar-for-dollar capital requirement.

</FOOTNAME>
<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->
As indicated in Section II(B), the Agencies are continuing to evaluate the need for a dollar-for-dollar capital requirement
on low-level recourse transactions. Any modification to the proposed treatment of low level recourse transactions
would also apply to low level direct credit substitutes (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 -->
i.e.,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->
 those that cover losses below the full, effective risk-based capital charge for the total outstanding amount of the
assets enhanced). See Section III for additional discussion. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
</FOOTNOTE>

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposed treatment of direct credit substitutes would not affect the current treatment of purchased subordinated
interests and financial standby letters of credit that absorb only the second dollars of losses from the assets enhanced.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
21
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Agencies intend to determine the appropriate risk-based capital treatment of these second dollar loss direct
credit substitutes as part of the development of the multi-level approaches discussed in Section III. In the event
that the Agencies do not proceed with implementation of one or more multi-level approaches, the Agencies would expect
to propose amendments to the risk-based capital standards that would assess risk-based capital against all second
dollar loss direct credit substitutes based on their face amounts plus the face amounts of all more senior outstanding
positions.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->
For purposes of this proposal, and until the Agencies implement one or more multi-level approaches, a direct credit
substitute absorbs the second dollars of losses from assets if there is prior credit enhancement that absorbs first
dollars of losses from those assets. For OTS only, purchased subordinated interests whether in the first or second
loss position will continue to be treated as recourse.

Each of these is discussed below. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
1. Purchased Loan Servicing Rights That Embody a Direct Credit Substitute 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Banking organizations and thrifts that sell receivables often retain the servicing rights on the transferred assets.
Banking organizations and thrifts may also acquire loan servicing rights as separate assets such as purchased mortgage
servicing rights. The terms of some loan servicing agreements require the servicer to absorb credit losses on the
loans, so that the servicer effectively extends a credit enhancement (in the form of recourse or a direct credit substitute)
to the owners of the loans. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Currently, all of the Agencies treat as recourse retained loan servicing rights that embody an obligation to provide
credit or other loss protection to the owners of the loans. Accordingly, risk-based capital is required against the
full amount of the assets serviced. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under the Banking Agencies' proposal, banking organizations with purchased loan servicing rights that extend credit
protection (a direct credit substitute) to the owners of the loans being serviced would also be required to hold capital
against the total outstanding amount of those loans.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
22
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Thus, banking organizations that purchase such servicing rights would be required to apply the 100% credit conversion
factor to the amount of assets enhanced (the amount of the loans serviced) to convert this off-balance sheet exposure
into an on-balance sheet credit equivalent amount.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

</FOOTNAME>
<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->
The risk-based capital requirement for the servicer's exposure to credit risk from the loans would be in addition
to the separate risk-based capital requirement that is currently required to support qualifying intangible assets
under the risk-based capital standards. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
</FOOTNOTE>

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposed low-level recourse rule would apply if the servicer's maximum retained recourse obligation is contractually
limited to an amount that is less than the amount of capital that would be required against the total amount of the loans
serviced. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
(Question 3) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Agencies request comment on whether purchased loan servicing rights agreements exist that obligate the servicer
to provide credit loss protection for only the second dollars of losses from the loans. In determining a servicer's
loss position, the Agencies do not consider access to loan collateral upon default to place the servicer in a second
loss position. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Adoption of the proposal would align the Banking Agencies' treatment of purchased loan servicing rights that embody
a direct credit substitute with that of the OTS, which already explicitly requires capital support for these arrangements.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
24
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Currently, the FDIC and OCC do not explicitly require capital support for these arrangements.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
25
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (Capital is required for the allowed portion of the intangible asset generated by the purchase of mortgage servicing
rights, but not for the servicer's separate risk of loss on the underlying loans). The FRB considers purchased mortgage
servicing rights that provide credit protection to be a direct credit substitute and requires capital support for
the risk associated with the underlying mortgage loans. Thus, the proposal would make this treatment explicit in
the FRB's guidelines.

2. Purchased Subordinated Interests 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposal would extend the current risk-based capital treatment of retained subordinated interests to purchased
subordinated interests that absorb the first dollars of losses from the underlying loans or loan pools. Currently,
banking organizations with purchased subordinated interests are required to hold risk-based capital only against
the carrying value of the subordinated interest. In contrast, the OTS currently treats purchased subordinated interests
in the same manner as retained subordinated interests, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
i.e.,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 as recourse, except for certain high quality subordinated interests.

The OTS will continue to recognize the 20 percent risk-weight for high quality residential mortgage-backed senior

3(a)(41) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, 15 U.S.C. 78c(a)(41), except as discussed in Regulatory Bulletin
26. These types of securities are commonly referred to as ``SMMEA securities.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
</FOOTNOTE>

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Under this proposal, banking organizations with direct credit substitutes in the form of purchased subordinated
interests that absorb the first dollars of losses from the underlying assets would be required to hold risk-based
capital against the carrying value of the subordinated interest plus the outstanding amount of all more senior interests
that the subordinated interest supports.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
27
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 If the carrying value of the most subordinated portion of the loan, or pool of loans, is less than the full, effective
risk-based capital requirement for the total underlying loan, or pool of loans, then the low-level treatment would
apply, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
i.e.,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 the subordinated portion would be assessed risk-based capital dollar-for-dollar against its carrying value. For
example, if the most subordinated portion of a pool of mortgage assets that qualifies for the 50% risk-weight is held
by a banking organization and its carrying value represents only 3% of the total pool, the capital requirement for
the subordinated portion would be 3% of the total pool rather than 4% (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
i.e.,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 the carrying value of the subordinated portion rather than the full effective capital requirement for the pool).

3. Financial Standby Letters of Credit and Guarantee-Like Arrangements 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposal would extend the risk-based capital treatment that is currently applied to asset transfers with recourse
to financial standby letters of credit and guarantee-like arrangements that absorb the first dollars of losses from
third-party assets. The risk-based capital assessment for this form of credit enhancement would be based on the full
amount of the assets enhanced rather than the face amount of the standby letter of credit or guarantee-like arrangement.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The risk-based capital treatment of standby letters of credit or guarantee-like arrangements that represent second
dollar loss enhancements provided for third-party assets would not be affected by this proposal. For purposes of
this part of the proposal, a second dollar loss standby letter of credit or guarantee-like arrangement is one that
covers any percentage portion of loss after some level of the first dollars of loss is covered by another party or through
internal enhancement (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
e.g.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, losses from 6 to 20% of the asset value when another party provides first dollar loss enhancement that covers losses
from 0 to 6% of the asset value
<FOOTCITE>29</FOOTCITE>
). These second dollar loss direct credit substitutes would continue to be assessed risk-based capital based on their
risk-weighted face amounts. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<FOOTNOTE>
<FOOTNAME>
<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->
29
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

</FOOTNAME>
<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->
If the enhancement is a back-up for the 0 to 6% coverage (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 -->
i.e.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->
, the first party covers the first 6% of losses and the second party covers the first 20% of losses but expects to absorb
losses at the 0 to 6% level only if the first party fails to perform), then this is not a ``second dollar loss'' enhancement.
The second party has exposure to the risk that the first party will not perform and would be charged capital for that
exposure at the risk-weight appropriate for claims against the first party. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
</FOOTNOTE>

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposed rule also addresses participations in financial standby letters of credit and guarantee-like arrangements.

D. Summary 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposal would increase capital requirements for first dollar loss financial standby letters of credit and guarantee-like
arrangements that cover less than 100% of the face value of the total assets enhanced. There would be no change, however,
in the risk-based capital requirement for arrangements that cover the entire amount of losses from a third party's
assets, because the current guidelines already require capital to be held against the full asset amount in such direct
credit substitute transactions. Based on Agency staff discussions with market participants, the Agencies believe
that the majority of first dollar loss financial standby letters of credit and similar arrangements that are provided
by banking organizations and thrifts in the current market are of this latter type. Thus, the Agencies do not expect
that many banking organizations or thrifts would face increased risk-based capital requirements as a result of this
aspect of the proposal. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Moreover, as was previously mentioned, the Agencies are considering options for matching the risk-based capital
requirement more closely to the risk associated with second dollar loss subordinated interests and financial standby
letters of credit and guarantee-like arrangements in connection with the development of one or more multi-level
approaches. The multi-level approaches, in conjunction with the proposed rules above, would ensure that banking
organizations maintain adequate capital against the risks associated with credit enhancements, would recognize
when an institution has reduced its risk, and make capital treatment more consistent across the various types of depository
institutions.

III. Advance Notice of Proposed Rulemaking 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Many asset securitizations carve up the risk of credit losses from the underlying assets and distribute it to different
parties. The first dollar loss or subordinate position is first to absorb credit losses, the senior investor position
is last, and there may be one or more loss positions in between. Each loss position functions as a credit enhancement
for the more senior loss positions in the structure. Currently, the risk-based capital standards do not vary the rate
of capital assessment with differences in credit risk represented by different credit enhancement or loss positions.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
To address this issue, the Agencies are requesting comment on a preliminary proposal to adopt a multi-level approach
that would assess risk-based capital against all banking organization and thrift participants in certain asset
securitizations (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
i.e.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, recourse providers, direct credit substitute providers and investors) based on their relative exposure to risk
of loss from the underlying assets. Credit ratings from nationally recognized statistical rating organizations
would be used to determine relative exposure to risk of loss. This proposal, referred to as the ratings-based multi-level
approach, would permit reduced risk-based capital assessments for second dollar loss credit enhancers (both recourse
and direct credit substitute providers) and for senior investors in eligible securitization transactions.
<FOOTCITE>30</FOOTCITE>
 The Agencies also seek comment on whether a multi-level approach is needed for unrated securitization transactions
and, if so, on how such a system could be designed. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<FOOTNOTE>
<FOOTNAME>
<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->
30
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

</FOOTNAME>
<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->
The reduction in the risk-based capital charge for second dollar loss enhancements would be in relation to the treatment
that the Agencies are considering proposing for second dollar loss direct credit substitutes that do not qualify
for the ratings-based multi-level approach (see discussion below). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
</FOOTNOTE>

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
A. Ratings-Based Multi-Level Approach 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
1. Threshold Criteria 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The ratings-based multi-level approach would be restricted to transactions involving the securitization of large,
diversified asset pools in which all forms of first dollar loss credit enhancement are either completely free of third-party
performance risk (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
i.e.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, the inability of the credit enhancer to perform) or are provided internally as part of the securitization structure,
as specified below. The diversification requirement and the requirement that all first dollar loss credit enhancement
be free from third-party performance risk are intended to protect the first dollar loss enhancement from default
risk associated with any single party. For purposes of applying a multi-level approach, it is important to minimize
the possibility that the first dollar loss enhancement will be exhausted because the presence of this prior enhancement
will be the basis, in most transactions, for allowing lower risk-based capital assessments on the second dollar loss
and senior positions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For a transaction to qualify for the ratings-based multi-level approach, the first dollar loss credit enhancement
could be provided in any of the following four ways: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Cash collateral accounts;
<FOOTCITE>31</FOOTCITE>
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<FOOTNOTE>
<FOOTNAME>
<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->
31
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

</FOOTNAME>
<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->
A cash collateral account is a separate account funded with a loan from the provider of the enhancement. Funds in the
account are available to cover potential losses. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
</FOOTNOTE>

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
&bull;Subordinated interests or classes of securities; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Spread accounts, including those that are funded initially with a loan that is repaid from excess cash flows;
<FOOTCITE>32</FOOTCITE>
 and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<FOOTNOTE>
<FOOTNAME>
<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->
32
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

</FOOTNAME>
<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->
A spread account is typically a trust or special account that the issuer establishes to retain interest rate payments
in excess of the amounts due investors from the underlying assets, plus a normal servicing fee rate. The excess spread
serves as a cushion to cover potential losses on the underlying loans. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
</FOOTNOTE>

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
&bull;Other forms of overcollateralization involving excess cash flows, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
e.g.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, placing excess receivables into the pool so that total cash flows expected to be received exceed cash flows needed
to pay investors.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Cash collateral accounts and subordinated interests are free of third-party performance risk because they stand
ready to absorb a given percentage of total losses from the underlying assets regardless of the financial condition
of the party that funds the cash collateral account or holds the subordinated interest. Spread accounts and other
forms of overcollateralization can provide a similar type of insulation from exposure to any one party if the asset
securitization is based on a large, well diversified pool of assets. These forms of internal credit enhancement depend
on expected excess cash flows from the underlying assets and thus are subject to the risk that the excess cash may not
materialize if default rates among the underlying borrowers exceed expectations. Restricting application of the
ratings-based multi-level approach to large, well diversified asset pools is intended to minimize this risk. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Transactions with first dollar loss credit enhancements that are subject to third-party performance risk, such
as financial standby letters of credit or repurchase obligations (which are subject to the risk that the provider
fails to perform), and transactions that do not involve the securitization of large, well diversified asset pools
would not be eligible for the ratings-based multi-level approach. Banking organizations and thrifts that participate
as credit enhancers or investors in these types of securitization transactions would not be eligible for the reduced
risk-based capital assessments available under this approach. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
2. Risk-Based Capital Treatment of First Dollar Loss Positions 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The risk-based capital treatment of credit enhancements provided by banking organizations or thrifts in transactions
that qualify for the ratings-based multi-level approach would depend on the loss position of the credit enhancement.
First dollar loss enhancements, whether provided as recourse or direct credit substitutes, would be required to
hold capital dollar-for-dollar against their face amount, up to the full, effective risk-based capital requirement
for the outstanding amount of the assets enhanced.
<FOOTCITE>33</FOOTCITE>
 This would essentially incorporate the proposed low-level recourse rule into the treatment of first dollar loss
enhancements under the ratings-based multi-level approach. The dollar-for-dollar capital requirement would
apply to the holders of subordinated interests as well as against the providers of loans used to fund either cash collateral
accounts or spread accounts.
<FOOTCITE>34</FOOTCITE>
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<FOOTNOTE>
<FOOTNAME>
<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->
33
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

</FOOTNAME>
<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->
See note 13. In no event would a single institution be required to hold capital in excess of the amount that would be required
for the full amount of the assets underlying the securitization. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<FOOTNAME>
<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->
34
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

</FOOTNAME>
<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->
First dollar loss enhancement provided through overcollateralization or a spread account (after any banking organization
or thrift's initial loan to that account is repaid) does not impose risk of loss on any banking organization or thrift
(assuming it is not capitalized in any fashion) and would therefore not be subject to an explicit risk-based capital
charge. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
</FOOTNOTE>

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As previously noted, the Agencies are continuing to evaluate the risk-based capital requirements for low-level
recourse arrangements and low-level direct credit substitutes. Because the proposed treatment of first dollar
loss positions under the ratings-based multi-level approach incorporates the low-level recourse rule, any modification
of the low-level recourse rule would also affect the proposed treatment of first dollar loss positions. The capital
requirement for these positions should reflect the fact that they generally carry a higher probability of loss relative
to other loss positions in the securitization. However, the Agencies also recognize that the capital requirement
for these positions may appear to be excessive because the probability of total loss for low-level recourse positions
is unlikely to be 100 percent.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Consequently, the Agencies request comment on the proposed treatment of low-level recourse and direct credit substitute
transactions and of first dollar loss positions. In particular, the Agencies invite comment on the following questions:

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
(Question 4)
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Is the proposed dollar-for-dollar capital requirement (up to the full, effective risk-based capital requirement
for the underlying assets) too high for low-level recourse and direct credit substitute transactions or for first
dollar loss positions? If so, why? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
(Question 5)
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 If this proposed capital requirement is too high, how can this be demonstrated or quantified? What methodology could
be used to reduce the capital requirement without jeopardizing safety and soundness? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
(Question 6)
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 If less than dollar-for-dollar capital is required for low-level or other first dollar loss positions, then the probability
of loss to the insurance funds increases. How should the Agencies deal with this increased probability of loss? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
3. Risk-Based Capital Treatment of Second Dollar Loss Positions 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Second dollar loss enhancements that qualify for the ratings-based multi-level approach, whether provided as recourse
or direct credit substitutes, would be assessed risk-based capital only against the amount of the enhancement, and
not against the more senior portions of the pool. This would continue the Banking Agencies' current risk-based capital
treatment of direct credit substitutes and would significantly reduce the amount of capital that is currently required
for second dollar loss recourse positions. All qualifying second dollar loss enhancements, including subordinated
mortgage-backed securities, would be assigned to the 100% risk-weight category. This would continue the Banking
Agencies' current treatment of purchased subordinated positions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
To qualify for treatment as a second dollar loss enhancement under the ratings-based multi-level approach, two requirements
must be satisfied:
<FOOTCITE>35</FOOTCITE>
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<FOOTNOTE>
<FOOTNAME>
<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->
35
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

</FOOTNAME>
<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->
The Agencies intend that any position in a securitization that meets these requirements would qualify for treatment
as a ``second dollar loss enhancement'' under the ratings-based multi-level approach. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
</FOOTNOTE>

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
&bull;The securitization transaction itself would have to qualify for this approach (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
i.e.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, it would involve a large, well diversified pool of assets and all forms of first dollar loss enhancement would be limited
to the four types that are described above), and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;The enhancement would have to meet specified minimum credit rating requirements, as explained below. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For second dollar loss enhancements in the form of middle level or subordinated interests or securities, the interest
or security would need a formal credit rating of at least investment grade from a nationally recognized statistical
rating organization. The rating would be acceptable only if the same rating organization also provided the credit
rating for each rated portion or security of the securitization. Risk-based capital would be assessed against qualifying
middle level or subordinated interests or securities at the 100% risk-weight, based on the carrying value of the interest
or security. No additional risk-based capital would be required for these qualifying interests or securities to
support the more senior interests in the pool. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
See
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Example 1. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For second dollar loss enhancements in the form of financial standby letters of credit or other guarantee-type arrangements,
the Agencies are considering two alternatives. One alternative would require that the portion of the underlying
asset pool covered by the standby letter of credit must receive a formal credit rating of at least investment grade
from a nationally recognized statistical rating organization. See Example 2A. The second alternative would require
that the entire asset pool receive a formal credit rating of investment grade prior to the addition of the standby letter
of credit.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

</FOOTNAME>
<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->
The credit ratings required under both alternatives are not the same as the credit rating that would be obtained for
purposes of marketing the senior investment portions of the pool, which would represent an evaluation of the credit
quality of the top portion of the asset pool, after the second dollar loss enhancement (and any other enhancement)
is added. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
(Question 7)
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Agencies request comment on which of these alternatives would be more appropriate for purposes of applying the
ratings-based multi-level approach. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
(Question 8)
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Agencies request comment on whether the above-described credit rating requirement for second dollar loss enhancements
should be established at a higher level than investment grade. In particular, the Agencies seek information on the
extent to which banking organizations and thrifts currently purchase subordinated interests (including middle
level subordinated interests) and on the typical credit ratings for such purchased subordinated interests. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
(Question 9)
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Agencies request comment on how application of the ratings-based multi-level approach to second dollar loss
enhancements would affect banking organizations or thrifts that provide financial standby letters of credit for
asset-backed commercial paper programs and other asset securitizations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A second dollar loss enhancement could qualify for this treatment even if it were not free of third-party performance
risk. For example, a financial standby letter of credit, which has third party performance risk, could qualify for
this preferential capital treatment if it had qualifying first-loss protection. That is, even though a financial
standby letter of credit would not be considered to qualify for first loss protection for purposes of determining
the capital requirement of more senior loss positions, the standby letter of credit itself could qualify for the treatment
described above. Risk-based capital would be assessed at the 100% risk-weight against the face amount of the standby
letter of credit. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
It is possible that an asset securitization involving a large, well-diversified asset pool might satisfy the above
credit rating requirements simply on the basis of asset quality, without the addition of any credit enhancement.
In this circumstance, the risk of loss associated with providing credit enhancement for investment grade assets
should be the same, regardless of whether the investment grade rating is based solely on asset quality or on some combination
of asset quality plus first dollar loss credit enhancement. Therefore, the Agencies are considering whether to treat
``first dollar loss'' enhancements that provide credit support to pools or portions of pools (depending on which
alternative is selected, as explained above) that have a formal credit rating of at least investment grade rating
on a stand-alone basis in the same manner that qualifying second dollar loss enhancements would be treated under the
ratings-based multi-level approach. See Example 3. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
(Question 10)
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Agencies request comment on this possible treatment of ``first dollar loss'' enhancements of investment grade
assets. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Second dollar loss credit enhancements that are rated below investment grade or do not meet the other criteria stated
above would not qualify for reduced capital requirements under the ratings-based multi-level approach.
<FOOTCITE>37</FOOTCITE>
 The Agencies are considering requiring risk-based capital for such second dollar loss enhancements based on the
amount of the enhancement plus all more senior positions, up to the lower of the size of the enhancement or the full risk-based
capital requirement. (The provider of the second dollar loss enhancement would not be required to hold risk-based
capital against the portion of the asset pool that is covered by the first dollar loss enhancement.)

Because banks and thrifts are generally restricted from purchasing corporate debt securities rated below investment
grade, this discussion primarily applies to second dollar loss positions, such as financial standby letters of credit,
that are not in the form of subordinated securities. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
</FOOTNOTE>

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Agencies are concerned that assigning a single capital treatment to all second dollar loss positions rated below
investment grade may not adequately reflect the variation in credit risk of assets rated below investment grade.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
(Question 11)
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Agencies request comment on modifications to the capital requirement for second dollar loss enhancements rated
below investment grade to better reflect different levels of credit risk. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In the event that the Agencies do not proceed with implementation of a multi-level approach, the Agencies would expect
to propose amendments to the risk-based capital standards that would assess risk-based capital against all second
dollar loss positions based on their face amounts plus the face amounts of all more senior outstanding positions (up
to the maximum size of the second dollar loss position). For this reason the Agencies are particularly interested
in receiving comment on all aspects of the ratings-based multi-level approach.

4. Risk-Based Capital Treatment of Senior Securities 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Under the ratings-based multi-level approach, a senior security could qualify for a 20 percent risk weight, regardless
of the risk-weight of the underlying assets, if: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;The securitization involves a large, well diversified pool of assets, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;All prior credit enhancement is limited to the permissible forms, and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;The security has received the highest possible rating from the same rating organization that provided the
credit rating (if any) associated with the second dollar loss enhancement. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This preferential risk-based capital treatment for qualifying senior securities would apply regardless of whether
a second dollar loss enhancement for the same transaction also qualifies for preferential treatment under the ratings-based
multi-level approach. Senior securities that do not meet all of the specified conditions would be required to hold
capital at the risk-weight appropriate to the pooled assets, in accordance with the current risk-based capital standards.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The term ``senior security'' would mean that no class of securities has a prior claim to payment from the underlying
assets. Securities that do not have the first claim to payment would be treated as first or second dollar loss enhancements
under the ratings-based multi-level approach (regardless of their credit rating).

Senior securities that are not paid out until after another class or classes of securities from the same issue is completely
paid out would be considered ``senior securities'' for purposes of the ratings-based multi-level approach, provided
that they do not provide credit enhancement for another class of securities and that losses are shared on a pro rata
basis in the event of default.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Agencies request comment on whether a class of securities that receives the highest investment grade rating but
is not the most senior class in a qualifying transaction should also be eligible for the 20% risk-weight category under
the ratings-based multi-level approach.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
(Question 13)
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Agencies request comment on whether the ratings-based multi-level approach should be further adjusted to reflect
the reduced risk of loss associated with positions rated above the minimum investment grade rating but below the highest
investment grade rating. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed favorable risk-based capital treatment of senior securities would be restricted to transactions in
which all of the credit enhancement, including all second dollar loss credit enhancements, is either completely
free of third-party performance risk or is provided internally through the securitization structure. Thus, to be
eligible for the reduced risk-based capital assessment, a senior security would have to be supported solely by cash
collateral accounts, subordinated interests (including middle level subordinated positions), spread accounts,
or other forms of overcollateralization. If any part of the total credit enhancement provided is subject to third-party
performance risk, then the senior portion of the issue would not be eligible for a reduced risk-based capital requirement
under the ratings-based multi-level approach, regardless of its rating.
<FOOTCITE>39</FOOTCITE>
 For example, if a financial standby letter of credit provides second dollar loss enhancement for an asset securitization,
then the senior portion of that securitization would not be eligible for the 20% risk-weight. Risk-based capital
would be held against the amount of the standby letter of credit and all portions of the transaction that are senior
to the standby letter of credit in accordance with the current risk-based capital standards. See Example 4.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposed favorable risk-based capital treatments for second dollar loss enhancements and senior securities
under the ratings-based multi-level approach would be contingent upon maintenance of the required minimum ratings.
If second dollar loss enhancement is downgraded below investment grade, if the senior securities are downgraded
below the highest possible rating, or if either rating is withdrawn by the rating organization that provided the initial
ratings, then the capital requirement would be adjusted accordingly.

6. Conclusion 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Agencies believe that this preliminary proposal for a ratings-based multi-level approach could eliminate or
reduce many of the concerns with the current treatment of recourse and direct credit substitutes. This approach would:

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Incorporate the proposed low-level recourse rule, so that an institution's capital would never exceed the
contractual maximum amount of its exposure; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Equalize the treatment of recourse arrangements and direct credit substitutes that present equivalent risk
of loss; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Add flexibility to the regulatory capital requirements for recourse arrangements and direct credit substitutes
by taking into account the different degrees of credit risk associated with first dollar loss and second dollar loss
credit enhancements and senior positions for those asset securitizations where formal credit ratings are provided
for the various positions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The use of credit ratings would provide a way for the Agencies to use market determinations of credit quality to identify
different loss positions for capital purposes in an asset securitization structure. The use of ratings could also
enable the approach to be applied to large, well diversified pools of non-homogeneous assets, such as small business
loans, because the market would determine the level of credit support necessary to obtain the various credit ratings.
This may permit the Agencies to give more equitable treatment to a wide variety of transactions and structures in administering
the risk-based capital system. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The flexibility of such a system would be particularly apparent in transactions that use overcollateralization
to provide first dollar loss credit enhancement because the amount of the excess collateral will vary based on factors
such as the quality of the underlying assets. One pool of assets may require 5% overcollateralization and another
may require 20% overcollateralization to raise the credit quality of the pools to the investment grade level. Even
though the second pool in this example has a greater amount of overcollateralization, the provider of second dollar
loss enhancement for this transaction would not necessarily be in a safer loss position than the provider of second
dollar loss enhancement for the pool that required only 5% overcollateralization. The use of credit ratings to determine
the amount of first dollar loss protection could provide the Agencies with an inherently flexible method for identifying
when an adequate first dollar loss position has been reached and when the second dollar loss position begins.

(Question 14)
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 While the agencies believe that a ratings-based multi-level approach may be less costly for banking organizations
and thrifts than a multi-level approach that depends more heavily on quantitative and qualitative analysis of individual
securitizations and the positions within them, the agencies request comment on the costs of obtaining and monitoring
ratings over time and on how these costs might compare with the cost of having to examine each position for purposes
of determining its risk-based capital requirement. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
B. Multi-Level Approach for Unrated Securitizations 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The ratings-based multi-level approach relies on credit ratings to permit reduced risk-based capital requirements
for qualifying credit enhancements and senior securities in certain asset securitizations. However, not all asset
securitizations are rated and, in some securitizations, certain portions may be rated while others may be unrated.
The Agencies recognize that there could be a need for a separate multi-level approach to establish capital requirements
for unrated securitizations and unrated portions of rated securitizations. In theory, there are several ways to
proceed. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The ideal multi-level approach for unrated securitizations would set capital requirements roughly equivalent
to those for rated securitizations. To determine whether the credit quality of an unrated credit enhancement or security
is similar to a rated credit enhancement or security, banking organizations and thrifts would need to: (1) Know the
current loss position of the credit enhancement or security being evaluated, and (2) have current information on
the credit quality of the underlying assets. This information could then be used in conjunction with a formula that
relates the capital requirement for a credit enhancement or security to its loss position and the credit quality of
the underlying assets. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Alternatively, the Agencies could develop a multi-level approach for unrated securitizations that assigns capital
requirements based purely on a quantitative measure of sequential loss exposure (that is, the amount of loss protection
provided by more junior positions), without regard to underlying asset quality. A refinement in this approach would
be to develop quantitative measures for each asset type to reflect each type's default characteristics. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
These alternatives represent two of the possible ways to establish a multi-level approach for unrated securitizations.
The Agencies request comment on these and any other options. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If the Agencies do not proceed with a multi-level approach for unrated securitizations, they expect to extend the
current risk-based capital treatment of recourse transactions to all unrated credit enhancements (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
i.e.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, capital would be required against the face amount of the credit enhancement plus all more senior positions). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Agencies request comment on the following questions: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
(Question 15)
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Is there a need for a multi-level approach for unrated securitizations and unrated portions of rated securitizations?

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
(Question 16)
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Should the credit quality of the underlying loans be given additional consideration (beyond that present in the current
risk-based capital requirements) in the capital requirements for unrated transactions? If so, how would this be
accomplished? What other information, if any, should be considered in determining the capital requirements? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
(Question 17)
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Should the loss position of the credit enhancement or security be taken into account in determining capital requirements
for unrated transactions? If so, how would the loss position be determined? In particular, how should forms of prior
enhancement such as overcollateralization and spread accounts be treated? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
(Question 18)
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 If the Agencies were to develop a multi-level approach that incorporates both qualitative and quantitative elements
(the first alternative presented above), what problems might banking organizations and thrifts encounter in obtaining
and maintaining the necessary information on loss positions and credit quality? How could the Agencies ensure consistent
use of this information in determining loss positions and assigning capital requirements? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
(Question 19)
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 If the Agencies were to develop a multi-level approach based solely on quantitative measurement of loss positions
(the second alternative presented above), how should such an approach be designed? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
(Question 20)
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 How might a multi-level approach be designed so that positions that would not, if rated, qualify for reduced capital
requirements under the ratings-based approach, also would not qualify for reduced capital requirements under the
multi-level approach for unrated transactions? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
(Question 21)
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 How can a multi-level approach for unrated securitizations be designed so it does not create an unreasonable bias
toward or away from obtaining ratings?

IV. Application of Any Final Rules 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Agencies intend that any final rules adopted in connection with this notice of proposed rulemaking and advance
notice of proposed rulemaking that result in increased risk-based capital requirements for banking organizations
or thrifts would apply only to transactions that are consummated after the effective date of such final rules. The
Agencies intend that any final rules adopted in connection with this notice that result in reduced risk-based capital
requirements for banking organizations or thrifts would apply to all transactions outstanding as of the effective
date of such final rules and to all subsequent transactions.

Example 1A_Senior/Subordinated Structure 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Bank A issues three classes of securities that are backed by a $212 million, well-diversified pool of residential
mortgage loans that individually qualify for the 50% risk-weight category_a bottom-level subordinated class of
$12 million, a middle-level subordinated class of $20 million and a senior class of $180 million. Bank A retains the
bottom-level class and sells the other two classes to banking organizations or thrifts. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Bank A, retaining the bottom-level subordinated class, would be required to hold risk-based capital equal to 4% of
the $212 million pool (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
i.e.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, the full effective risk-based capital requirement for the outstanding amount of the assets enhanced). Because
this subordinated class provides sufficient first dollar loss enhancement, a nationally recognized statistical
rating organization gives the $20 million middle class an investment grade rating. Since this class is rated investment
grade, risk-based capital would be held against it at the 100% risk-weight, based solely on its carrying value. That
is, the holder of the middle-level class would not be required to hold any capital against the senior class it supports.
The same rating organization gives its highest credit rating to the $180 million senior class. Since this is the most
senior class, has the highest possible credit rating, and all prior enhancements are performance risk-free, risk-based
capital would be calculated at the 20% risk-weight. Table 1 summarizes this example.

1Under the Banking Agencies' existing capital rules the capital charges for retained first and second loss positions
differ from the capital requirements for purchased first and second loss positions. For example, a bank must hold
regulatory capital equal to 8 percent of the carrying value of a purchased subordinated position at the 100% risk-weight,
whereas a retained subordinated position is subject to a capital requirement against the full value of all the assets
enhanced. (In contrast, the OTS treats both of these positions in the same way, requiring capital against the full
value of the assets enhanced.) The proposed new rules would eliminate such disparate capital treatment by focusing
the capital charge on the risk of recourse arrangements or credit substitutes, rather than the manner in which they
are acquired. Note, however, that other rules restricting banks from purchasing or holding securities that are of
less than investment grade quality already limit the opportunities to exploit the disparities present in existing
capital rules.

Example 1B_A First Loss Position That Qualifies for the Low-Level Recourse Rule 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Bank A issues three classes of securities that are backed by a $212 million, well-diversified pool of consumer loans
that individually qualify for the 100% risk-weight category_a bottom-level subordinated class of $12 million,
a middle-level subordinated class of $20 million and a senior class of $180 million. Bank A retains the bottom-level
class and sells the other two classes to banking organizations or thrifts. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Without the proposed low-level recourse rule, Bank A's capital requirement for the $12 million bottom-level subordinated
class would be $16.96 million, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
i.e.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, a full risk-based capital requirement of 8% against the $212 million mortgage pool enhanced by this class. The low-level
recourse rule, however, would allow the risk-based capital requirement to fall below the full effective capital
requirement when the recourse obligation falls below the full effective capital requirement. Thus, the capital
requirement would be the lesser of either the maximum contractual recourse obligation or the full effective capital
requirement. Consequently, the bottom-level class in this example would be assessed dollar-for-dollar capital
up to its $12 million carrying value, for a capital requirement of $12 million. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Because the bottom-level subordinated class provides sufficient first dollar loss enhancement, a nationally recognized
statistical rating organization gives the $20 million middle class an investment grade rating. Since this class
is rated investment grade, risk-based capital would be assessed against it at the 100% risk-weight, based solely
on its carrying value. That is, the holder of the middle-level class would not be assessed any capital against the senior
class it supports. The same rating organization gives its highest credit rating to the $180 million senior class.
Since this is the most senior class, has the highest possible credit rating, and all prior enhancements are performance
risk-free, risk-based capital would be assessed against this class at the 20% risk-weight. Table 2 summarizes this
example.

Example 2A_Investment Grade Rating Applied to Portion of Pool Covered by Standby Letter of Credit 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
The XYZ Company is seeking the highest possible credit rating on an asset-backed commercial paper issuance that is
backed by a large, well-diversified pool of trade receivables. A total of $200 million of commercial paper is issued
against the pool, which contains $212 million worth of trade receivables. Thus, there is $12 million of overcollateralization
available to provide loss protection. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
To obtain the highest rating for the commercial paper, the XYZ Company also purchases a standby letter of credit from
Bank B that covers the next $20 million of losses after the $12 million of overcollateralization. This letter of credit
provides loss protection analogous to the middle-level subordinated class of securities in Examples 1A and 1B above.
A nationally recognized statistical rating organization provides a formal credit rating of investment grade for
the position, i.e., that portion of pool losses that represents the exposure to be covered by the $20 million letter
of credit. As a result, under the Agencies' first alternative for application of the ratings-based multi-level approach
to this type of transaction, risk-based capital would be assessed against the $20 million standby letter of credit
at the 100% risk-weight, based on its credit equivalent amount. That is, Bank B would not be required to hold capital
against the additional $180 million supported by the standby letter of credit. If the rating given to the letter of
credit was not at least investment grade, then Bank B would be required to hold capital at the 100% risk-weight against
the credit equivalent amount of its letter of credit and all senior classes that it supports (in this case, against
$200 million).

The details of the transaction here are identical to those of example 2A, except that the investment grade rating provided
by a nationally recognized statistical rating organization is not on the second loss position, but on the entire $212
million pool, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 to the addition of Bank B's standby letter of credit. As a result, under the Agencies' second alternative for application
of the ratings-based multi-level approach to this type of transaction, risk-based capital would be assessed against
the $20 million standby letter of credit at the 100% risk-weight, based on its credit equivalent amount. That is, Bank
B would not be required to hold capital against the $180 million of the pool that the standby letter of credit supports,
but does not cover. If the rating given to the entire pool prior to the addition of the letter of credit were not at least
investment grade, then Bank B would be required to hold capital at the 100% risk-weight against the credit equivalent
amount of its letter of credit and all the senior classes that it supports (in this case, against $200 million).

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
If the Agencies adopt the proposed alternative to treat certain ``first dollar loss'' enhancements that have a formal
credit rating of at least investment grade in the same manner as qualifying second dollar loss enhancements, the following
example would apply: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Bank C issues two classes of securities that are backed by a $212 million, well-diversified pool of auto loans_a subordinated
class of $12 million and a senior class of $200 million. Bank C retains the bottom-level class and sells the other class
to either a banking organization or thrift. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Because of the high credit quality of the underlying loans, a nationally-recognized statistical rating organization
gives the $212 million pool of auto loans a rating equal to one level above investment grade on a stand-alone basis.
The $12 million subordinated class is given an investment grade rating. Since this class is rated investment grade,
risk-based capital would be assessed against it at the 100 percent risk-weight, based solely on its carrying value.
That is, Bank C would not be assessed any capital against the senior class it supports. On the basis of the high credit
quality of the underlying loans, and the loss protection provided by the subordinated class, the same rating organization
gives its highest credit rating to the $200 million senior class. Since this is the most senior class, has the highest
possible credit rating, and all prior enhancements are performance risk-free, risk-based capital would be assessed
against this class at the 20 percent risk-weight. Table 3 summarizes this example.

Example 4_Nonqualifying Senior Position 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Bank D issues two classes of securities backed by a $212 million, well-diversified pool of consumer loans_a subordinated
class of $12 million, which would be rated below investment grade, and a senior class of $200 million. Bank D retains
the bottom-level class and sells the other class to a banking organization or thrift. In the absence of additional
credit enhancements, a nationally recognized statistical rating organization will rate the senior class one grade
below its highest credit rating as a result of the first dollar loss enhancement from the subordinated class. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Bank D obtains a letter of credit to provide additional enhancement to the transaction from a company whose obligations
have the highest possible credit rating from the same credit rating organization. The credit rating organization
now gives its highest possible credit rating to the senior class in this transaction. However, since this credit rating
is a result of a prior enhancement that is provided in the form of a standby letter of credit, which has performance risk,
risk-based capital would be assessed against the senior class at the 100% risk-weight rather than at the 20% risk-weight.
Under the ratings-based multi-level approach, the 20% risk-weight would only be applied to qualifying senior interests
that are supported by prior credit enhancements that are in the form of overcollateralization, spread accounts,
cash collateral accounts, or subordinated interests. Table 4 summarizes this example.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
For banking organizations and thrifts in general, or for your particular institution, please answer the following
questions: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(a) For securitized or pooled transactions, and separately for non-securitized transactions, approximately what
portion of third-party financial standby letters of credit provides less than 100% loss protection for the underlying
assets? What are the typical circumstances of such arrangements? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) For securitized or pooled transactions, and separately for non-securitized transactions, do financial standby
letters of credit typically absorb the first dollars of losses or the second dollars of losses from third-party assets,
as defined in this section of the proposal? What is the approximate dollar amount of financial standby letters of credit
provided by banking organizations and thrifts that absorb the first dollars of losses from third-party assets? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) What is the approximate dollar amount of purchased subordinated interests that absorb the first dollars of losses
from third-party assets, as defined in this section of the proposal?

(Question 26) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Should the Agencies require that prior credit enhancements be free of performance risk in order for second dollar
loss enhancements and senior positions to qualify for reduced risk-based capital requirements?

(Question 27) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The discussion of the multi-level approach deals with varying the capital requirement in asset securitizations
based on an institution's degree of exposure to credit risk. Does a multi-level approach have any applicability to
sales or participations of individual, secured, unrated loans (including multifamily loans) with recourse under
various loss sharing arrangements?

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
It is hereby certified that the proposed changes to the Agencies' risk-based capital standards will not have a significant
economic impact on a substantial number of small entities, in accord with the spirit and purposes of the Regulatory
Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et seq.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
). Most of the transactions that will be affected by the proposed changes are conducted by large banking organizations
and large thrifts. In addition, consistent with current policy, the FRB's revised guidelines generally will not
apply to bank holding companies with consolidated assets of less than $150 million. The intent of the proposal is to
correct certain inconsistencies in the Agencies' risk-based capital standards and to allow banking organizations
to maintain lower amounts of capital against low-level recourse obligations by adopting the current OTS capital
treatment of those transactions. Accordingly, a Regulatory Flexibility Act Analysis is not required.

VIII. Executive Order 12866 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
OCC and OTS have determined that the proposed rule described in this notice is not a significant regulatory action
under Executive Order 12866. Accordingly, a regulatory impact analysis is not required. The intent of the proposal
is to correct certain inconsistencies in the Agencies' risk-based capital standards and to allow banking organizations
to maintain lower amounts of capital against low-level recourse obligations by adopting the current OTS capital
treatment of those transactions. Under the proposal, each institution's measured risk-based capital ratio may
change. However, this change in measured capital ratios should have no material effect on the safety and soundness
of the banking and thrift industries. Most banks and thrifts have capital ratios much in excess of minimum requirements.
Of the 11,071 commercial banks in operation at the end of September 1993, 10,824 were well-capitalized (risk-based
capital ratios in excess of 10 percent). For the thrift industry, as of June 30, 1993, 1,561 of 1,752 savings associations
were similarly well-capitalized. Given the high level of capitalization in the industry, the net effect on the safety
and soundness of the banking industry and the overall economy should be minimal.

Federal Reserve Board under delegated authority from the Office of Management and Budget (OMB). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed amendments to the Capital Adequacy Guidelines may require reporting revisions to the Consolidated
Financial Statements for Bank Holding Companies With Total Consolidated Assets of $150 Million or More or With More
Than One Subsidiary Bank (FR Y&hyph;9C; OMB No. 7100&hyph;0128). Any revisions will be determined by the Federal

Recourse

 means the retention, in form or substance, of any risk of loss directly or indirectly associated with a transferred
asset that exceeds a pro rata share of a national bank's claim on the asset. If a national bank has no claim on a transferred
asset, then the retention of any risk of loss is recourse. A recourse arrangement typically arises when an institution
transfers assets and retains an obligation to repurchase the assets or absorb losses due to a default of principal
or interest or any other deficiency in the performance of the underlying obligor or some other party. Recourse arrangements
include, but are not limited to: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) Representations and warranties about the transferred assets other than standard representations and warranties
as defined in this section 1(c) of this appendix A;

(ii) Retained loan servicing rights if the servicer is responsible for losses associated with the loans being serviced
(other than servicer cash advances as defined in this section 1(c) of this appendix A; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) Retained subordinated interests or securities that absorb more than their pro rata share of losses from the

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iv) Assets sold under an agreement to repurchase; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

of the underlying loan.

Servicer cash advance 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
means funds that a loan servicer advances to ensure an uninterrupted flow of payments or the timely collection of loans,
including disbursements made to cover foreclosure costs or other expenses arising from a loan to facilitate its timely
collection. A servicer cash advance is not recourse or a direct credit substitute if the servicer is entitled to full
reimbursement, or for any one loan, nonreimbursable amounts are contractually limited to an insignificant amount
of the outstanding principal on that loan. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
Standard representations and warranties 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
means contractual provisions that a national bank extends when it transfers assets (including loan servicing rights),
or assumes when it purchases loan servicing rights, that refer to existing facts at the time the assets are transferred
or servicing rights are acquired and that have been verified with reasonable due diligence by the transferor or servicer.
Standard representations and warranties also include contractual provisions for the return of assets in the event
of fraud or documentation deficiencies. Standard representations and warranties do not constitute recourse or
direct credit substitutes.

Mortgage loans sold in transactions in which the bank retains only an insignificant amount of risk and makes concurrent
provision for that risk are not considered assets sold with recourse under section 3. In order to qualify for sales
treatment, such transactions must meet three conditions: (1) The bank has not retained any significant risk of loss,
either directly or indirectly; (2) The bank's maximum contractual exposure under the recourse provision (or through
the retention of a subordinated interest in the mortgages) at the time of the transfer is equal to or less than the amount
of probable loss that the bank has reasonably estimated that it will incur on the transferred mortgages; and (3) The
bank must have created a liability account or other special reserve in an amount equal to its maximum exposure. The
amount of this liability account or other special reserve may not be included in capital for the purpose of determining
compliance with either the risk-based capital requirement or the leverage ratio; nor may it be included in the allowance
for loan and lease losses.

 Except as otherwise provided by this paragraph, the on-balance sheet credit equivalent amount for a recourse arrangement
or direct credit substitute is the amount of assets from which risk of loss is directly or indirectly retained or assumed.
For purposes of this section 3(c) of this appendix A, the amount of assets from which risk of loss is directly or indirectly
retained or assumed means: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) For a financial guarantee-type standby letter of credit, guarantee, or other guarantee-type arrangement, the
assets that the direct credit substitute fully or partially supports; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) For a subordinated interest or security, the amount of the subordinated interest or security plus all more senior
interests or securities; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) For mortgage servicing rights that are recourse arrangements or direct credit substitutes, the outstanding
amount of the loans serviced; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iv) For representations and warranties (other than standard representations and warranties), the amount of the
loans subject to the representations or warranties; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) There is a prior credit enhancement that absorbs the first dollars of loss from the underlying assets that the direct
credit substitute fully or partially supports; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) The direct credit substitute is either: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(A) A financial guarantee-type standby letter of credit, guarantee or other guarantee-type arrangement that absorbs
the second dollars of loss from the underlying assets; or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

Participations.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
 The on-balance sheet credit equivalent amount for a participation interest in a standby letter of credit, guarantee,
or other guarantee-type arrangement is calculated as follows: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) Determine the on-balance sheet credit equivalent amount as if the bank held all of the interests in the participation.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) Multiply the on-balance sheet credit equivalent amount determined under section 3(c)(5)(i) of this appendix
A by the percentage of the bank's participation interest. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) If the bank is exposed to more than its pro rata share of the risk of loss on the direct credit substitute (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
e.g.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
, the bank remains secondarily liable on participations held by others), add to the amount computed under section
3(c)(5)(ii) of this appendix A an amount computed as follows: multiply the amount computed under 3(c)(5)(i) by the
percentage of the direct credit substitute held by others and then multiply the result by the risk-weight appropriate
for the holders of those interests. (Note that this risk-weighting is in addition to the risk-weighting done to convert
the on-balance sheet credit equivalent amount to the risk-weighted asset amount under section 3(c)(2) of this appendix
A.)

 If the maximum contractual liability or exposure to loss retained or assumed by a bank in connection with a recourse

or direct credit substitute, the risk-based capital requirement is limited to the maximum contractual liability

 If a bank holds a mortgage-related security or a participation certificate as a result of a mortgage loan swap with
recourse, capital is required to support the recourse obligation and that percentage of the mortgage-related security
or participation certificate that is not covered by the recourse obligation. The total amount of capital required
for the on-balance sheet asset and the recourse obligation, however, is limited to the capital requirement for the
underlying loans, calculated as if the bank continued to hold these loans as an on-balance sheet asset.

Recourse arrangements and direct credit substitutes.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
 Banks may engage in activities_such as securitizing pools of assets, selling single assets, and entering into certain
off-balance sheet transactions_that result in the provision of a credit enhancement in the form of a recourse arrangement
or a direct credit substitute. The risk-based capital treatment of recourse arrangements and direct credit substitutes
is discussed in section III.D of this appendix A. The following definitions of the terms ``recourse'' and ``direct
credit substitute'' apply for risk-based capital purposes. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Recourse is the retention, in form or in substance, of any risk of loss directly or indirectly associated with an asset
a bank has transferred that is in excess of the bank's 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
pro rata
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
 share of the asset. A recourse arrangement typically arises when an institution transfers an asset and retains an
obligation to repurchase the asset or to absorb losses on the asset arising from a default of principal or interest
or any other deficiencies in the performance of the underlying obligor or some other party. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A direct credit substitute is the assumption, in form or substance through a nonrecourse arrangement, of any risk
of loss directly or indirectly associated with an asset or other claim in excess of the bank's 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
pro rata
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
 share of the asset or other claim. A direct credit substitute arrangement typically arises when an institution issues
a standby letter of credit, purchases a subordinated security that provides loss protection to more senior securities,
or purchases servicing rights, such as mortgage servicing rights, that obligate the servicer to provide credit protection
to the third-party owners of the assets being serviced. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For most direct credit substitutes, the amount of the bank's exposure to be converted to an on-balance sheet credit
equivalent typically is the full face value of the item. However, for direct credit substitutes, such as purchased
subordinated securities that are carried on the balance sheet and directly or indirectly absorb the first losses
from a third-party asset, pool of assets, or other claim, the full amount of the bank's off-balance sheet exposure
that is to be converted is the entire outstanding principal amount of the asset, pool of assets, or other claim, less
the amount of the on-balance sheet direct credit substitute against which capital is already held. This treatment
applies regardless of whether the direct credit substitute fully or partially supports the asset, pool of assets,
or other claim. The full amount of the bank's off-balance sheet exposure to be converted may be the same or greater than
the face value of the direct credit substitute. For instance, in the case of purchased subordinated securities that
absorb first losses, the entire outstanding principal amount of all more senior securities that are supported by
that subordinated interest (to the extent they are not already reported on the bank's balance sheet) are converted
to an on-balance sheet credit-equivalent amount.

For risk-based capital purposes, non-standard representations or warranties a bank may extend in transferring
assets (including the transfer of servicing rights), or may assume in other transactions, including the acquisition
of loan servicing rights, are treated as recourse or direct credit substitutes.

24a
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
 Standard representations and warranties, which normally do not constitute recourse or direct credit substitutes
for risk-based capital purposes, are contractual provisions referring to an existing set of facts that has been verified
with reasonable due diligence by the seller or servicer at the time the assets are transferred or loan servicing rights
are acquired. Standard representations and warranties also include contractual provisions that provide for the
return of the assets to the seller in instances of fraud or upon determination by the purchaser that the assets transferred
are not fully and properly documented or otherwise as represented by the seller.

A cash advance by a loan servicer does not constitute recourse or a direct credit substitute if the servicer is entitled
to full reimbursement, or for any one loan, nonreimbursable amounts are contractually limited to an insignificant
amount of the outstanding principal on that loan. A servicer cash advance is an arrangement under which the servicer
advances funds to ensure an uninterrupted flow of payments to investors or the timely collection of loans. Funds advanced
to ensure the timely collection of loans include disbursements made to cover foreclosure costs or other expenses
incurred to facilitate the timely collection of a loan.

Before an off-balance sheet item can be incorporated into the risk-based capital ratio, the on-balance sheet credit-equivalent
amount of the item must be determined. Once the credit-equivalent amount is determined, the amount is then assigned
to the appropriate risk category according to the obligor, or if relevant, the guarantor or the nature of the collateral.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
 The method for determining the credit-equivalent amount of an interest-rate or exchange-rate contract is set forth
in section III.E.2 of this appendix A. For most other types of off-balance sheet items, the on-balance sheet credit-equivalent
amount is determined by multiplying the full amount of the bank's exposure under the item by the applicable credit
conversion factor as set forth below and in Attachment IV to this appendix A.

</FOOTNAME>
<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->
The sufficiency of collateral and guarantees for off-balance sheet items is determined by the market value of the
collateral or the amount of the guarantee in relation to the face amount of the item, except for interest- and exchange-rate
contracts, for which this determination is made in relation to the credit-equivalent amount. Collateral and guarantees
are subject to the same provisions noted under section III.B of this appendix A.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
However, in the case of direct credit substitutes_which are described in detail in section III.B.5 of this appendix
A and section III.D.1 of this appendix A_that directly or indirectly absorb the first losses from an asset, pool of
assets, or other claim, the full amount of a bank's exposure that is to be converted is the entire outstanding principal
amount of the asset, pool of assets, or other claim, less the amount of any on-balance sheet exposure associated with
the item against which capital is already held. This treatment applies regardless of whether the direct credit substitute
fully or partially supports the asset, pool of assets, or other claim. The full amount of the bank's exposure to be converted
may be the same or greater than the face value of the direct credit substitute. For instance, in the case of standby letters
of credit that absorb first losses, the entire outstanding principal amount of a customer's loan or debt instrument
that is supported by the letter of credit is converted to an on-balance sheet credit-equivalent amount. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Generally, the full face value of an off-balance sheet item is converted to an on-balance sheet credit-equivalent
amount and incorporated in weighted risk assets and, thus, is subject to a full effective risk-based capital requirement.
However, the aggregate capital requirement on a first loss direct credit substitute or a recourse transaction (including
a transaction reported as a financing on a bank's balance sheet) is limited to the maximum contractual amount of loss
to which the direct credit substitute or recourse arrangement exposes the institution if this amount is less than
the effective risk-based capital charge for the asset, pool of assets, or other claim supported by the direct credit
substitutes or recourse arrangement.

Items with a 100 percent conversion factor. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
A 100 percent conversion factor applies to direct credit substitutes, which include guarantees, or equivalent instruments,
backing financial claims such as outstanding securities, loans, and other financial liabilities, or that back off-balance
sheet items that require capital under the risk-based capital framework. Direct credit substitutes include, for
example, financial standby letters of credit, or other equivalent irrevocable undertakings or surety arrangements,
that guarantee repayment of financial obligations such as: commercial paper, tax-exempt securities, commercial
or individual loans or debt obligations, or standby or commercial letters of credit. As described in section III.B.5
of this appendix A, purchases of subordinated securities or of servicing rights may give rise to a direct credit substitute.
Direct credit substitutes also include the acquisition of risk participations in bankers acceptances and standby
letters of credit, since both of these transactions, in effect, constitute a guarantee by the acquiring bank that
the underlying account party (obligor) will repay its obligation to the originating, or issuing, institution.

The full amount of a bank's exposure under a direct credit substitute is converted at 100 percent and the resulting
credit equivalent amount is assigned to the risk category appropriate to the obligor or, if relevant, the guarantor
or the nature of the collateral. In the case of a direct credit substitute in which a risk participation
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=5 f=1 -->
42
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
 has been conveyed, the full amount of the bank's exposure is still converted at 100 percent. However, the credit equivalent
amount that has been conveyed is assigned to whichever risk category is lower: the risk category appropriate to the
obligor, after giving effect to any relevant guarantees or collateral, or the risk category appropriate to the institution
acquiring the participation. Any remainder is assigned to the risk category appropriate to the obligor, guarantor,
or collateral. For example, the portion of a direct credit substitute conveyed as a risk participation to a U.S. domestic
depository institution or foreign bank is assigned to the risk category appropriate to claims guaranteed by those
institutions, that is, the 20 percent risk category.

Financial standby letters of credit are distinguished from loan commitments (discussed below) in that standbys
are irrevocable obligations of the bank to pay a third-party beneficiary when a customer (account party) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
fails to repay
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
 an outstanding loan or debt instrument (direct credit substitute). Performance standby letters of credit (performance
bonds) are irrevocable obligations of the bank to pay a third-party beneficiary when a customer (account party) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
fails to perform
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
 some other contractual non-financial obligation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The distinguishing characteristics of a standby letter of credit for risk-based capital purposes is the combination
of irrevocability with the fact that funding is triggered by some failure to repay or perform an obligation. Thus,
any commitment (by whatever name) that involves an 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
irrevocable
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
 obligation to make a payment to the customer or to a third-party in the event the customer 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
fails to repay
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
 an outstanding debt obligation or 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
fails to perform
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
 a contractual obligation is treated, for risk-based capital purposes, as respectively, a financial guarantee standby
letter of credit or a performance standby. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A loan commitment, on the other hand, involves an obligation (with or without a material adverse change or similar
clause) of the bank to fund its customer 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
in the normal course
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
 of business should the customer seek to draw down the commitment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Sale and repurchase agreements and asset sales with recourse (to the extent not included on the balance sheet) and
forward agreements also are converted at 100 percent. Accordingly, the entire amount of any assets transferred with
recourse that are not already included on the balance sheet, including pools of 1- to 4-family residential mortgages,
is to be converted at 100 percent and assigned to the risk category appropriate to the obligor, or if relevant, the guarantor
or the nature of the collateral. In certain recourse transactions (including those that are reported as a financing
on a bank's balance sheet) the amount of the institution's contractual liability may be limited to an amount less than
the effective risk-based capital requirement for the assets being transferred with recourse. In such cases, the
amount of total capital that must be maintained against the transaction is equal to the maximum amount of possible
loss under the recourse provision. So-called ``loan strips'' (that is, short-term advances sold under long-term
commitments without direct recourse) are defined in the instructions to the commercial bank Call Report and for risk-based
capital purposes as assets sold with recourse. The definition of the term ``recourse'' is set forth in section III.B.5
of this appendix A. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Forward agreements are legally binding contractual obligations to purchase assets with certain drawdown at a specified
future date. Such obligations include forward purchases, forward forward deposits placed,

Securities lent by a bank are treated in one of two ways, depending upon whether the lender is at risk of loss. If a bank,
as agent for a customer, lends the customer's securities and does not indemnify the customer against loss, then the
transaction is excluded from the risk-based capital calculation. If, alternatively, a bank lends its own securities,
or acting as agent for a customer, lends the customer's securities and indemnifies the customer against loss, the
transaction is converted at 100 percent and assigned to the risk weight category appropriate to the obligor, to any
collateral delivered to the lending bank, or, if applicable, to the independent custodian acting on the lender's
behalf. Where a bank is acting as agent for a customer in a transaction involving the lending or sale of securities that
is collateralized by cash delivered to the bank, the transaction is deemed to be collateralized by cash on deposit
in the bank for purposes of determining the appropriate risk weight category, provided that any indemnification
is limited to no more than the difference between the market value of the securities and the cash collateral received
and any reinvestment risk associated with that cash collateral is borne by the customer.

Recourse Arrangements and Direct Credit Substitutes. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
Banking organizations may engage in activities_such as securitizing pools of assets, selling single assets, and
entering into certain off-balance sheet transactions_that result in the provision of a credit enhancement in the
form of a recourse arrangement or a direct credit substitute. The risk-based capital treatment of recourse arrangements
and direct credit substitutes is discussed in section III.D of this appendix A. The following definitions of the terms
``recourse'' and ``direct credit substitute'' apply for risk-based capital purposes.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Recourse is the retention, in form or in substance, of any risk of loss directly or indirectly associated with an asset
a banking organization has transferred that is in excess of the banking organization's 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
pro rata 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
share of the asset. A recourse arrangement typically arises when an institution transfers an asset and retains an
obligation to repurchase the asset or to absorb losses on the asset arising from (a) a default of principal or interest
or (b) any other deficiencies in the performance of the underlying obligor or some other party.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A direct credit substitute is the assumption, in form or substance through a nonrecourse arrangement, of any risk
of loss directly or indirectly associated with an asset or other claim in excess of the banking organization's 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
pro rata
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
 share of the asset or other claim. A direct credit substitute arrangement typically arises when an institution issues
a standby letter of credit, purchases a subordinated security that provides loss protection to more senior securities,
or purchases servicing rights, such as mortgage servicing rights, that obligate the servicer to provide credit protection
to the third-party owners of the assets being serviced.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
For most direct credit substitutes, the amount of the banking organization's exposure to be converted to an on-balance
sheet credit equivalent typically is the full face value of the item. However, for direct credit substitutes, such
as purchased subordinated securities that are carried on the balance sheet that directly or indirectly absorb the
first losses from a third-party asset, pool of assets, or other claim, the full amount of the banking organization's
off-balance sheet exposure that is to be converted is the entire outstanding principal amount of the asset, pool of
assets, or other claim, less the amount of the on-balance sheet direct credit substitute against which capital is
already held. This treatment applies regardless of whether the direct credit substitute fully or partially supports
the asset, pool of assets, or other claim. The full amount of the banking organization's off-balance sheet exposure
may be the same or greater than the face amount of the direct credit substitute. For instance, in the case of purchased
subordinated securities that absorb first losses, the entire outstanding principal amount of all more senior securities
that are supported by that subordinated interest (to the extent they are not already reported on the banking organization's
balance sheet) are converted to an on-balance sheet credit equivalent amount. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For risk-based capital purposes, non-standard representations or warranties a banking organization may extend
in transferring assets (including the transfer of servicing rights), or may assume in other transactions, including
the acquisition of loan servicing rights, are treated as recourse or direct credit substitutes.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=5 f=1 -->
27a
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
 Standard representations and warranties, which normally do not constitute recourse or direct credit substitutes
for risk-based capital purposes, are contractual provisions referring to an existing set of facts that has been verified
with reasonable due diligence by the seller or servicer at the time the assets are transferred or loan servicing rights
are acquired. Standard representations and warranties also include contractual provisions that provide for the
return of the assets to the seller in instances of fraud or upon determination by the purchaser that the assets transferred
are not fully and properly documented or otherwise as represented by the seller.

A cash advance by a loan servicer does not constitute recourse or a direct credit substitute if the servicer is entitled
to full reimbursement, or for any one loan, nonreimbursable amounts are contractually limited to an insignificant
amount of the outstanding principal on that loan. A servicer cash advance is an arrangement under which the servicer
advances funds to ensure an uninterrupted flow of payments to investors or the timely collection of loans. Funds advanced
to ensure the timely collection of loans include disbursements made to cover foreclosure costs or other expenses
incurred to facilitate the timely collection of a loan.

Before an off-balance sheet item can be incorporated into the risk-based capital ratio, the on-balance sheet credit-equivalent
amount of the item must be determined. Once the credit-equivalent is determined, the amount is then assigned to the
appropriate risk category according to the obligor, or, if relevant, the guarantor or the nature of the collateral.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=5 f=1 -->
43
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
 The method for determining the credit-equivalent amount of an interest-rate or exchange-rate contract is set forth
in section III.E.2 of this appendix A. For most other types of off-balance sheet items, the on-balance sheet credit-equivalent
amount is determined by multiplying the full amount of the banking organization's exposure under the item by the applicable
credit conversion factor as set forth below and in Attachment IV to this appendix A.

</FOOTNAME>
<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->
The sufficiency of collateral and guarantees for off-balance sheet items is determined by the market value of the
collateral or the amount of the guarantee in relation to the face amount of the item, except for interest- and exchange-rate
contracts, for which this determination is made in relation to the credit-equivalent amount. Collateral and guarantees
are subject to the same provisions noted under section III.B of this Appendix A. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
</FOOTNOTE>

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
However, in the case of direct credit substitutes_which are described in detail in sections III.B.5 and III.D.1 of
this appendix A_that directly or indirectly absorb the first losses from an asset, pool of assets, or other claim,
the full amount of a banking organization's exposure that is to be converted is the entire outstanding principal amount
of the asset, pool of assets, or other claim, less the amount of any on-balance sheet exposure associated with the item
against which capital is already held. This treatment applies regardless of whether the direct credit substitute
fully or partially supports the asset, pool of assets, or other claim. The full amount of banking organization's exposure
may be the same or greater than the face amount of the direct credit substitute. For instance, in the case of standby
letters of credit that absorb first losses, the entire outstanding principal amount of a customer's loan or debt instrument
that is supported by the letter of credit is converted to an on-balance sheet credit equivalent amount. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Generally, the full face value of an off-balance sheet item is converted to an on-balance sheet credit equivalent
amount and incorporated in weighted risk assets and, thus, is subject to a full effective risk-based capital requirement.
However, the aggregate capital requirement on a first loss direct credit substitute or a recourse transaction is
limited to the maximum contractual amount of loss to which the direct credit substitute or recourse arrangement exposes
the institution if this amount is less than the effective risk-based capital charge for the asset, pool of assets,
or other claim supported by the direct credit substitute or recourse arrangement.

Items with a 100 percent conversion factor.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
 A 100 percent conversion factor applies to direct credit substitutes, which include guarantees, or equivalent instruments,
backing financial claims such as outstanding securities, loans, and other financial liabilities, or that back off-balance
sheet items that require capital under the risk-based capital framework. Direct credit substitutes include, for
example, financial standby letters of credit, or other equivalent irrevocable undertakings or surety arrangements,
that guarantee repayment of financial obligations such as: commercial paper, tax-exempt securities, commercial
or individual loans or debt obligations, or standby or commercial letters of credit. As described in section III.B.5
of this appendix A, purchases of subordinated securities or of servicing rights may give rise to a direct credit substitute.
Direct credit substitutes also include the acquisition of risk participations in bankers acceptances and standby
letters of credit, since both of these transactions, in effect, constitute a guarantee by the acquiring banking organization
that the underlying account party (obligor) will repay its obligation to the originating, or issuing, institution.

 has been conveyed, the full amount of the banking organization's exposure is still converted at 100 percent. However,
the credit-equivalent amount that has been conveyed is assigned to whichever risk category is lower: the risk category
appropriate to the obligor, after giving effect to any relevant guarantees or collateral, or the risk category appropriate
to the institution acquiring the participation. Any remainder is assigned to the risk category appropriate to the
obligor, guarantor, or collateral. For example, the portion of a direct credit substitute conveyed as a risk participation
to a U.S. domestic depository institution or foreign bank is assigned to the risk category appropriate to claims guaranteed
by those institutions, that is, the 20 percent risk category.

The distinguishing characteristics of a standby letter of credit for risk-based capital purposes is the combination
of irrevocability with the fact that funding is triggered by some failure to repay or perform an obligation. Thus,
any commitment (by whatever name) that involves an 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
irrevocable 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
obligation to make a payment to the customer or to a third-party in the event the customer 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
fails to repay 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
an outstanding debt obligation or 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
fails to perform 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
a contractual obligation is treated, for risk-based capital purposes, as respectively, a financial guarantee standby
letter of credit or a performance standby.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A loan commitment, on the other hand, involves an obligation (with or without a material adverse change or similar
clause) of the banking organization to fund its customer 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
in the normal course 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
of business should the customer seek to draw down the commitment.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Sale and repurchase agreements and asset sales with recourse (to the extent not included on the balance sheet) and
forward agreements also are converted at 100 percent.
<FOOTCITE>48</FOOTCITE>
 So-called ``loan strips'' (that is, short-term advances sold under long-term commitments without direct recourse)
are treated for risk-based capital purposes as assets sold with recourse and, accordingly, are also converted at
100 percent. The definition of the term ``recourse'' is set forth in section III.B.5 of this appendix A.

In the regulatory reports and under GAAP, bank holding companies are permitted to treat some asset sales with recourse
as ``true'' sales. For risk-based capital purposes, however, such assets sold with recourse and reported as ``true''
sales by bank holding companies are converted at 100 percent and assigned to the risk category appropriate to the underlying
obligor or, if relevant the guarantor or nature of the collateral, provided that the transactions meet the definition
of assets sold with recourse, including the sale of 1- to 4-family residential mortgages, that is contained in the
instructions to the commercial bank Consolidated Reports of Condition and Income (Call Report). Accordingly, the
entire amount of any assets transferred with recourse that are not already included on the balance sheet, including
pools of 1- to 4-family residential mortgages, is to be converted at 100 percent and assigned to the risk category appropriate
to the obligor, or if relevant, the guarantor or the nature of the collateral. In certain recourse transactions the
amount of the institution's contractual liability may be limited to an amount less than the effective risk-based
capital requirement for the assets being transferred with recourse. In such cases, the amount of total capital that
must be maintained against the transaction is equal to the maximum amount of possible loss under the recourse provision.

Securities lent by a banking organization are treated in one of two ways, depending upon whether the lender is at risk
of loss. If a banking organization, as agent for a customer, lends the customer's securities and does not indemnify
the customer against loss, then the transaction is excluded from the risk-based capital calculation. If, alternatively,
a banking organization lends its own securities, or acting as agent for a customer, lends the customer's securities
and indemnifies the customer against loss, the transaction is converted at 100 percent and assigned to the risk weight
category appropriate to the obligor, to any collateral delivered to the lending banking organization, or, if applicable,
to the independent custodian acting on the lender's behalf. Where a banking organization is acting as agent for a customer
in a transaction involving the lending or sale of securities that is collateralized by cash delivered to the banking
organization, the transaction is deemed to be collateralized by cash on deposit in the banking organization for purposes
of determining the appropriate risk weight category, provided that any indemnification is limited to no more than
the difference between the market value of the securities and the cash collateral received and any reinvestment risk
associated with that cash collateral is borne by the customer.

Recourse Arrangements and Direct Credit Substitutes. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
For purposes of determining the risk-based capital treatment of securitized pools of assets, sales of single assets,
and certain off-balance sheet transactions in which a bank provides credit enhancement, the following definitions
of the terms ``recourse'' and ``direct credit substitute'' apply. The risk-based capital treatment of recourse
arrangements and direct credit substitutes is discussed in section II.D of this appendix A.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
Recourse 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
is the retention, in form or in substance, of any risk of loss directly or indirectly associated with an asset a bank
has transferred that is in excess of the bank's pro rata share of the asset. A recourse arrangement typically arises
when an institution transfers an asset and retains an obligation to repurchase the asset or to absorb losses on the
asset arising from: (a) a default of principal or interest or (b) any other deficiencies in the performance of the underlying
obligor or some other party.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
direct credit substitute 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
is the assumption, in form or in substance through a nonrecourse arrangement, of any risk of loss directly or indirectly
associated with an asset or other claim in excess of the bank's pro rata share of the asset or other claim. A direct credit
substitute arrangement typically arises when an institution issues a financial standby letter of credit, purchases
a subordinated security that provides loss protection to more senior securities, or purchases servicing rights,
such as mortgage servicing rights, that obligate the servicer to provide credit protection to the third party owners
of the assets being serviced.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For most direct credit substitutes, the amount of the bank's exposure to be converted into an on-balance sheet credit
equivalent amount typically is the full face value of the direct credit substitute. However, for direct credit substitutes
carried on the balance sheet that directly or indirectly absorb the first losses from an asset, pool of assets, or other
claim, the full amount of the bank's off-balance sheet exposure that is to be converted is the entire outstanding principal
amount of the asset, pool of assets, or other claim, less the amount of the on-balance sheet direct credit substitute
which is itself being assigned to one of the four broad risk weight categories. This treatment applies regardless
of whether the direct credit substitute fully or partially supports the asset, pool of assets, or other claim. The
full amount of the bank's exposure to be converted may be the same or greater than the face value of the direct credit
substitute. For instance, in the case of purchased subordinated securities that absorb first losses, the entire
outstanding principal amount of all more senior securities that are supported by that subordinated interest (to
the extent they are not already reported on the bank's balance sheet) are converted to an on-balance sheet credit equivalent
amount.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For risk-based capital purposes, nonstandard representations or warranties that a bank may extend in transferring
assets (including the transfer of servicing rights) or assume in other transactions (including the acquisition
of loan servicing rights) are treated as recourse or direct credit substitutes. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
Standard representations and warranties, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
which normally do not constitute recourse or direct credit substitutes for risk-based capital purposes, are contractual
provisions referring to an existing set of facts that has been verified with reasonable due diligence by the seller
or servicer at the time the assets are transferred or loan servicing rights are acquired. Standard representations
and warranties are also generally accompanied by contractual provisions that provide for the return of the assets
to the seller in instances of fraud or upon determination by the purchaser that the assets transferred are not fully
and properly documented or otherwise as represented by the seller.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
servicer cash advance 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
is an arrangement under which the servicer of a loan advances funds to ensure an uninterrupted flow of payments to investors
or the timely collection of loans. Funds advanced to ensure the timely collection of loans include disbursements
made to cover foreclosure costs or other expenses incurred to facilitate the timely collection of a loan. A servicer
cash advance does not constitute recourse or a direct credit substitute if: (a) the servicer is entitled to full reimbursement
for the amount of the advance or (b) for any one loan, nonreimbursable amounts are contractually limited to an insignificant
amount of the outstanding principal on that loan.

In order for an off-balance sheet item to be incorporated into a bank's risk-weighted assets, the on-balance sheet

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
credit equivalent amount 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
of the item must first be determined. Once the credit equivalent amount is determined, this amount is assigned to the
appropriate risk category according to the obligor or, if relevant, the guarantor or the nature of the collateral.
The method for determining the credit equivalent amount of an interest rate or foreign exchange rate contract is set
forth in section II.E.1 of this appendix A. For most other types of off-balance sheet items, the on-balance sheet credit
equivalent amount is determined by multiplying the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
full amount of the bank's exposure 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
under the item by the applicable 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
credit conversion factor 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
as set forth below.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
However, in the case of direct credit substitutes_which are described in detail in sections II.B.6 and II.D.1 of this
appendix A_that directly or indirectly absorb the first losses from an asset, pool of assets, or other claim, the full
amount of the bank's exposure that must be converted to a credit equivalent amount is the entire outstanding principal
amount of the asset, pool of assets, or other claim, less the amount of any on-balance sheet exposure associated with
the item which is itself being assigned to one of the four risk weight categories. This treatment applies regardless
of whether the direct credit substitute fully or partially supports the asset, pool of assets, or other claim. The
full amount of the bank's exposure that must be converted to a credit equivalent amount may be the same as or greater
than the face value of the direct credit substitute. For instance, in the case of financial standby letters of credit
that absorb first losses, the entire outstanding principal amount of the customer's loan or debt instrument that
is supported by the letter of credit is converted to an on-balance sheet credit equivalent amount.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Generally, the full amount of the bank's exposure under an off-balance sheet item is converted to an on-balance sheet
credit equivalent amount and then incorporated in risk-weighted assets and, thus, is subject to a full effective
risk-based capital charge. However, the aggregate capital requirement on a first loss direct credit substitute
or a recourse transaction (including a transaction reported as a financing on a bank's balance sheet) is limited to
the maximum contractual amount of loss to which the direct credit substitute or recourse arrangement exposes the
bank if this amount is less than the full effective risk-based capital charge for the asset, pool of assets, or other
claim that is supported by the bank.

Items With a 100 Percent Conversion Factor. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
A 100 percent conversion factor applies to 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
direct credit substitutes,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
 which include 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
guarantees, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
or equivalent instruments, backing 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
financial
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
 claims, such as outstanding securities, loans, and other financial obligations, or backing off-balance sheet items
that require capital under the risk-based capital framework. These direct credit substitutes include, for example,

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
financial standby letters of credit,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
 or other equivalent irrevocable undertakings or surety arrangements, that effectively guarantee repayment of
financial obligations such as: commercial paper, tax-exempt securities, commercial or individual loans or other
debt obligations, or standby or commercial letters of credit. As described in section II.B.6 of this appendix A, purchases
of 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
subordinated securities
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
 or of 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
servicing rights 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
may give rise to a direct credit substitute. The full amount of a bank's exposure under a direct credit substitute is
converted at 100 percent and the resulting credit equivalent amount is assigned to the risk category appropriate
to the obligor or, if relevant, the guarantor or the nature of the collateral.

Therefore, the distinguishing characteristics of a financial standby letter of credit for risk-based capital purposes
is the combination of irrevocability with the notion that funding is triggered by some failure to repay or perform
on a financial obligation. Thus, any commitment (by whatever name) that involves an 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
irrevocable
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
 obligation to make a payment to the customer or to a third party in the event the customer 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
fails to repay
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
 an outstanding debt obligation will be treated, for risk-based capital purposes, as a financial standby letter of
credit and the full amount of the bank's exposure under the letter of credit will be assigned a 100 percent conversion
factor. (Performance-related standby letters of credit are assigned a conversion factor of 50 percent.)

 in a direct credit substitute to a third party should convert the full amount of its exposure under the direct credit
substitute at a 100 percent conversion factor without deducting the risk participations conveyed. However, portions
of direct credit substitutes that have been conveyed as risk participations to U.S. depository institutions and
OECD banks may then be assigned to the 20 percent risk category that is appropriate for claims guaranteed by U.S. depository
institutions and OECD banks, rather than to the risk category appropriate to the account party obligor.
<FOOTCITE>36</FOOTCITE>
 A bank acquiring a risk participation in a direct credit substitute or bankers acceptance should convert the full
amount of its exposure under the participation at 100 percent and then assign the credit equivalent amount to the risk
category that is appropriate to the account party obligor or, if relevant, the guarantor or the nature of the collateral.

 are also converted at 100 percent. Accordingly, the entire amount of any assets transferred with recourse that are
not already included on the balance sheet, including pools of one-to-four family residential mortgages, is to be
converted at 100 percent and assigned to the risk category appropriate to the obligor or, if relevant, the guarantor
or the nature of the collateral. In certain recourse transactions (including those that are reported as financings
on a bank's balance sheet) the amount of the bank's contractual liability may be limited to an amount less than the full
effective risk-based capital requirement for the assets being transferred with recourse. In such cases, the amount
of capital that must be maintained against the transaction is limited to the maximum amount of possible loss under
the recourse provision. So-called ``loan strips'' and similar arrangements involving short-term loans sold by
a bank without direct recourse but subject to long-term loan commitments by the bank are accorded the same treatment
for risk-based capital purposes as assets sold with recourse. The definition of the term ``recourse'' is set forth
in section II.B.6 of this appendix A. Forward agreements are legally binding contractual obligations to purchase
assets with drawdown which is

Direct credit substitute.

The term 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
direct credit substitute
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 means the assumption, in form or substance (other than recourse obligations as defined in &sect;567.1(kk)), of any
risk of loss directly or indirectly associated with an asset or other claim, that exceeds the savings association's
pro rata share of the asset or claim. If a savings association has no claim on an asset, the assumption of any risk of loss
is a direct credit substitute. Direct credit substitutes include, but are not limited to: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Financial guarantee-type standby letters of credit that support financial claims on the account party; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Guarantees and guarantee-type instruments backing financial claims; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Purchased subordinated interests or securities that absorb more than their pro rata share of losses from the underlying
assets; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) Purchased loan servicing rights if the servicer is responsible for losses associated with the loans being serviced
(other than servicer cash advances as defined in &sect;567.1(nn)), or if the servicer makes or assumes representations
or warranties about the loans (other than standard representations and warranties as defined in &sect;567.1(oo)).

The term 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
recourse
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 means the retention, in form or substance, of any risk of loss directly or indirectly associated with a transferred
asset, that exceeds a pro rata share of the savings association's claim on the asset. If the savings association has
no claim on a transferred asset, the retention of any risk of loss is recourse. A recourse obligation typically arises
when an institution transfers assets and retains an obligation to repurchase the assets, or to absorb losses due to:
a default of principal or interest; or any other deficiency in the performance of the underlying obligor or some other
party. Recourse arrangements include, but are not limited to: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Representations or warranties about the transferred assets other than standard representations and warranties
as defined in &sect;567.1(oo); 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Retained loan servicing rights if the servicer is responsible for losses associated with the loans serviced (other
than servicer cash advances as defined in &sect;567.1(nn)); 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Retained subordinated interests or securities that absorb more than a pro rata share of losses from the underlying
assets; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) Assets sold under an agreement to repurchase; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5) Loan strips sold without direct recourse where the maturity of the participation is shorter than the maturity
of the underlying loan.

 means funds that a loan servicer advances to ensure an uninterrupted flow of payments or the timely collection of loans,
including disbursements made to cover foreclosure costs or other expenses arising from a loan to facilitate its timely
collection. A servicer cash advance is not a recourse arrangement (as defined in &sect;567.1(kk)) or a direct credit
substitute (as defined in &sect;567.1(ff)), if: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) The servicer is entitled to full reimbursement; or

standard representations and warranties
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

 means contractual provisions that a savings association extends when it transfers assets (including loan servicing
rights) or assumes when it purchases loan servicing rights, that refer to existing facts at the time the assets are
transferred or the servicing rights are acquired, and that have been verified with reasonable due diligence by the
transferor or servicer. Standard representations and warranties also include contractual provisions for the return
of assets in the event of fraud or documentation deficiencies. Standard representations and warranties are not recourse
obligations as defined in &sect;567.1(kk) or direct credit substitutes as defined in &sect;567.1(ff).

 Except as otherwise provided by this paragraph (a)(3), the on-balance sheet credit equivalent amount for a recourse
arrangement or direct credit substitute is the amount of assets from which risk of loss is directly or indirectly retained
or assumed. For the purposes of this paragraph (a)(3), the amount of assets from which risk of loss is directly or indirectly
assumed or retained means: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(A) For a financial guarantee-type standby letter of credit, guarantee, or other guarantee-type arrangement, the
assets that the direct credit substitute fully or partially supports; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

 The on-balance sheet credit equivalent amount for certain direct credit substitutes is the face amount of the direct
credit substitute if: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(A) There is a prior credit enhancement that absorbs the first dollars of loss from the underlying assets that the direct
credit substitute fully or partially supports; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(B) The direct credit substitute is a financial guarantee-type standby letter of credit, a guarantee or other guarantee-type
arrangement that absorbs the second dollars of loss from the underlying assets.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iv) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Participations.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The on-balance sheet credit equivalent amount for a participation interest in a financial guarantee-type standby
letter of credit, a guarantee or other guarantee-type is calculated as follows: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(A) Determine the on-balance credit sheet equivalent amount as if the savings association held all of interests in
the participation. See paragraph (a)(3)(ii) of this section (direct credit substitute in the first loss position)
and paragraph (a)(3)(iii) of this section (direct credit substitute in the second loss position). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(B) Multiply the on-balance sheet credit equivalent amount determined under paragraph (a)(3)(iv)(A) of this section
by the percentage of the savings association's participation interest. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(C) If the savings association is exposed to more than its pro rata share of the risk of loss on the direct credit substitute
(
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
e.g.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, the savings association remains secondarily liable on participations held by others), add to the amount computed
under paragraph (a)(3)(iv)(B) of this section, an amount computed as follows: multiply the amount computed under
paragraph (a)(3)(iv)(A) of this section, by the percent of the direct credit substitute held by others and the multiply
the result by the risk weight appropriate for other holders of those interest. (Note: This risk-weighting is in addition
to the risk-weighting done to convert the on-balance sheet credit equivalent amount to the risk-weighted asset amount
under paragraph (a)(3)(i) of this section.)

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Related on-balance sheet assets.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 To the extent that an asset is included in the calculation of the capital requirement for a recourse arrangement or
direct credit substitute under this paragraph (a)(3), and may also be included as an on-balance sheet asset under
paragraph (a)(1) of this section, the asset shall be risk-weighted only under this paragraph (a)(3) except: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(A) Excess mortgage servicing rights that are recourse arrangements, and purchased mortgage servicing rights and
purchased credit card relationships that are direct credit substitutes are risk weighted as on-balance sheet assets
under paragraph (a)(1) of this section, and the related recourse arrangements and direct credit substitutes are
risk weighted under this paragraph (a)(3). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(B) Purchased subordinated interests that are high quality mortgage-related securities are not subject to risk-weighting
under this paragraph (a)(3). Rather, these assets are risk weighted as on-balance sheet assets under paragraph (a)(1)(ii)(H)
of this section.

Low-level exposure.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 If the maximum contractual liability or exposure to loss retained or assumed by a savings association in connection
with a recourse arrangement or direct credit substitute is less than the capital required to support the recourse
obligation or direct credit substitute, the capital requirement is limited to the maximum contractual liability
or exposure to loss. For assets sold with recourse, the amount of capital required to support the recourse obligation
is limited to the maximum contractual liability or exposure to loss less the amount of the recourse liability account
established in accordance with GAAP standards.

 If a savings association holds a mortgage related security or a participation certificate as a result of a mortgage
loan swap with recourse, capital is required to support that percentage of the mortgage related security or participation
certificate that is not covered by the recourse obligation, and the recourse obligation. The total amount of capital
required for the on-balance sheet asset and the recourse obligation, however, is limited to the capital requirement
for the underlying loans, calculated as if the savings association continued to hold these loans as an on-balance
sheet asset.

investment in the subsidiary under GAAP standards, the face amount of the recourse obligation or direct credit substitute
is deducted from capital under &sect;&sect;567.5(a)(2) and 567.9(c). All other recourse obligations and direct
credit substitutes retained or assumed by a savings association on the obligations of a subsidiary are risk-weighted
in accordance with paragraphs (a)(3) (i) through (vi) of this section.

<SUMMARY>
<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 -->
SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS) is proposing to amend the Federal meat and poultry products inspection
regulations by proposing requirements for permitting the use of health claims that characterize the relationship
of a substance (food or food component) to a disease or health-related condition on the labeling of meat and poultry
products. FSIS is also proposing regulations establishing a labeling application process for such health claims.
This proposal would permit health claims relating to the association between: (1) Adequate calcium intake and reduced
risk of osteoporosis; (2) diets low in fat and reduced risk of cancer; (3) sodium reduction and reduced risk of high
blood pressure; (4) reduction in dietary saturated fat and cholesterol and reduced risk of coronary heart disease;
(5) diets low in fat and high in fiber-containing grain products, fruits, and vegetables and reduced risk of cancer;
(6) diets low in saturated fat and cholesterol and high in fruits, vegetables, and grain products that contain dietary
fiber and reduced risk of coronary heart disease; (7) substances in diets low in fat and high in fruits and vegetables
(foods that are low in fat and may contain dietary fiber, vitamin A, or vitamin C) and reduced risk of cancer; and, (8)
folate and reduced risk of neural tube birth defects. FSIS is taking this action to provide consumers with accurate,
informative labeling on meat and poultry products that conforms with such labeling on other foods. FSIS is proposing
regulations to permit health claims that are designed to parallel those issued by the Food and Drug Administration
(FDA) for other foods.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This proposed rule has been reviewed under Executive Order 12866.

Executive Order 12778 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This proposed rule has been reviewed under Executive Order 12778, Civil Justice Reform. States and local jurisdictions
are preempted under the Federal Meat Inspection Act (FMIA) and the Poultry Products Inspection Act (PPIA) from imposing
any marking, labeling, packaging, or ingredient requirement on federally inspected meat and poultry products that
are in addition to, or different than, those imposed under the FMIA or PPIA. States and local jurisdictions may, however,
exercise concurrent jurisdiction over meat and poultry products that are outside official establishments for the
purpose of preventing the distribution of meat and poultry products that are misbranded or adulterated under the
FMIA or PPIA, or, in the case of imported articles, which are not at such an establishment, after their entry into the
United States. Under the FMIA and PPIA, States that maintain meat and poultry inspection programs must impose requirements
that are at least equal to those required under the FMIA and PPIA. The States may, however, impose more stringent requirements
on such State inspected products and establishments. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
No retroactive effect will be given to this proposed rule. The administrative procedures specified in 9 CFR 306.5
and 381.35 must be exhausted prior to any judicial challenge of the application of the provisions of this proposed
rule, if the challenge involves any decision of an inspector relating to inspection services provided under the FMIA
or PPIA. The administrative procedures specified in 9 CFR parts 335 and 381, subpart W, must be exhausted prior to any
judicial challenge of the application of the provisions of this proposed rule with respect to labeling decisions.

Effect on Small Entities 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Administrator has determined that this proposed rule would not have a significant effect on small entities, as
defined by the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601). The proposed regulation would permit the use of health claims
on the labeling of meat and poultry products. Small meat and poultry establishments are exempt from nutrition labeling,
provided the labeling of their products bears no nutrition claims or nutrition information. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
However, small entities with products that currently bear labeling that FSIS is proposing to regulate as a health
claim, e.g. labeling bearing claims that are implied health claims under FSIS's proposed definition of health claim,
may be adversely affected by this regulation. Such labeling would need to be changed to conform to the health claims
regulations. FSIS believes that the number of small firms with products bearing such labeling would not be substantial
because FSIS's current labeling policy does not permit health-related claims which specifically relate foods or
food components to diseases. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Small manufacturers opting to use health claims on their labeling, as proposed by this regulation, would be required
to comply with the nutrition labeling requirements, thereby, incurring the costs associated with such compliance.
However, the use of health claims on the labeling would be voluntary. Decisions by individual manufacturers on whether
to use such health claims on their product labeling would be based on their conclusions that the benefits would outweigh
the costs of including such health claims on the labeling.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This proposed rule would specify the health claims that would be permitted to be used on the labeling of meat and poultry
products. The proposal would also establish a labeling application process whereby any interested person may submit
a labeling application to FSIS for approval of the use of a health claim not provided for in 9 CFR 317.371 and 381.471.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed labeling application process would require any such labeling application to be submitted in a specific
format and accompanied by the following information: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) An explanation of how the substance conforms to the requirements of 9 CFR 317.314 and 381.414, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) A summary of scientific data justifying the connection of the health claim to the health benefit; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Analytical data that show the amount of the substance that is present in product candidates for the use of the proposed
health claim, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) A model health claim; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5) Copies of all information supporting the use of the proposed health claim. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The paperwork requirements contained in this proposal have been submitted to the Office of Management and Budget
for approval under the Paperwork Reduction Act (44 U.S.C. 3501

Background 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Federal Meat Inspection Act (FMIA) (21 U.S.C. 601 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et seq.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
) and the Poultry Products Inspection Act (PPIA) (21 U.S.C. 451 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et seq.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
) authorize the Secretary of Agriculture to establish and maintain inspection programs designed to assure consumers
that meat and poultry products distributed to them (including imports) are wholesome, not adulterated, and are properly
marked, labeled, and packaged. FSIS's authority to require nutrition labeling on meat and poultry products is based
upon the statutory provisions on misbranding in the FMIA and PPIA (21 U.S.C. 601(n)(1), (6), (10), and (12) for the
FMIA and 21 U.S.C. 453(h)(1), (6), (10), and (12) for the PPIA), and the general rulemaking provisions of these Acts
(21 U.S.C. 621 and 453, respectively). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Based upon the Secretary of Agriculture's belief that meat or poultry product labeling would be false or misleading
without nutrition information, FSIS published final regulations on nutrition labeling in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 on January 6, 1993 (58 FR 632). Corrections and technical amendments to the final regulations were published on August
18, 1993 (58 FR 43787), and September 10, 1993 (58 FR 47624), respectively. The final regulations permit voluntary
nutrition labeling on single-ingredient, raw meat and poultry products and establishes mandatory nutrition labeling
for all other meat and poultry products, with certain exceptions. The final regulations parallel to the maximum extent
possible FDA's nutrition labeling regulations promulgated under the Nutrition Labeling and Education Act of 1990
(NLEA).

NLEA Provisions 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The NLEA (Pub. L. 101&hyph;535) requires mandatory nutrition labeling for most FDA-regulated packaged food products.
The NLEA addresses health claims by amending the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act to specify, in part, that a food
is misbranded if it bears a claim that expressly or by implication characterizes the relationship of certain nutrients
to a disease or health-related condition unless the claim is made in accordance with a regulation authorizing its
use. FDA is directed by the NLEA to adopt health claim regulations to describe the relationship between the nutrient
and the disease or health-related condition, and the significance of the nutrient in affecting the disease or health-related
condition. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The NLEA requires the regulations to prohibit health claims for foods which FDA determines contain any nutrient in
an amount which increases to persons in the general population the risk of a diet-related disease or health condition,
taking into account the significance of the food in the total daily diet. However, the NLEA also provides that FDA may
by regulation permit such a claim based on a finding that it would assist consumers in maintaining healthy dietary
practices, and based on a requirement that the label or labeling disclose the presence of the nutrient in conjunction
with the claim. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
To assure the validity of health claims, the NLEA requires that such claims be supported by a sound body of scientific
evidence that establishes the relationship between a food or food component and a particular disease or health-related
condition. The data must clearly demonstrate that the proposed claim is valid, and that the benefits featured in the
claim pertain to the general U.S. population or to an identified U.S. population subgroup, e.g., the elderly. A few
unconfirmed studies, preliminary or incompletely documented data, or significantly contradictory findings do
not constitute a sound body of evidence. In addition, the NLEA requires that significant agreement exists among qualified
experts that the claim is valid. ``Qualified experts'' include individuals whose training and experience have produced
a general or specific scientific expertise in the diet/health topic being considered for a specific claim.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
FSIS does not permit health claims explicitly linking foods or food components to diet-related diseases or health
conditions. FSIS does permit statements informing consumers that a food can be part of a specific dietary pattern
to meet an organization's dietary guidelines or that a product was developed to help consumers follow a specific dietary
pattern. The rationale adopted by FSIS for approving such statements is to encourage labeling which supplements
the information contained in the nutrition label with information that provides truthful data about a product's
nutritional characteristics, and provides generally accepted information about how a product satisfies consumers'
total dietary requirements. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
To implement the use of health-related claims on labeling, FSIS provides general guidelines and objectives which
permit statements if they are based on a consensus of medical and scientific information, emphasize that good nutrition
is a function of the total diet, and are reasonably uniform from product to product. The following is an example of a
health-related claim that would be permitted currently:

 on April 2, 1991 (56 FR 13564), advising of its intent to publish a proposed rule on nutrition labeling. In regard to
health claims, FSIS stated that it expected to adopt the health claim policies established by FDA, as appropriate,
to meet the needs of meat and poultry products. In its proposed regulations on nutrition labeling published in the

 on November 27, 1991 (56 FR 60302), and in its final nutrition labeling regulations, FSIS reiterated its intent to
publish a proposed regulation on health claims in line with FDA's policies. At the time FSIS's final nutrition labeling
regulations were published, the health claims issue was still under study by FSIS.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Most of the comments received in response to the ANPR regarding health claims addressed the need for these types of
claims to inform and remind consumers about the relationship between diet and health. The comments stressed that
such claims must be supported by strong scientific consensus. Commenters also emphasized the importance of working
with FDA to bring about uniformity in health claims regulations so that health messages may be of substantial use to
consumers.

Alternative Considered 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In developing this proposed rule, FSIS considered an alternative to improve the efficiency of establishing regulations
to permit health claims on the labeling of meat and poultry products. Under the alternative, FSIS would not issue regulations
to authorize the use of health claims, but, rather, would permit health claims that are authorized by FDA. In approving
labeling applications, FSIS would refer to FDA regulations to specify the conditions under which health claims may
be used on the labeling of products under USDA inspection. FSIS relied heavily on FDA's decisions about the validity
and significance of the relationship between the substances and diseases that are subjects of this proposal, and
would continue to do so for future claims. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Because health claims are diet-related, FSIS believes they are invariably applicable to food products regulated
by both FSIS and FDA. Many foods from different food categories can be used alone or as ingredients in other products;
for example, as components of meals containing fish, meat, or poultry. FSIS is interested in receiving comments on
the alternative approach it considered. Comments should address the impact such an alternative might have on the
use of health claims on meat and poultry products, and what other actions FSIS should take to ensure that health claims
and criteria for their use are compatible for all food products. Such comments will be given serious consideration
in FSIS's decision on a final rule for health claims.

FDA Health Claims Regulations 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In response to the provisions of the NLEA that bear on health claims, FDA adopted general requirements for such claims
in a final regulation published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 on January 6, 1993 (58 FR 2478). FDA's approach to establish general requirements in conformity to the NLEA provisions
is detailed in its proposed regulation on this subject published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 on November 27, 1991 (56 FR 60537). Among other things, the regulation FDA adopted at 21 CFR 101.14 defines a health
claim, including implied claims, and disqualifying nutrient levels for total fat, saturated fat, cholesterol,
or sodium. The regulation prohibits health claims on the label or in labeling for a food that exceeds any one of the disqualifying
nutrient levels, unless an exception is made under a specific provision authorizing a health claim. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As provided in 21 CFR 101.14, when a health claim is made about the effects of consuming a substance at decreased levels,
the substance in the food bearing the claim must meet a regulatory definition for ``low,'' unless an alternative level
is established in the specific regulation authorizing the claim. If the claim is about the effects of consuming a substance
at other than decreased levels, the level of the substance must be sufficiently high to justify the claim. The regulation
also prohibits health claims for any food that contains less than 10 percent of the Reference Daily Intake or Daily
Reference Value for vitamin A, vitamin C, iron, calcium, protein, or fiber per reference amount customarily consumed
prior to any nutrient addition. Health claims are not allowed for foods when a substance, other than one for which a
disqualifying nutrient level is established, is present at an inappropriate level as set forth in a specific provision
authorizing a claim. Also, health claims are not allowed on foods for children less than 2 years of age unless they are
specifically provided for by regulation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As mandated by the NLEA, FDA evaluated relationships associating nutrients with disease or health-related conditions
with respect to their appropriateness for health claims. The results of the evaluation and detailed discussion on
each relationship, including the materials (studies, publications, etc.) to evaluate their validity, and the conditions
of their use are contained in proposed regulations published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 on November 21, 1991 (56 FR 60566 through 60855), and final regulations published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

 on January 6, 1993 (58 FR 2537, 2552, 2622, 2665, 2739, 2787, and 2820). FDA's final regulations were developed in accordance
with the general requirements contained in 21 CFR 101.14, and authorize seven health claims to describe the following
associations: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Calcium and osteoporosis, (58 FR 2665); 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5) Fiber-containing grain products, fruits, and vegetables and cancer, (58 FR 2537); 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(6) Fruits, vegetables, and grain products that contain fiber, particularly soluble fiber, and risk of coronary
heart disease, (58 FR 2552); and

More recently, FDA published a proposed rule in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 on October 14, 1993 (58 FR 53254), to authorize the use of a health claim about the relationship between folate and neural
tube defects. On January 4, 1994, FDA published a notice in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (59 FR 433) that the proposed regulation is considered a final regulation for dietary supplements. FDA advises that
it has no intention of taking action against foods in conventional form that are naturally high in folate that bear
a claim about this nutrient-disease relationship so long as the claim complies with the provisions of 21 CFR 101.79
that have become final for dietary supplements by operation of law. However, FDA strongly discourages use of the claim
on foods fortified with folic acid until it finalizes the October 14, 1993, proposal.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In reaching its decision regarding the health claims, FDA reviewed the conclusions of many Federal government consensus
documents, Life Sciences Research Office reports, and recent scientific articles. In addition, it considered all
comments received in response to its proposed rules. Among the scientific evidence reviewed were the Department
of Health and Human Services (DHHS) publication ``The Surgeon General's Report on Nutrition and Health,'' U.S. Government
Printing Office, Washington, DC, 1988; the USDA and DHHS publication ``Nutrition and Your Health: Dietary Guidelines
for Americans,'' 3rd ed., Home and Garden Bulletin No. 232, U.S. Government Printing Office, Washington DC, 1990;
and the DHHS publication ``The Lipid Research Clinics Population Studies Data Book,'' vol. II, ``The Prevalence
Study-Nutrient Intake,'' NIH Publication No. 82&hyph;2014, 1982. Also considered were reports of recognized non-governmental
scientific bodies that bear on these topics. These included the Committee on Diet and Health, Food and Nutrition Board,
Commission of Life Sciences, National Research Council's ``Diet and Health: Implications for Reducing Chronic
Disease Risk,'' National Academy Press, Washington, DC, 1989, and the World Health Organization's ``Diet, Nutrition,
the Prevention of Chronic Diseases,'' Technical Report Series 797, 1990, and the Subcommittee on the Tenth Edition
of the RDAs, Food and Nutrition Board, Commission on Life Sciences, National Research Council's ``Recommended Dietary
Allowances,'' National Academy Press, Washington, DC, 1989.

1. Calcium and Osteoporosis 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Based on significant scientific evidence and overwhelming concurrence among experts in this area, FDA authorizes
a health claim relating to an association between adequate calcium intake and osteoporosis on the labels and labeling
of products that meet the regulatory specifications set forth in 21 CFR 101.72. The health claim will relay the message
that an adequate intake of calcium throughout life may delay the development of osteoporosis, and ultimately reduce
the risk of bone fracture in some individuals later in life. Adequate calcium intake levels for the healthy population
as established by the Subcommittee on the Tenth Edition of the RDAs, Food and Nutrition Board, Commission on Life Sciences,
National Research Council are: 800 milligrams per day for males and females 25 years of age and older, 1,200 milligrams
per day for males and females 11 to 24 years of age, and 800 milligrams per day for children (1 to 10 years). By definition,
RDAs are the levels of intakes of essential nutrients that, on the basis of scientific knowledge, are judged by the
Food and Nutrition Board to be adequate to meet the known nutrient needs of practically all healthy persons. To bear
this claim, a product must be high in calcium (i.e., contain a minimum of 20 percent of the Reference Daily Intake of
1,000 milligrams adopted for nutrition labeling, which is 200 milligrams per reference amount customarily consumed
for the product).

2. Dietary Lipids and Cancer 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
FDA concludes that all publicly available information and authoritative reports support an association between
diets low in fat and risk of some types of cancer. Based on this evidence, FDA authorizes the use of claims relating fat
reduction to reduced risk of some cancers provided that such statements comply with the requirements of 21 CFR 101.73.
The claim would convey the message that diets low in fat may reduce the risk of some types of cancer. The message may not
refer to specific sites of cancer and may not specify types of fat or fatty acids that may be related to the risk of cancer
because of the inconclusiveness of the relevant scientific evidence on these issues. FDA limits this claim to low
fat products, except that fish and game meats may be extra lean.

3. Sodium and Hypertension 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
FDA finds significant scientific agreement that claims relating sodium reduction to reduced risk of high blood pressure
are justified. The scientific evidence shows diets high in sodium are associated with a high prevalence of hypertension
and with increases in blood pressure with age, and that diets low in sodium are associated with a low prevalence of hypertension
and with a low or no increase of blood pressure with age. Therefore, FDA authorizes in 21 CFR 101.74 claims on the relationship
of dietary sodium and high blood pressure on food labels and labeling. Only food products low in sodium are eligible
to carry this claim.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Coronary heart disease (CHD) is the most common and serious form of cardiovascular disease. High blood total- and
low density lipoprotein (LDL)-cholesterol levels are major risk factors in the development of CHD. FDA concludes
that the totality of a large body of scientific evidence provides strong and consistent support that diets high in
saturated fat and cholesterol are associated with increased levels of blood total- and LDL-cholesterol and, thus,
with increased risk of CHD. Based on this conclusion, FDA authorizes claims on foods relating the reduction in dietary
saturated fat and cholesterol to reduced risk of CHD when provided in accordance with the requirements of 21 CFR 101.75.
The requirements limit this claim to products that are low in fat, low in saturated fat, and low in cholesterol, except
that fish and game meats may be extra lean.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
FDA concludes that publicly available scientific evidence indicates that diets low in fat and rich in fiber-containing
grain products, fruits, and vegetables are associated with a decreased risk of some types of cancer. While there is
significant scientific agreement that evidence supports this association, the specific role of total dietary fiber,
fiber components, and other nutrients and substances in these foods in reducing cancer risk is not fully understood.
Based on the evidence, FDA authorizes a health claim in 21 CFR 101.76 relating diets low in fat and high in fiber-containing
grain products, fruits, and vegetables to reduced risk of some cancers. The message may include a reference to dietary
fiber in a statement about the value of grain products, fruits, and vegetables in reducing cancer risk because fiber
is an identifying marker of the types of foods correlated with the risk reduction. Only low fat products may convey
this claim.

Disease
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
On the basis of scientific evidence, including recent evidence, FDA finds support for a claim associating diets low
in saturated fat and cholesterol and high in fruits, vegetables (including legumes), and grain products, foods that
are low in saturated fat and cholesterol and are good sources of dietary fiber, to reduced risk of heart disease. In
authorizing this claim in 21 CFR 101.77, FDA permits the message about the value of these foods to include reference
to dietary fiber and specifies a qualifying criterion for soluble fiber content in the food product bearing the claim.
Other qualifying criteria limit fat, saturated fat, and cholesterol to low levels in the product. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

7. Fruits and Vegetables and Cancer 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
FDA concludes that the evidence is not sufficient to attribute reduction in risk of some types of cancer specifically
to vitamin A as 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
beta
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
-carotene, vitamin C, or vitamin E, alone or in combination, or to other components of diets low in fat and high in fruits
and vegetables. However, the evidence does indicate that diets rich in fruits and vegetables, which are generally
low in fat and high in vitamin A as 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
beta
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
-carotene, vitamin C, and dietary fiber, are associated with decreased risk. Therefore, FDA authorizes a health
claim relating substances in diets low in fat and high in fruits and vegetables to a reduced risk of cancer. The message
must characterize fruits and vegetables as foods that are low in fat and contribute vitamins A and C and dietary fiber
to the diet. Any product displaying this claim must have a low fat content.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
After reviewing new scientific data, public comments, and recommendations provided by the Folic Acid Subcommittee
of its Food Advisory Committee, FDA has proposed to authorize a health claim for folate and neural tube defects. These
serious birth defects include anencephaly and spina bifida and, although rare, can result in infant mortality or
serious disability. According to proposed 21 CFR 101.79, the claim would specify that women who are capable of becoming
pregnant and who consume adequate amounts of folate daily during their childbearing years may reduce their risk of
having a pregnancy affected by neural tube defects. To bear this proposed claim, a food would need to be a good source
of folate.

FSIS Proposal
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
FSIS agrees with FDA that Congress enacted the health claims provisions of the NLEA to help U.S. consumers maintain
healthy dietary practices and to protect these consumers from unfounded health claims. As mentioned previously,
FSIS regulates the labeling of meat and poultry products, and has statutory authority to determine that an article
is misbranded if it is false or misleading in any particular. FSIS is proposing regulatory health claims because of
the potential that health claims may be false or misleading to consumers.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FSIS has evaluated FDA's proposed and final regulations for health claims, and has concluded to propose parallel
regulations for meat and poultry products. Based on review of the scientific evidence, FSIS is proposing to authorize
the use of health claims relating to the association between: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Adequate calcium intake and reduced risk of osteoporosis; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Diets low in fat and reduced risk of cancer; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Sodium reduction and reduced risk of high blood pressure; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) Reduction in dietary saturated fat and cholesterol and reduced risk of coronary heart disease; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5) Diets low in fat and high in fiber-containing grain products, fruits, and vegetables and reduced risk of cancer;

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(6) Diets low in saturated fat and cholesterol and high in fruits, vegetables, and grain products that contain dietary
fiber and reduced risk of coronary heart disease; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(7) Substances in diets low in fat and high in fruits and vegetables (foods that are low in fat and may contain dietary
fiber, vitamin A, or vitamin C) and reduced risk of cancer; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(8) Folate and reduced risk of neural tube birth defects.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Administrator of FSIS believes that the use of these health claims on the labeling of meat and poultry products
would not be false or misleading. Although FSIS agrees with FDA that there is significant scientific agreement among
qualified experts to support the use of these health claims for the reasons cited in FDA's proposed regulations published
November 27, 1991 (56 FR 60537), final regulations published January 6, 1993 (58 FR 2478), and proposed regulations
published October 14, 1993 (58 FR 53254), FSIS is requesting comments on the use of these claims.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As noted previously, the NLEA establishes two distinct components to assure the validity of health claims_a body
of evidence component and a review component that there be significant scientific agreement about the support for
the claim. FDA chose not to define ``significant scientific agreement'' among experts because each situation may
differ with the nature of the claimed substance/disease relationship. The evaluation of scientific evidence and
opinions about that evidence may be somewhat subjective, and not every expert in the field would be expected to approve
or agree with a claim. In deciding whether significant agreement exists, it is necessary to consider both the extent
of agreement and nature of the disagreement on a case-by-case basis. If agreement were assessed under inflexible
criteria, some valid claims could be disallowed where disagreement is not persuasive. FSIS proposes to use the same
flexible approach adopted by FDA in assessing significant scientific agreement about the validity of health of health
claims.

Definition of Health Claim
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
FSIS concurs with FDA's definition of a health claim and, accordingly, is proposing to define a health claim as any
claim made on the label or in labeling of a meat or poultry product that expressly or by implication, including third
party references, written statements (e.g., a brand name including a term such as ``heart''), symbols (e.g., a heart
symbol), or vignettes, characterizes the relationship of any substance to a disease or health-related condition.
Implied health claims would include those statements, symbols, vignettes, or other forms of communication that
suggest, within the context in which they are presented, that a relationship exists between the presence or level
of a substance in the meat or poultry product and a disease or health-related condition. FSIS is proposing to permit
express or implied health claims on the labeling of meat or poultry products if the claim is specifically provided
for in proposed 9 CFR 317.371 and 381.471 for meat and poultry products, respectively.

FSIS views third party endorsements on product labeling as references, made through a name or logo, to an organization
such as a professional society or association that is independent of the product's manufacturer or distributor,
to promote that organization's approval of a product. If the name of an endorsing organization references a particular
disease and the endorsement references a particular food or nutrient, a third party endorsement would constitute
an implied health claim. While third party references often include general information about dietary recommendations
or good nutrition, FSIS is proposing that they be regulated as a health claim if they characterize the relationship
of a substance to a disease or health-related condition. FSIS believes that it would not be misleading to include such
references on food labeling provided such statements are made in a manner that is in compliance with all applicable
provisions of proposed 9 CFR 317.314, 317.371, 381.414, and 381.471.

Disqualifying Nutrient Levels 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
FSIS is proposing to adopt the disqualifying nutrient levels defined by FDA at 21 CFR 101.14(a)(5) with minor modifications.
FDA defines disqualifying levels at 21 CFR 101.14(a)(5) for total fat, saturated fat, cholesterol, or sodium for
individual foods as 13.0 grams (g) of fat, 4.0 g of saturated fat, 60 milligrams (mg) of cholesterol, or 480 mg of sodium
per reference amount customarily consumed, per label serving size, and, only for foods with reference amounts customarily
consumed of 30 g or less or 2 tablespoons or less, per 50 g. The levels for a main dish product, as defined in 21 CFR 101.13(m)
and that weighs at least 6 ounces, are defined as 19.5 g of fat, 6.0 g of saturated fat, 90 mg of cholesterol or 720 mg of
sodium per label serving size. The levels for a meal product, as defined in 21 CFR 101.13(l) and that weighs at least
10 ounces per labeled serving, are defined as 26.0 g of fat, 8.0 g of saturated fat, 120 mg of cholesterol, or 960 mg of
sodium per label serving size. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FDA's disqualifying levels for total fat, saturated fat, cholesterol, or sodium represent 20, 30, and 40 percent
of the Daily Reference Value established for each nutrient for individual foods, main dish products, and meal products,
respectively. FSIS believes these levels are appropriate to meet the intent of the NLEA requirement that health claims
be prohibited for foods that, taking into account the makeup of the total daily diet, increase the risk of diet-related
diseases or health conditions for persons in the general population. In setting these levels, FSIS agrees with FDA
that risk not be considered in terms of the impact of consuming a particular food, but, rather, in terms of the role a
food plays in the total diet, and the effects its nutrient levels have on a person's ability to construct a healthy diet.
Consistent with FDA's general requirements for health claims on labeling of products under its jurisdiction, FSIS
is proposing that any one of the levels would disqualify a meat or poultry product from bearing a health claim, unless
an exception is provided under a specific provision authorizing a health claim. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The disqualifying levels set by FDA for total fat and saturated fat are expressed to one-tenth of a gram. FSIS's nutrition
labeling regulations require that fat and saturated fat be declared in labeling in half-gram increments below 3 g
per serving and to the nearest gram above 3 g. FSIS intends to amend its regulations to change the 3 g to 5 g in a proposed
regulation on technical amendments to be published in the near future. FSIS established the reporting increments
taking into account the adequacy of analytical methods for determining fat and fatty acids in food products. FSIS
is concerned that method precision and natural variations in fat content in foods are such that measurements cannot
be made reliably at higher fat contents to support disqualifying levels with the degree of accuracy implied by levels
set at one-tenth of a gram. Accordingly, FSIS is proposing to adopt disqualifying levels for fat and saturated fat
expressed at increments required for labeling declarations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For purposes of making a nutrient content claim, FSIS defines a meal-type product at 9 CFR 317.313(l) and 381.413(l),
in part, as a product that weighs at least 6 ounces, but no more than 12 ounces per serving (container). Meal-type products
weighing more than 12 ounces are evaluated for use of nutrient content claims on a case-by-case basis when labels are
submitted for prior approval. In its final rule on nutrition labeling, FSIS stated that it believes the majority of
meal-type products fall under its purview, and that 78.7 percent of frozen dinners (6.0 to 24.0 ounces) fall between
6 ounces and 12 ounces. FSIS concludes that its definition of meal-type product encompasses the types of products
that FDA defines as main dish products and meal products. To provide consistency with FDA's requirements for health
claims on these types of products, FSIS is proposing to apply FDA's disqualifying levels for main dish products to
FSIS-regulated meal products weighing at least 6 ounces, but less than 10 ounces, and FDA's disqualifying levels
for meal products to FSIS-regulated meal products weighing 10 ounces or more, including those weighing more than
12 ounces. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FSIS does not believe that FDA's cholesterol disqualifying level of 90 mg per label serving for main dish products
differs measurably from the cholesterol criterion of less than 95 mg per 100 g and labeled serving for ``lean'' and
``extra lean'' claims on meal-type products at 9 CFR 317.362(c) and 381.462(c) when taking into account that cholesterol
is declared in labeling to the nearest 5 mg per serving. Because FSIS requires a minimum weight of 6 ounces (170 g) for
a meal-type product, the labeled-serving basis becomes the limiting basis. Regardless of its weight, an entire meal-type
product must contain less than 95 mg of cholesterol to qualify to use ``lean'' or ``extra lean'' claims. For these reasons,
FSIS concludes that raising the cholesterol disqualifying level from 90 to 95 mg per labeled serving for meal-type
products weighing at least 6 ounces, but less than 10 ounces, is warranted. This action would provide greater consistency
in qualifying criteria for health claims and nutrient content claims on meal-type products in the weight range of
6 ounces up to 10 ounces.

Substances Consumed at Decreased Levels 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
FSIS is proposing to adopt FDA's policy that, when a health claim is made about the effects of consuming a substance
at decreased dietary levels, the substance must be a nutrient that meets ``low'' requirements in the food to justify
the claim. To meet ``low'' requirements, FDA requires that the nutrient must meet a regulatory definition for ``low,''
or a specific level established for the nutrient in the regulation authorizing the claim. Of the eight health claims,
FSIS is proposing to authorize six concern effects of consuming nutrients at decreased levels, i.e., the claim related
to hypertension, the three claims related to cancer, and the two claims related to coronary heart disease. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Scientific evidence discussed previously shows that dietary sodium is associated with hypertension, and that total
fat intake provides the strongest dietary association with cancer. Also, saturated fat and cholesterol in diets
are the major dietary risk factors for heart disease, while total fat in diets affects the risk indirectly through
effects on obesity and reduction of intake of saturated fat and cholesterol. FSIS is proposing that health claims
associating diets with risk of hypertension, cancer, and coronary heart disease may only be made on the labeling of
meat and poultry products that meet the following requirements: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) To bear the proposed claim about hypertension, a product must meet the nutrient content requirements for a ``low
sodium'' claim at 9 CFR 317.361 and 381.461; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) To bear the proposed claims about cancer, a product must meet the nutrient content requirements for a ``low fat''
claim at 9 CFR 317.362 and 381.462; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) To bear the proposed claims about coronary heart disease, a product must meet the nutrient content requirements
for claims for ``low fat,'' ``low saturated fat,'' and ``low cholesterol'' at 9 CFR 317.362 and 381.462. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In response to comments on its proposed rules about lipids and cancer and lipids and cardiovascular disease, FDA provides
in its final regulations on dietary lipids and cancer and on dietary saturated fat and cholesterol and risk of coronary
heart disease that these claims may be made on fish and game meats that meet the requirements for ``extra lean'' in 21
CFR 101.62. FSIS agrees with FDA that, without such alternative qualifying criteria, many meat, poultry, and fish
products would be prohibited from bearing health claims. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FSIS has examined the nutritional values for meat and poultry products reported in USDA's Agriculture Handbook No.
8 and concludes that no single-ingredient cut of beef, pork, or lamb can meet the criteria for ``low fat'' or ``low saturated
fat'' or the disqualifying level for cholesterol. While skinless chicken breast meat does meet ``low fat'' and ``low
saturated fat'' criteria, its cholesterol content exceeds the disqualifying level. Of the products examined, only
skinless light meat turkey meets all three requirements. Meat and poultry products that are individual foods and
that meet the ``low fat'' and ``low saturated fat'' criteria, as well as the disqualifying level for cholesterol,
tend to be those that contain lesser amounts of meat or poultry, such as soups, or have 55-gram reference amounts and
are cured or have added water or other ingredients, such as certain luncheon products. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Many recommendations from public health organizations and authorities and the Dietary Guidelines for Americans
advise choosing lean meats, fish, and poultry without skin as a means of achieving nutritious diets low in fat, saturated
fat, and cholesterol. To preclude health claims on many of these products may obstruct the dietary guidance goals
of encouraging consumption of a variety of foods and increased selection of lean meats and poultry by consumers. Meat
and poultry products play an important role in the U.S. dietary pattern because they are consumed by most Americans
on a daily basis and provide protein, B-vitamins, and essential minerals, such as iron and zinc. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FSIS regulatory definition for ``extra lean'' may be used on the label or in labeling of a meat or poultry product
when the product contains less than 5 g of fat, less than 2 g of saturated fat, and less than 95 mg of cholesterol per 100
g and reference amount customarily consumed for individual foods and per 100 g and labeled serving size for meal-type
products. For individual foods, the 100-gram density criterion controls qualification for the claim when reference
amounts are below 100 g. For example, products such as cooked meat or poultry cuts with a reference amount of 85 g meet
``extra lean'' requirements only when 85 g of the products contain less than 4.3 g of fat, 1.7 g of saturated fat, and
81 mg of cholesterol. Products such as luncheon meats or poultry lunch products with a reference amount of 55 g meet
the requirements only when 55 g of the products contain less than 2.8 g of fat, 1.1 g of saturated fat, and 52 mg of cholesterol.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Individual foods with reference amounts exceeding 100 g such as mixed dishes not measurable with a cup having a reference
amount of 140 g may not contain more than 5 g of fat, 2 g of saturated fat, and 95 mg of cholesterol in 140 g of the products
to use ``extra lean'' claims. Meal-type products are restricted to no more than 5 g of fat, 2 g of saturated fat, and 95
mg of cholesterol in the entire serving (container) to carry the claim. FSIS concludes that only individual food products
with reference amounts over about 2 ounces (56 g) would be subject to somewhat less stringent requirements than permitted
by ``low fat'' and ``low saturated fat'' criteria and the disqualifying level for cholesterol if permitted to qualify
for health claims based on requirements for ``extra lean'' claims. FSIS also believes, as stated in its proposed rule
on nutrition labeling, that the ``extra lean'' criteria recognize the practice of dietary planning in which a person
consumes servings of a variety of foods that contain different levels of fat, saturated fat, and cholesterol, and
allow for a diet that will meet the dietary guidelines.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Because FSIS is convinced that it is important to communicate consistent messages about dietary goals, and about
the role meat and poultry products can play in meeting dietary recommendations, it is proposing to provide, as an option,
for meat and poultry products that meet the ``total fat'' and ``cholesterol'' criteria for ``extra lean'' to carry
health claims about cancer, and products that meet all the requirements for the ``extra lean'' claim to carry health
claims about heart disease. Because many meat and poultry products, including individual foods such as mixed dishes
and meal-type products, contain ample amounts of foods from the fruit and vegetable group and/or the grain products
group to be suitable in nature to bear claims about cancer and heart disease, FSIS believes it is appropriate to allow
meat and poultry products meeting ``extra lean'' criteria to qualify for the companion claims about the relationships
of diets high in fruits, vegetables, and grain products to cancer and heart disease. Such action would be consistent
with dietary guidance efforts to encourage healthful diets by choosing diets with plenty of fruits, vegetables,
and grain products, as well as choosing lean meats and poultry.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
To be consistent with the use of ``extra lean'' criteria for health claims about cancer and heart disease, FSIS believes
it is appropriate to permit meat and poultry products that are individual foods to meet the ``extra lean'' cholesterol
criterion to carry the calcium/osteoporosis, sodium/hypertension, and folate/neural tube defects health claims.
To not make this allowance would introduce disparity among meat and poultry products to qualify for all claims. Therefore,
FSIS is proposing to permit meat and poultry products which meet the ``cholesterol'' criterion for ``extra lean''
to carry health claims about osteoporosis, hypertension, and neural tube defects, provided they meet all other requirements
to bear those claims.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FSIS proposes to require that the labeling of a product disclose the presence of any nutrient that exceeds the disqualifying
level in conjunction with a claim when FSIS permits the claim. Therefore, when a claim is allowed on an individual food
despite the fact that its cholesterol level exceeds the disqualifying level, the labeling would be required to carry
a disclosure statement to read ``See [appropriate panel or Nutrition Facts] for information about [nutrient requiring
disclosure] and other nutrients,'' e.g., ``See side panel for information about cholesterol and other nutrients,''
or ``See Nutrition Facts for information about cholesterol and other nutrients.'' This action would be consistent
with FDA's disclosure requirements.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
FSIS agrees with FDA that when claims are made about the effects of consuming a substance at other than decreased levels,
the level of the substance must be sufficiently high to justify the claim. For such claims, FSIS is proposing to adopt
levels required to meet regulatory definitions for ``good source'' or ``high'' prior to any nutrient addition. However,
in defining requirements for nutrient content claims for ``good source'' and ``high'' at 9 CFR 317.354 and 381.454
for meat and poultry products, respectively, FSIS did not provide a specific definition for a meal-type product.
Rather, the claims are allowed for a food contained in a meal-type product based on the reference amount customarily
consumed of the component food. Because the actual serving of a component food, when used as a side dish in a meal, may
be much less than the reference amount, FSIS is concerned that the actual quantitative amount of the substance, e.g.,
calcium or dietary fiber, in the entire meal may not be sufficient to justify use of the claim on the product. To ensure
sufficient levels of substances in a meal-type product, FSIS is proposing to base the qualifying nutrient criteria
on the labeled serving of the entire product.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FSIS believes health claims should not be made on foods that do not make a nutritional contribution to the diet. Therefore,
FSIS is proposing, as a general requirement, to prohibit health claims for any product that contains less than 10 percent
of the Reference Daily Intake or Daily Reference Value for vitamin A, vitamin C, iron, calcium, protein, or fiber per
reference amount customarily consumed prior to any nutrient addition for individual foods and per labeled serving
prior to any nutrient addition for meal-type products. FSIS interprets nutrient addition as addition specifically
to meet the requirements for a health claim. For example, the requirement does not preclude claims on products where
a nutrient is added to meet a standard of identity; a nutrient is added for technological purposes, e.g., L-ascorbic
acid (vitamin C) in curing meats; a non-meat or non-poultry ingredient fortified in accordance with FDA requirements
and policy is used; or, an ingredient that is a nutrient source, e.g., textured vegetable protein, is used.

Additional Limits on Claims
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
FSIS agrees with FDA that claims should be prohibited for any product where a substance, other than one for which a disqualifying
nutrient level is established, is present at an inappropriate level as specified in the provision authorizing the
claim. For example, a product containing more phosphorus than calcium on a weight-per-weight basis would not be eligible
to bear the calcium/osteoporosis health claim because high levels of dietary phosphorus, when calcium intake is
low, would impair the utilization of calcium by bone. The presence of the claim on a product not having an appropriate
calcium to phosphorus ratio would be misleading in that it would not be possible to get the full calcium benefits from
such a product.

FSIS also agrees with FDA that health claims for children less than 2 years of age should be established by specific
regulations providing for their use. Health claims that concern dietary recommendations for the U.S. adult population
are not meant to apply to children less than 2 years of age. For example, the Dietary Guidelines for Americans states
that the guidelines are ``advice for healthy Americans ages 2 years and over_not for younger children and infants
whose dietary needs differ.'' Accordingly, FSIS is proposing to prohibit only those claims on foods for this age group
that are not specifically provided for by regulation. FSIS will consider health claims on these products and, where
appropriate, will establish specific regulations for their use.

Labeling Applications
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
FSIS is proposing to establish a labeling application process whereby interested parties may submit a labeling application
to FSIS for approval of the use of a particular health claim in the labeling of a meat or poultry product. The labeling
application would include: (1) An explanation of how the substance qualifies for a health claim under the requirements
in proposed 9 CFR 317.314 and 381.414; (2) a summary of scientific data providing the basis upon which authorizing
a health claim can be justified as providing a health benefit; (3) analytical data showing the amount of the substance
that is present in the meat or poultry product that would be a candidate to bear the claim; (4) a model health claim that
represents label statements for use on a label or in labeling for a meat or poultry product to characterize the relationship
between the substance to a disease or health-related condition; (5) documentation supporting the summary of scientific
data, including copies of any literature searches done by the applicant and of articles cited in the literature and
other information, such as copies of publications cited in review articles and used to perform the analyses; and (6)
a statement signed by the person responsible for preparing the labeling application that, to the best of his or her
knowledge, it is a representative and balanced submission that includes unfavorable, as well as favorable, information
known to him or her to be pertinent to the evaluation of the proposed health claim. The labeling application would be
required to be signed by the applicant or by the applicant's responsible officer or agent.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Upon receipt and review of the labeling application, FSIS would notify the applicant, in writing, that the labeling
application is either being considered for further review or that it has been denied by the Administrator. If the Administrator
summarily denies the labeling application, he or she would notify the applicant, in writing, as to the reason(s) for
the denial, including why the proposed health claim in the labeling was determined by FSIS to be false or misleading,
and would afford the applicant an opportunity to submit a written statement by way of answer to the notification, and
a right to request a hearing with respect to the merits or validity of the Administrator's decision to deny the use of
the proposed health claim. If the applicant fails to accept the determination of the Administrator and files an answer
and requests a hearing, and the Administrator, after review of the answer, determines the initial determination
to be correct, the Administrator would file with the Hearing Clerk of the Department the notification, answer, and
the request for hearing, which would constitute the complaint and answer in the proceeding, which would thereafter
be conducted in accordance with the Department's Uniform Rules of Practice. The hearing would be conducted before
an administrative law judge with the opportunity for appeal to the Department's Judicial Officer, who is delegated
the authority to make the final determination for the Secretary. Any such determination by the Secretary would be
conclusive unless, within thirty days after receipt of notice of such final determination, the applicant appealed
to the United States Court of Appeals for the circuit in which the applicant has its principal place of business or to
the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If the Administrator does not summarily deny the labeling application, he or she would publish in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 a proposed rule to amend the regulations to authorize the use of the health claim. The proposal would also summarize
the labeling application, including where the supporting documentation could be reviewed. The Administrator's
proposed rule would seek comment from consumers, the industry, consumer and industry groups, medical and scientific
professionals, and other interested persons on the labeling application and the use of the proposed health claim.
FSIS believes that the use of health claims has great overall significance to consumer health. Because of the highly
sensitive nature of such claims and the vast amount of medical and scientific studies which are being conducted in
this area, FSIS believes that the solicitation of comments by the Administrator from the public on whether to approve
the use of a particular health claim would foster an open environment and lead to the most informed and well-supported
decision. After public comment has been received and reviewed by FSIS, the Administrator will make a determination
on whether the proposed health claim will be approved for use on the labeling.

If the claim is denied following the review of the public comments, FSIS would notify the applicant by letter of the
basis for the denial, including the reason why the claim on the labeling was determined by the Administrator to be false
or misleading. The applicant would have the opportunity to appeal this decision by instituting a proceeding that
would be conducted under the same procedures specified above if a labeling application were summarily denied by the
Administrator during the initial review. If the claim is approved by the Administrator, FSIS would notify the applicant
by letter and would also publish in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 a final regulation regarding the approval of the claim. The final regulation would amend the regulations to authorize
the use of the health claim in the labeling of meat and poultry products. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FSIS's proposed labeling application process concerning health claims differs from that of FDA as detailed in 21
CFR 101.70. Although FSIS has attempted to harmonize to the maximum extent possible with FDA in most aspects of nutrition
labeling, FDA's rulemaking process regarding health claims differs from FSIS's statutory authority mandated by
Congress under section 7(e) of the FMIA (21 U.S.C. 607(e) and section 8(d) of the PPIA (21 U.S.C. 457(d)). These statutes
afford applicants whose labeling claims are denied by the Administrator the right to appeal that decision to a Federal
court of appeals. Because of these statutory requirements, the Department has promulgated regulations (9 CFR 335.12,
9 CFR 381.233, and 7 CFR 1.130 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et seq
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
.) that specify the hearing procedures and rules of practice which are used in proceedings before the Secretary under
section 7(e) of the FMIA and section 8(d) of the PPIA. Accordingly, the labeling application process proposed by FSIS
concerning health claims provides applicants with those same rights to a due process administrative hearing if their
claims are denied by the Administrator, and is thereby consistent with FSIS's statutory requirements. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
When the Administrator has determined that a health claim may be used, firms may make claims based on the regulation
provided that: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
6. If the claim is about the effects of consuming the substance at decreased dietary levels, the level of the substance
in the food is sufficiently low to justify the claim, or, if the claim is about the effects of consuming the substance
at other than decreased dietary levels, the level of the substance in the food is sufficiently high to justify the claim.

Because of the nature and complexity of health claims and the consumer's reliance on them in making decisions on food
purchases, FSIS believes it is essential that health claims be conveyed to consumers in an accurate and informative
manner. Therefore, if this proposal is adopted as a final regulation, FSIS would make the final regulation effective
6 months from the date of publication of the final regulation. FSIS believes that this would provide sufficient time
for meat and poultry producers to conform to the new health claim requirements. It is noted, therefore, that the health
claim requirements would not become effective on July 6, 1994, along with the mandatory nutrition labeling regulations.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Disqualifying nutrient levels 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
mean the levels of total fat, saturated fat, cholesterol, or sodium in a meat or meat food product above which the product
will be disqualified from making a health claim. These levels are 13 grams (g) of fat, 4 g of saturated fat, 60 milligrams
(mg) of cholesterol, or 480 mg of sodium per reference amount customarily consumed, per labeled serving size, and,
only for foods with reference amounts customarily consumed of 30 g or less or 2 tablespoons or less, per 50 g. For dehydrated
products that must be reconstituted before typical consumption with water or a diluent containing an insignificant
amount, as defined in &sect;317.309(g)(1), of all nutrients, the per 50-g criterion refers to the prepared form.
Any one of the levels, on a per reference amount customarily consumed, a per labeled serving size or, when applicable,
a per 50-g basis, will disqualify a meat or meat food product from making a health claim unless an exception is provided
for in &sect;317.371, except that: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) The levels for a meal product, as defined in

Disease or health-related condition 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
means damage to an organ, part, structure, or system of the body such that it does not function properly (e.g., cardiovascular
disease), or a state of health leading to such dysfunctioning (e.g., hypertension); except that diseases resulting
from essential nutrient deficiencies (e.g., scurvy, pellagra) are not included in this definition and, thereby,
claims pertaining to such diseases are not subject to &sect;317.314 or &sect;317.370.

(b) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Eligibility. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
For a substance to be eligible for a health claim: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) The substance must be associated with a disease or health-related condition for which the general U.S. population,
or an identified U.S. population subgroup (e.g., the elderly) is at risk, or, alternatively, the labeling application
submitted by the proponent of the claim otherwise explains the prevalence of the disease or health-related condition
in the U.S. population and the relevance of the claim in context of the total daily diet and satisfies the other requirements
of this section. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) If the substance is to be consumed as a component of a meat or meat food product at decreased dietary levels, the substance
must be a nutrient that is required to be included in the label or labeling as set forth in &sect;317.309(b); or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) If the substance is to be consumed at other than decreased dietary levels: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) The substance must contribute taste, aroma, or nutritive value, or any technical effect listed in 21 CFR 170.3(o),
to the food and must retain that attribute when consumed at levels that are necessary to justify a claim; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) The substance must be a food or a food ingredient or a component of a food ingredient whose use at the levels necessary
to justify a claim has been demonstrated by the proponent of the claim to be safe and lawful under the applicable food
safety provisions of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act and the Federal Meat Inspection Act.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Validity requirement. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Administrator will approve the use of a health claim only when he or she determines that the claim is not false or
misleading, because it is supported by: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) The totality of publicly available scientific evidence (including evidence from well-designed studies conducted
in a manner which is consistent with generally recognized scientific procedures and principles); and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Significant scientific agreement among experts qualified by scientific training and experience to evaluate
such claims.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
General health claim labeling requirements.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (1) When the Administrator determines that a health claim meets the requirements of paragraph (c) of this section,
the Agency will notify the applicant, in writing, and will institute rulemaking to amend the regulations to authorize
the use of that claim. If the claim pertains to a substance not provided for in Part 317 of the regulations, the Administrator
will institute rulemaking to amend the regulations to include declaration of the substance. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) When a regulation has been established in this Part providing for a health claim, firms may make claims based on
the regulation in this part; 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Provided,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 That: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) All label or labeling statements about the substance-disease relationship that is the subject of the claim are
based on, and consistent with, the conclusions set forth in &sect;317.371; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) The claim is limited to describing the value that ingestion (or reduced ingestion) of the substance, as part of
a total dietary pattern, may have on a particular disease or health-related condition; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) The claim is otherwise complete, truthful, and not misleading. Where factors other than dietary intake of the
substance affect the relationship between the substance and the disease or health-related condition, such factors
may be required to be addressed in the claim by a specific provision in &sect;317.371; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iv) All information required to be included in the claim appears in one place without other intervening material,
except that the principal display panel of the label or labeling may bear the reference statement, ``See 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=7 f=2 -->
XXX
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 for information about the relationship between 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=7 f=2 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 and 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=7 f=2 -->
XXX
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
,'' with the blanks filled in with the location of the labeling containing the health claim, the name of the substance,
and the disease or health-related condition (e.g., ``See attached pamphlet for information about calcium and osteoporosis''),
with the entire claim appearing elsewhere on the other labeling; 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Provided,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 That, where any graphic material (e.g., a heart symbol) constituting an explicit or implied health claim appears
on the label or labeling, the reference statement or the complete claim shall appear in immediate proximity to such
graphic material; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(v) The claim enables the public to comprehend the information provided and to understand the relative significance
of such information in the context of the total daily diet; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(vi) If the claim is about the effects of consuming the substance at decreased dietary levels, the level of the substance
in the meat or meat food product is sufficiently low to justify the claim. To meet this requirement, if a definition
for use of the term ``low'' has been established for that substance under this Part, the substance must be present at
a level that meets the requirements for use of that term, unless a specific alternative level has been established
for the substance in &sect;317.371. If no definition for ``low'' has been established, the level of the substance
must meet the level established in the regulation authorizing the claim; or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(vii) If the claim is about the effects of consuming the substance at other than decreased dietary levels, the level
of the substance is sufficiently high to justify the claim. To meet this requirement, if a definition for use of the
term ``high'' for that substance has been established under this Part, the substance must be present at a level that
meets the requirements for use of that term, unless a specific alternative level has been established for the substance
in &sect;317.371. If no definition for ``high'' has been established (e.g., where the claim pertains to a food either
as a whole food or as an ingredient in another food), the claim must specify the daily dietary intake necessary to achieve
the claimed effect, as established in the regulation authorizing the claim; 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Provided,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 That, where the meat or meat food product that bears the claim meets the requirements of paragraphs (d)(2)(vi) or (d)(2)(vii)
of this section based on its reference amount customarily consumed, and the labeled serving size differs from that
amount, the claim shall be followed by a statement explaining that the claim is based on the reference amount rather
than the labeled serving size (e.g., ``Diets low in sodium may reduce the risk of high blood pressure, a disease associated
with many factors. A serving 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=7 f=2 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 of ounces of this product conforms to such a diet.'') 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Nutrition labeling shall be provided in the label or labeling of any meat or meat food product for which a health
claim is made in accordance with &sect;317.309.

Prohibited health claims.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 No express or implied health claim may be made on the label or in labeling for a meat or meat food product unless: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) The claim is specifically provided for in &sect;317.371; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) The claim conforms to all general provisions of this section as well as to all specific provisions in the appropriate
section of &sect;317.371; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) None of the disqualifying levels identified in paragraph (a)(4) of this section is exceeded in the meat or meat
food product, unless specific alternative levels have been established for the substance in &sect;317.371; or,
unless the Administrator has permitted a claim despite the fact that a disqualifying level of a nutrient is present
in the product based on a finding that such a claim will assist consumers in maintaining healthy dietary practices,
and, in accordance with the regulation in this part that makes such a finding, the labeling bears a referral statement
disclosing the nutrient(s) that exceeds the disqualifying level as follows: ``See [appropriate panel or Nutrition
Facts] for information about [nutrient requiring disclosure] and other nutrients.'' The statement shall be in easily
legible boldface print or type, in distinct contrast to other printed or graphic matter, that is no less than that required
for net quantity of contents, except where the size of the claim is less than two times the required size of the net quantity
of contents statement, in which case the referral statement shall be no less than one-half the size of the claim but
no smaller than one-sixteenth of an inch. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) Except as provided in paragraph (e)(3) of this section, no substance is present at an inappropriate level as determined
in the specific provision authorizing the claim in &sect;317.371. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5) The label does not represent or purport that the food is for infants and toddlers less than 2 years of age, except
if the claim is specifically provided for in &sect;317.371. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(6) Except where provided for in other regulations in this Part, the meat or meat food product contains 10 percent or
more of the Reference Daily Intake or the Daily Reference Value as defined in &sect;317.309 for vitamin A, vitamin
C, iron, calcium, protein, or fiber per reference amount customarily consumed prior to any nutrient addition, except
the basis for meal-type products as defined in &sect;317.313(l) shall be per labeled serving size prior to any nutrient
addition.

product to supply the substance in the meat or meat food product bearing the health claim. For each such ingredient
listed, the applicant should state how the ingredient complies with the requirements of &sect;317.314(b)(3)(ii),
e.g., that its use is generally recognized as safe (GRAS), listed as a food additive, or authorized by a prior sanction
issued by FSIS, and what the basis is for the GRAS claim, the food additive status, or prior sanctioned status.

B. Summary of scientific data. The summary of scientific data provides the basis upon which authorizing a health claim
can be justified as providing the health benefit. The summary must establish that, based on the totality of publicly
available scientific evidence (including evidence from well-designed studies conducted in a manner which is consistent
with generally recognized scientific procedures and principles), there is significant scientific agreement among
experts qualified by scientific training and experience to evaluate such claims, that the claim is supported by such
evidence.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The summary shall state what public health benefit will derive from use of the claim as proposed. If the claim is intended
for a specific group within the population, the summary shall specifically address nutritional needs of such group
and shall include scientific data showing how the claim is likely to assist in meeting such needs.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The summary shall concentrate on the findings of appropriate review articles, National Institutes of Health consensus
development conferences, and other appropriate resource materials. Issues addressed in the summary shall include
answers to such questions as:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. Is there an optimum level of the particular substance to be consumed beyond which no benefit would be expected?
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. Is there any level at which an adverse effect from the substance or from meat or meat food products containing the
substance occurs for any segment of the population?
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. Are there certain populations that must receive special consideration?
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. What other nutritional or health factors (both positive and negative) are important to consider when consuming
the substance?
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition, the summary of scientific data shall include a detailed analysis of the potential effect of the use of
the proposed claim on food consumption, specifically any change due to significant alterations in eating habits
and corresponding changes in nutrient intake resulting from such changes in food consumption. The latter item shall
specifically address the effect on the intake of nutrients that have beneficial and negative consequences in the
total diet.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If the claim is intended for a significant subpopulation within the general U.S. population, the analysis shall specifically
address the dietary practices of such group, and shall include data sufficient to demonstrate that the dietary analysis
is representative of such group (e.g., adolescents or the elderly).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If appropriate, the labeling application shall explain the prevalence of the disease or health-related condition
in the U.S. population or subpopulation and the relevance of the claim in the context of the total daily diet.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Also, the summary shall demonstrate that the substance that is the subject of the proposed claim conforms to the definition
of the term ``substance'' in &sect;317.314(a)(2).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
C. Analytical data. Analytical data that show the amount of the substance that is present in representative meat and
meat food products that would be candidates to bear the claim should be obtained from representative samples using
methods in accordance with &sect;317.309(h). If no USDA or AOAC methods are available, the applicant shall submit
the assay method used, and data establishing the validity of the method for assaying the substance in the meat or meat
food product. The validation data shall include a statistical analysis of the analytical and product variability.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
D. Model health claim. One or more model health claims that represent label statements that may be used on a label or
in labeling for a meat or meat food product to characterize the relationship between the substance to a disease or health-related
condition that is justified by the summary of scientific data provided in section B of the labeling application. The
model health claim shall include:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. A brief capsulized statement of the relevant conclusions of the summary, and
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. A statement of how this substance helps the consumer to attain a total dietary pattern or goal associated with the
health benefit that is provided.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
E. Supporting Documentation. The labeling application shall include the following attachments:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. Copies of any computer literature searches done by the applicant (e.g., Medline).

Relationship between calcium and osteoporosis. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
An inadequate calcium intake contributes to low peak bone mass and has been identified as one of the many risk factors
in the development of osteoporosis. Peak bone mass is the total quantity of bone present at maturity, and experts believe
that it has the greatest bearing on whether or not a person will be at risk of developing osteoporosis and related bone
fractures later in life. Another factor that influences total bone mass susceptibility to osteoporosis is the rate
of bone loss after skeletal maturity. An adequate intake of calcium is thought to exert a positive effect during adolescence
and early adulthood in optimizing the amount of bone that is laid down. However, the upper limit of peak bone mass is
genetically determined. The mechanism through which an adequate calcium intake and optimal peak bone mass reduce
the risk of osteoporosis is thought to be as follows. All persons lose bone with age. Hence those with higher bone mass
at maturity take longer to reach the critically reduced mass at which bones can fracture easily. The rate of bone loss
after skeletal maturity also influences the amount of bone present at old age and can influence an individual's risk
of developing osteoporosis. Maintenance of an adequate intake of calcium later in life is thought to be important
in reducing the rate of bone loss particularly in the elderly and in women during the first decade following menopause.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Significance of calcium. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Calcium intake is not the only recognized risk factor in the development of osteoporosis, a multifactorial bone disease.
Other factors including a person's sex, race, hormonal status, family history, body stature, level of exercise,
general diet, and specific life style choices such as smoking and excess alcohol consumption affect the risk of osteoporosis.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) Heredity and being female are two key factors identifying those individuals at risk for the development of osteoporosis.
Hereditary risk factors include race: Notably, Caucasians and Asians are characterized by low peak bone mass at maturity.
Caucasian women, particularly those of northern European ancestry, experience the highest incidence of osteoporosis-related
bone fracture. American women of African heritage are characterized by the highest peak bone mass and lowest incidence
osteoporotic fracture, despite the fact that they have low calcium intake. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) Maintenance of an adequate intake of calcium throughout life is particularly important for a subpopulation
of individuals at greatest risk of developing osteoporosis and for whom adequate dietary calcium intake may have
the most important beneficial effects on bone health. This target subpopulation includes adolescent and young adult
Caucasian and Asian American women.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Nature of the claim. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A health claim associating calcium with reduced risk of osteoporosis may be made on the label or labeling of a meat or
meat food product described in paragraph (a)(3)(ii)(B) of this section; 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Provided
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, That: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
1
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
) The claim makes clear that adequate calcium intake throughout life is not the only recognized risk factor in this
multifactorial bone disease by listing specific factors, including a sex, race, and age that place persons at risk
of developing osteoporosis and stating that an adequate level of exercise and a healthful diet are also needed; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
2
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
) The claim does not state or imply that the risk of osteoporosis is equally applicable to the general United States
population. The claim shall identify the populations at particular risk for the development of osteoporosis. These
populations include white (or the term ``Caucasian'') women and Asian women in their bone forming years (approximately
11 to 35 years of age or the phrase ``during teen years or early adult years'' may be used). The claim may also include
menopausal (or the term ``middle-aged'') women, persons with a family history of disease, and elderly (or ``older'')
men and women as being at risk; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
3
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
) The claim states that adequate calcium intake throughout life is linked to reduced risk of osteoporosis through
the mechanism of optimizing peak bone mass during adolescence and early adulthood. The phrase ``build and maintain
good bone health'' may be used to convey the concept of optimizing peak bone mass. When reference is made to persons
with a family history of the disease, menopausal women, and elderly men and women, the claim may also state that adequate
calcium intake is linked to reduced risk of osteoporosis through the mechanism of slowing the rate of the bone loss;

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) Regular exercise and a healthy diet with enough calcium helps teens and young adult white and Asian women maintain

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) [FOR FOODS EXCEPTIONALLY HIGH IN CALCIUM] Regular exercise and a healthy diet with enough calcium helps teens

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Relationship between lipids and cancer. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(i) Cancer is a constellation of more than 100 different diseases, each characterized by the uncontrolled growth
and spread of abnormal cells. Cancer has many causes and stages in its development. Both genetic and environmental
risk factors may affect the risk of cancer. Risk factors include a family history of a specific type of cancer, cigarette
smoking, alcohol consumption, overweight and obesity, ultraviolet or ionizing radiation, exposure to cancer-causing
chemicals, and dietary factors. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) Among dietary factors, the strongest positive association has been found between total fat intake and risk of
some types of cancer. Based on the totality of the publicly available scientific evidence, there is significant scientific
agreement among experts, qualified by training and experience to evaluate such evidence, that diets high in total
fat are associated with an increased cancer risk. Research to date, although not conclusive, demonstrates that the
total amount of fats, rather than any specific type of fat, is positively associated with cancer risk. The mechanism
by which total fat affects cancer has not yet been established. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) A question that has been the subject of considerable research is whether the effect of fat on cancer is site-specific.
Neither human nor animal studies are consistent in the association of fat intake with specific cancer sites. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iv) Another question that has been raised is whether the association of total fat intake to cancer risk is independently
associated with energy intakes, or whether the association of fat with cancer risk is the result of the higher energy
(caloric) intake normally associated with high fat intake. FSIS has concluded that evidence from both animal and
human studies indicates that total fat intake alone, independent of energy intake, is associated with cancer risk.

(2) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Significance of the relationship between fat intake and risk of cancer. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(i) Cancer is ranked as a leading cause of death in the United States. The overall economic costs of cancer, including
direct health care costs and losses due to morbidity and mortality, are very high. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) U.S. diets tend to be high in fat and high in calories. The average U.S. diet is estimated to contain 36 to 37 percent
of calories from total fat. Current dietary guidelines from the Federal Government and nationally recognized health
professional organizations recommend that dietary fat intake be reduced to a level of 30 percent or less of energy
(calories) from total fat. In order to reduce intake of total fat, individuals should choose diets which are high in
vegetables, fruits, and grain products (particularly whole grain products), choose lean cuts of meats, fish, and
poultry, substitute low-fat dairy products for higher fat products, and use fats and oils sparingly.

Sodium and high blood pressure
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
_(1) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Relationship between sodium and hypertension (high blood pressure).
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (i) Hypertension, or high blood pressure, generally means a systolic blood pressure of greater than 140 millimeters
of mercury (mm Hg) or a diastolic blood pressure of greater than 90 mm Hg. Normotension, or normal blood pressure, is
a systolic blood pressure below 140 mm Hg and diastolic blood pressure below 90 mm Hg. Sodium is specified here as the
chemical entity or electrolyte ``sodium'' and is distinguished from sodium chloride, or salt, which is 39 percent
sodium by weight. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) The scientific evidence establishes that diets high in sodium are associated with a high prevalence of hypertension
or high blood pressure and with increases in blood pressure with age, and that diets low in sodium are associated with
a low prevalence of hypertension or high blood pressure and with a low or no increase of blood pressure with age. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Significance of sodium in relation to high blood pressure.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (i) High blood pressure is a public health concern primarily because it is a major risk factor for mortality from coronary
heart disease and stroke. Early management of high blood pressure is a major public health goal that can assist in reducing
mortality associated with coronary heart disease and stroke. There is a continuum of mortality risk that increases
as blood pressures rise. Individuals with high blood pressure are at greatest risk, and individuals with moderately
high, high normal, and normal blood pressure are at steadily decreasing risk. The scientific evidence indicates
that reducing sodium intake lowers blood pressure and associated risks in many but not all hypertensive individuals.
There is also evidence that reducing sodium intake lowers blood pressure and associated risks in many but not all normotensive
individuals as well. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) The populations at greatest risk for high blood pressure, and those most likely to benefit from sodium reduction,
include those with family histories of high blood pressure, the elderly, males because they develop hypertension
earlier in life than females, and black males and females. Although some population groups are at greater risk than
others, high blood pressure is a disease of public health concern for all population groups. Sodium intake, alcohol
consumption, and obesity are identified risk factors for high blood pressure. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) Sodium intakes exceed recommended levels in almost every group in the United States. One of the major public
health recommendations relative to high blood pressure is to decrease consumption of salt. On a population-wide
basis, reducing the average sodium intake would have a small but significant effect on reducing the average blood
pressure, and, consequently, reducing mortality from coronary heart disease and stroke. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iv) Sodium is an essential nutrient, and experts have recommended a safe minimum level of 500 mg sodium per day and
an upper level of 2,400 mg sodium per day, which is the Daily Reference Value for sodium.

Dietary saturated fat and cholesterol and risk of coronary heart disease
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
_(1) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Relationship between dietary saturated fat and cholesterol and risk of coronary heart disease.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (i) Cardiovascular disease means diseases of the heart and circulatory system. Coronary heart disease is the most
common and serious form of cardiovascular disease and refers to diseases of the heart muscle and supporting blood
vessels. High blood total- and low density lipoprotein (LDL)-cholesterol levels are major modifiable risk factors
in the development of coronary heart disease. High coronary heart disease rates occur among people with high blood
cholesterol levels of 240 mg per decaliter (mg/dL) (6.21 millimoles per liter (mmol/L) or above and LDL-cholesterol
levels of 160 mg/dL (4.13 mmol/L) or above. Borderline high risk blood cholesterol levels range from 200 to 239 mg/dL
(5.17 to 6.18 mmol/L) and 130 to 159 mg/dL (3.36 to 4.11 mmol/L) of LDL-cholesterol. Dietary lipids (fats) include
fatty acids and cholesterol. Total fat, commonly referred to as fat, is composed of saturated fat (fatty acids containing
no double bonds), and monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fat (fatty acids containing one or more double bonds).

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) The scientific evidence establishes that diets high in saturated fat and cholesterol are associated with increased
levels of blood total- and LDL-cholesterol and, thus, with increased risk of coronary heart disease. Diets low in
saturated fat and cholesterol are associated with decreased levels of blood total- and LDL-cholesterol and, thus,
with decreased risk of developing coronary heart disease. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Significance of the relationship between dietary saturated fat and cholesterol and risk of coronary heart disease.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (i) Coronary heart disease is a major public health concern in the United States, primarily because it accounts for
more deaths than any other disease or group of diseases. Early management of risk factors for coronary heart disease
is a major public health goal that can assist in reducing risk of coronary heart disease. There is a continuum of mortality
risk from coronary heart disease that increases with increasing levels of blood LDL-cholesterol. Individuals with
high blood LDL-cholesterol are at greatest risk. A larger number of individuals with more moderately elevated cholesterol
also have increased risk of coronary events; such individuals comprise a substantial proportion of the adult U.S.
population. The scientific evidence indicates that reducing saturated fat and cholesterol intakes lowers blood
LDL-cholesterol and risk of heart disease in most individuals. There is also evidence that reducing saturated fat
and cholesterol intakes in persons with blood cholesterol levels in the normal range also reduces risk of heart disease.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) Other risk factors for coronary heart disease include a family history of heart disease, high blood pressure,
diabetes, cigarette smoking, obesity, and lack of regular physical exercise. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) Intakes of saturated fat exceed recommended levels in many people in the United States. Intakes of cholesterol
are, on average, at or above recommended levels. One of the major public health recommendations relative to coronary
heart disease risk is to consume less than 10 percent of calories from saturated fat, and an average of 30 percent or
less of total calories from all fat. Recommended daily cholesterol intakes are 300 mg or less.

fat and cholesterol and risk of heart disease: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) While many factors affect heart disease, diets low in saturated fat and cholesterol may reduce the risk of this
disease. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) Development of heart disease depends upon many factors, but its risk may be reduced by diets low in saturated fat
and cholesterol and healthy lifestyles. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) Development of heart disease depends on many factors, including a family history of the disease, high blood
LDL-cholesterol, diabetes, high blood pressure, being overweight, cigarette smoking, lack of exercise, and the
type of dietary pattern. A healthful diet low in saturated fat, total fat, and cholesterol, as part of a healthy lifestyle,
may lower blood cholesterol levels and may reduce the risk of heart disease. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iv) Many factors, such as family history of the disease, increased blood total- and LDL-cholesterol levels, high
blood pressure, cigarette smoking, diabetes, and being overweight, contribute to developing heart disease. Eating
a diet low in saturated fat, cholesterol, and total fat may help reduce the risk of heart disease.

Relationship between diets low in fat and high in fiber-containing grain products, fruits, and vegetables and cancer
risk.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (i) Cancer is a constellation of more than 100 different diseases, each characterized by the uncontrolled growth
and spread of abnormal cells. Cancer has many causes and stages in its development. Both genetic and environmental
risk factors may affect the risk of cancer. Risk factors include a family history of a specific type of cancer, cigarette
smoking, alcohol consumption, overweight and obesity, ultraviolet or ionizing radiation, exposure to cancer-causing
chemicals, and dietary factors. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) The scientific evidence establishes that diets low in fat and high in fiber-containing grain products, fruits,
and vegetables are associated with a reduced risk of some types of cancer. Although the specific role of total dietary
fiber, fiber components, and the multiple nutrients and other substances contained in these foods are not fully understood,
many studies have shown that diets low in fat and high in fiber-containing foods are associated with reduced risk of
some types of cancer.

 Significance of the relationship between consumption of diets low in fat and high in fiber-containing grain products,
fruits, and vegetables and risk of cancer.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (i) Cancer is ranked as a leading cause of death in the United States. The overall economic costs of cancer, including
direct health care costs and losses due to morbidity and mortality, are very high. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) U.S. diets tend to be high in fat and low in grain products, fruits, and vegetables. Studies in various parts of
the world indicate that populations who habitually consume a diet high in plant foods have lower risks of some cancers.
These diets are generally low in fat and rich in many nutrients, including, but not limited to, dietary fiber. Current
dietary guidelines from the Federal Government and nationally recognized health professional organizations recommend
decreased consumption of fats (less than 30 percent of calories), maintenance of desirable body weight, and increased
consumption of fruits and vegetables (five or more servings daily), and grain products (six or more servings daily).

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Relationship between diets low in saturated fat and cholesterol and high in fruits, vegetables, and grain products
that contain fiber, particularly soluble fiber, and risk of coronary heart disease.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (i) Cardiovascular disease means diseases of the heart and circulatory system. Coronary heart disease is the most
common and serious form of cardiovascular disease and refers to diseases of the heart muscle and supporting blood
vessels. High blood total- and low density lipoprotein (LDL)-cholesterol levels are major modifiable risk factors
in the development of coronary heart disease. High coronary heart disease rates occur among people with high blood
cholesterol levels of 240 mg per decaliter (mg/dL) (6.21 millimoles per liter (mmol/L) or above and LDL-cholesterol
levels of 160 mg/dL (4.13 mmol/L) or above. Borderline high risk blood cholesterol levels range from 200 to 239 mg/dL
(5.17 to 6.18 mmol/L) and 130 to 159 mg/dL (3.36 to 4.11 mmol/L) of LDL-cholesterol. Dietary lipids (fats) include
fatty acids and cholesterol. Total fat, commonly referred to as fat, is composed of saturated fat (fatty acids containing
no double bonds), and monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fat (fatty acids containing one or more double bonds).

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) The scientific evidence establishes that diets high in saturated fat and cholesterol are associated with increased
levels of blood total- and LDL-cholesterol and, thus, with increased risk of coronary heart disease. Diets low in
saturated fat and cholesterol are associated with decreased levels of blood total- and LDL-cholesterol and, thus,
with decreased risk of developing coronary heart disease.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(iii) Populations with relatively low blood cholesterol levels tend to have dietary patterns that are not only low
in total fat, especially saturated fat and cholesterol, but are also relatively high in fruits, vegetables, and grain
products. Although the specific roles of these plant foods are not yet fully understood, many studies have shown that
diets high in plant foods are associated with reduced risk of coronary heart disease. These studies correlate diets
rich in fruits, vegetables, and grain products and nutrients from these diets, such as some types of fiber, with reduced
coronary heart disease risk. Persons consuming these diets frequently have high intakes of dietary fiber, particularly
soluble fiber. Currently, there is not scientific agreement as to whether a particular type of soluble fiber is beneficial,
or whether the observed protective effects of fruits, vegetables, and grain products against heart disease are due
to other components, or a combination of components, in these diets, including, but not necessarily limited to, some
types of soluble fiber, other fiber components, other characteristics of the complex carbohydrate content of these
foods, other nutrients in these foods, or displacement of saturated fat and cholesterol from the diet.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Significance of the relationship between diets low in saturated fat and cholesterol and high in fruits, vegetables,
and grain products that contain fiber, particularly soluble fiber, and risk of coronary heart disease. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(i) Coronary heart disease is a major public health concern in the United States, primarily because it accounts for
more deaths than any other disease or group of diseases. Early management of risk factors for coronary heart disease
is a major public health goal that can assist in reducing risk of coronary heart disease. There is a continuum of mortality
risk from coronary heart disease that increases with increasing levels of blood LDL-cholesterol. Individuals with
high blood LDL-cholesterol are at greatest risk. A larger number of individuals with more moderately elevated cholesterol
also have increased risk of coronary events; such individuals comprise a substantial proportion of the adult U.S.
population. The scientific evidence indicates that reducing saturated fat and cholesterol intakes lowers blood
LDL-cholesterol and risk of heart disease in most individuals, including persons with blood cholesterol levels
in the normal range. Additionally, consuming diets high in fruits, vegetables, and grain products, foods that contain
soluble fiber, may be a useful adjunct to a low saturated fat and low cholesterol diet. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) Other risk factors for coronary heart disease include a family history of heart disease, high blood pressure,
diabetes, cigarette smoking, obesity, and lack of regular physical exercise. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) Intakes of saturated fat exceed recommended levels in many people in the United States. Intakes of cholesterol
are, on average, at or above recommended levels. Intakes of fiber-containing fruits, vegetables, and grain products
are about half of recommended intake levels. One of the major public health recommendations relative to coronary
heart disease risk is to consume less than 10 percent of calories from saturated fat, and an average of 30 percent or
less of total calories from all fat. Recommended daily cholesterol intakes are 300 mg or less. Recommended total dietary
fiber intakes are about 25 g daily, of which about 25 percent (about 6 g) should be soluble fiber. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iv) Current dietary guidance recommendations encourage decreased consumption of dietary fat, especially saturated
fat and cholesterol, and increased consumption of fiber-rich foods to help lower blood LDL-cholesterol levels.
Results of numerous studies have shown that fiber-containing fruits, vegetables, and grain products can help lower
blood LDL-cholesterol.

Relationship between substances in diets low in fat and high in fruits and vegetables and cancer risk.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(i) Cancer is a constellation of more than 100 different diseases, each characterized by the uncontrolled growth
and spread of abnormal cells. Cancer has many causes and stages in its development. Both genetic and environmental
risk factors may affect the risk of cancer. Risk factors include a family history of a specific type of cancer, cigarette
smoking, alcohol consumption, overweight and obesity, ultraviolet or ionizing radiation, exposure to cancer-causing
chemicals, and dietary factors. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) Although the specific roles of the numerous potentially protective substances in plant foods are not yet understood,
many studies have shown that diets high in plant foods are associated with reduced risk of some types of cancers. These
studies correlate diets rich in fruits and vegetables and nutrients from these diets, such as vitamin C, vitamin A,
and dietary fiber, with reduced cancer risk. Persons consuming these diets frequently have high intakes of these
nutrients. Currently there is not scientific agreement as to whether the observed protective effects of fruits and
vegetables against cancer are due to a combination of the nutrient components of diets rich in fruits and vegetables,
including but not necessarily limited to dietary fiber, vitamin A as

Folate and neural tube defects
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
_(1) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Relationship between folate and neural tube defects
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. (i) Neural tube defects are serious birth defects of the brain or spinal cord that can result in infant mortality or
serious disability. The birth defects anencephaly and spina bifida are the most common forms of neural tube defects
and account for about 90 percent of these defects. These defects result from failure of closure of the covering of the
brain or spinal cord during early embryonic development. Because the neural tube forms and closes during early pregnancy,
the defect may occur before a woman realizes that she is pregnant. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) The available data show that diets adequate in folate may reduce the risk of neural tube defects. The strongest
evidence for this relationship comes from an intervention study by the Medical Research Council of the United Kingdom
that showed that women at risk of recurrence of a neural tube defect pregnancy who consumed a supplement containing
4 mg (4,000 micrograms (mcg)) folic acid daily had a reduced risk of having a child with a neural tube defect. (Products
that contain this level of folic acid are drugs.) In addition, based on its review of a Hungarian intervention trial
that used a multivitamin and multimineral preparation containing 800 mcg (0.8 mg) of folic acid, and its review of
the observational studies that reported use of multivitamins containing 0 to 1,000 mcg of folic acid, FDA concluded
that most of these studies had results consistent with the conclusion that folate, at levels attainable in usual diets,
may reduce the risk of neural tube defects. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Significance of folate. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(i) Neural tube defects occur in approximately 0.6 of 1,000 live births in the United States (i.e., about 2,500 cases
among 4 million live births annually). Neural tube defects are believed to be caused by many factors. The single greatest
risk factor for a neural tube defect-affected pregnancy is a personal or family history of a pregnancy affected with
a such a defect. However, about 90 percent of infants with a neural tube defect are born to women who do not have a family
history of these defects. The available evidence shows that diets adequate in folate may reduce the risk of neural
tube defects but not of other birth defects. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) Prevalence rates for neural tube defects have been reported to vary with a wide range of factors, including genetics,
geography, socioeconomic status, maternal birth cohort, month of conception, race, nutrition, and maternal age
and reproductive history. Women with a close relative (i.e., sibling, niece, nephew) with a neural tube defect, those
with insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus, and women with seizure disorders who are being treated with valproic
acid or carbamazepine are at significantly increased risk compared with women without these characteristics. Rates
for neural tube defects vary within the United States, with lower rates observed on the west coast than on the east coast.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) Based on a synthesis of the results of several observational studies, the Public Health Service has estimated
that about 50 percent of neural tube defect-affected pregnancies in the United States (e.g., about 1,250) may be averted
annually if all women consume adequate amounts of folate daily (i.e., 0.4 mg) throughout their childbearing years.

folate and neural tube defects:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) Women who consume adequate amounts of folate, a B vitamin, daily throughout their childbearing years may reduce
their risk of having a child with a neural tube birth defect. Such birth defects, while not widespread, are very serious.
They can have many causes. Adequate amounts of folate can be obtained from diets rich in fruits, dark green leafy vegetables
and legumes, enriched grain products, fortified cereals, or a supplement. Folate consumption should be limited
to 1,000 mcg per day from all sources.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) Women who consume adequate amounts of folate daily throughout their childbearing years may reduce their risk
of having a child with a birth defect of the brain and spinal cord. Such birth defects, while not widespread, are very
serious. They can have many causes. Adequate amounts of folate, a B vitamin, can be obtained from diets rich in fruits,
dark green leafy vegetables and legumes, enriched grain products, fortified cereals, or a supplement. Women who
have had a child with a spinal cord birth defect should consult a physician before becoming pregnant. Folate consumption
should be limited to 1,000 mcg per day from all sources.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) Women who take steps to ensure that their folate intake is adequate throughout their childbearing years may
reduce their risk of having a child with a neural tube defect. Such birth defects, while not widespread, are very serious.
They can have many causes. Adequate amounts of folate, a B vitamin, can be obtained from diets rich in citrus fruits
and juices, dark green leafy vegetables and legumes, enriched grain products such as breads, rice, and pasta, fortified
cereals, or a supplement. Folate consumption should be limited to 1,000 mcg per day from all sources.

(v) Some women who consume the Daily Value of folate (400 mcg) throughout their childbearing years may reduce their
risk of having a child affected with spina bifida or anencephaly, birth defects of the brain or spinal cord that, while
not widespread, are very serious. These birth defects can have many causes. Women of childbearing age should choose
well-balanced diets that include 2 to 4 servings per day of fruits (including citrus fruits and juices), 3 to 5 servings
of vegetables (including dark green leafy vegetables and legumes), 6 to 11 servings of enriched grain products (such

symbol), or vignettes, characterizes the relationship of any substance to a disease or health-related condition.
Implied health claims include those statements, symbols, vignettes, or other forms of communication that suggest,
within the context in which they are presented, that a relationship exists between the presence or level of a substance
in the poultry product and a disease or health-related condition.

Disqualifying nutrient levels
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 mean the levels of total fat, saturated fat, cholesterol, or sodium in a poultry product above which the product will
be disqualified from making a health claim. These levels are 13 grams (g) of fat, 4 g of saturated fat, 60 milligrams
(mg) of cholesterol, or 480 mg of sodium per reference amount customarily consumed, per labeled serving size, and,
only for foods with reference amounts customarily consumed of 30 g or less or 2 tablespoons or less, per 50 g. For dehydrated
products that must be reconstituted before typical consumption with water or a diluent containing an insignificant
amount, as defined in &sect;381.409(g)(1), of all nutrients, the per 50-g criterion refers to the prepared form.
Any one of the levels, on a per reference amount customarily consumed, a per labeled serving size or, when applicable,
a 50-g basis, will disqualify a poultry product from making a health claim unless an exception is provided for in &sect;381.471,
except that:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) The levels for a meal product as defined in &sect;381.413(l) and that weighs at least 6 ounces (oz), but less than
10 oz, per serving (container) are 20 g of fat, 6 g of saturated fat, 95 mg of cholesterol, or 720 mg of sodium per labeled
serving size.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 For a substance to be eligible for a health claim:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) The substance must be associated with a disease or health-related condition for which the general U.S. population,
or an identified U.S. population subgroup (e.g., the elderly) is at risk, or, alternatively, the labeling application
submitted by the proponent of the claim otherwise explains the prevalence of the disease or health-related condition
in the U.S. population and the relevance of the claim in context of the total daily diet and satisfies the other requirements
of this section.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) If the substance is to be consumed as a component of a poultry product at decreased dietary levels, the substance

(c) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Validity requirement. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Administrator will approve the use of a health claim only when he or she determines that the claim is not false or
misleading, because it is supported by: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) The totality of publicly available scientific evidence (including evidence from well-designed studies conducted
in a manner which is consistent with generally recognized scientific procedures and principles); and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Significant scientific agreement among experts qualified by scientific training and experience to evaluate
such claims. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(d) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
General health claim labeling requirements. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(1) When the Administrator determines that a health claim meets the requirements of paragraph (c) of this section,
the Agency will notify the applicant, in writing, and will institute rulemaking to amend the regulations to authorize
the use of that claim. If the claim pertains to a substance not provided for in Part 381 of the regulations, the Administrator
will institute rulemaking to amend the regulations to include declaration of the substance. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) When a regulation has been established in this Part providing for a health claim, firms may make claims based on
the regulation in this Part; 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Provided, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
That: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) All label or labeling statements about the substance-disease relationship that is the subject of the claim are
based on, and consistent with, the conclusions set forth in &sect;381.471; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) The claim is limited to describing the value that ingestion (or reduced ingestion) of the substance, as part of
a total dietary pattern, may have on a particular disease or health-related condition; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) The claim is otherwise complete, truthful, and not misleading. Where factors other than dietary intake of the
substance affect the relationship between the substance and the disease or health-related condition, such factors
may be required to be addressed in the claim by a specific provision in &sect;381.471; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iv) All information required to be included in the claim appears in one place without other intervening material,
except that the principal display panel of the label or labeling may bear the reference statement, ``See 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=7 f=2 -->
XXXX
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
,'' with the blanks filled in with the location of the labeling containing the health claim, the name of the substance,
and the disease or health-related condition (e.g., ``See attached pamphlet for information about calcium and osteoporosis''),
with the entire claim appearing elsewhere on the other labeling; 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Provided,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 That, where any graphic material (e.g., a heart symbol) constituting an explicit or implied health claim appears
on the label or labeling, the reference statement or the complete claim shall appear in immediate proximity to such
graphic material; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(v) The claim enables the public to comprehend the information provided and to understand the relative significance
of such information in the context of the total daily diet; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(vi) If the claim is about the effects of consuming the substance at decreased dietary levels, the level of the substance
in the poultry product is sufficiently low to justify the claim. To meet this requirement, if a definition for use of
the term ``low'' has been established for that substance under this Part, the substance must be present at a level that
meets the requirements for use of that term, unless a specific alternative level has been established for the substance
in &sect;381.471. If no definition for ``low'' has been established, the level of the substance must meet the level
established in the regulation authorizing the claim; or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(vii) If the claim is about the effects of consuming the substance at other than decreased dietary levels, the level
of the substance is sufficiently high to justify the claim. To meet this requirement, if a definition for use of the
term ``high'' for that substance has been established under this Part, the substance must be present at a level that
meets the requirements for use of that term, unless a specific alternative level has been established for the substance
in &sect;381.471. If no definition for ``high'' has been established (e.g., where the claim pertains to a food either
as a whole food or as an ingredient in another food), the claim must specify the daily dietary intake necessary to achieve
the claimed effect, as established in the regulation authorizing the claim; 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Provided,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 That, where the poultry product that bears the claim meets the requirements of paragraphs (d)(2)(vi) or (d)(2)(vii)
of this section based on its reference amount customarily consumed, and the labeled serving size differs from that
amount, the claim shall be followed by a statement explaining that the claim is based on the reference amount rather
than the labeled serving size (e.g., ``Diets low in sodium may reduce the risk of high blood pressure, a disease associated
with many factors. A serving of 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=7 f=2 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 ounces of this product conforms to such a diet.'') 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Nutrition labeling shall be provided in the label or labeling of any poultry product for which a health claim is
made in accordance with &sect;381.409.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(3) None of the disqualifying levels identified in paragraph (a)(4) of this section is exceeded in the poultry product,
unless specific alternative levels have been established for the substance in &sect;381.471; or, unless the Administrator
has permitted a claim despite the fact that a disqualifying level of a nutrient is present in the product based on a finding
that such a claim will assist consumers in maintaining healthy dietary practices, and, in accordance with the regulation
in this Part that makes such a finding, the labeling bears a referral statement disclosing the nutrient(s) that exceeds
the disqualifying level as follows: ``See [appropriate panel or Nutrition Facts] for information about [nutrient
requiring disclosure] and other nutrients.'' The statement shall be in easily legible boldface print or type, in
distinct contrast to other printed or graphic matter, that is no less than that required for net quantity of contents,
except where the size of the claim is less than two times the required size of the net quantity of contents statement,
in which case the referral statement shall be no less than one-half the size of the claim but no smaller than one-sixteenth
of an inch. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) Except as provided in paragraph (e)(3) of this section, no substance is present at an inappropriate level as determined
in the specific provision authorizing the claim in &sect;381.471. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5) The label does not represent or purport that the food is for infants and toddlers less than 2 years of age, except
if the claim is specifically provided for in &sect;381.471. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(6) Except where provided for in other regulations in this Part, the poultry product contains 10 percent or more of
the Reference Daily Intake or the Daily Reference Value as defined in &sect;381.409 for vitamin A, vitamin C, iron,
calcium, protein, or fiber per reference amount customarily consumed prior to any nutrient addition, except the
basis for meal-type products as defined in &sect;381.413(l) shall be per labeled serving size prior to any nutrient
addition.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
Attached hereto, and constituting a part of this labeling application, are the following: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A. Preliminary requirements. A complete explanation of how the substance conforms to the requirements of &sect;381.414(b).
For labeling applications where the subject substance is a food ingredient or a component of a food ingredient, the
applicant should compile a comprehensive list of the specific ingredients that will be added to the poultry product
to supply the substance in the poultry product bearing the health claim. For each such ingredient listed, the applicant
should state how the ingredient complies with the requirements of &sect;381.414(b)(3)(ii), e.g., that its use is
generally recognized as safe (GRAS), listed as a food additive, or authorized by a prior sanction issued by FSIS, and
what the basis is for the GRAS claim, the food additive status, or prior sanctioned status. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
B. Summary of scientific data. The summary of scientific data provides the basis upon which authorizing a health claim
can be justified as providing the health benefit. The summary must establish that, based on the totality of publicly
available scientific evidence (including evidence from well-designed studies conducted in a manner which is consistent
with generally recognized scientific procedures and principles), there is significant scientific agreement among
experts qualified by scientific training and experience to evaluate such claims, that the claim is supported by such
evidence. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The summary shall state what public health benefit will derive from use of the claim as proposed. If the claim is intended
for a specific group within the population, the summary shall specifically address nutritional needs of such group
and shall include scientific data showing how the claim is likely to assist in meeting such needs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The summary shall concentrate on the findings of appropriate review articles, National Institutes of Health consensus
development conferences, and other appropriate resource materials. Issues addressed in the summary shall include
answers to such questions as: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. Is there an optimum level of the particular substance 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to be consumed beyond which no benefit would be expected? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. Is there any level at which an adverse effect from the substance or from poultry products containing the substance
occurs for any segment of the population? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. Are there certain populations that must receive special consideration? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. What other nutritional or health factors (both positive and negative) are important to consider when consuming
the substance? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition, the summary of scientific data shall include a detailed analysis of the potential effect of the use of
the proposed claim on food consumption, specifically any change due to significant alterations in eating habits
and corresponding changes in nutrient intake resulting from such changes in food consumption. The latter item shall
specifically address the effect on the intake of nutrients that have beneficial and negative consequences in the
total diet. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If the claim is intended for a significant subpopulation within the general U.S. population, the analysis shall specifically
address the dietary practices of such group, and shall include data sufficient to demonstrate that the dietary analysis
is representative of such group (e.g., adolescents or the elderly). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If appropriate, the labeling application shall explain the prevalence of the disease or health-related condition
in the U.S. population or subpopulation and the relevance of the claim in the context of the total daily diet. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Also, the summary shall demonstrate that the substance that is the subject of the proposed claim conforms to the definition
of the term ``substance'' in &sect;381.414(a)(2). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
C. Analytical data. Analytical data that show the amount of the substance that is present in representative poultry
products that would be candidates to bear the claim should be obtained from representative samples using methods
in accordance with &sect;381.409(h). If no USDA or AOAC methods are available, the applicant shall submit the assay
method used, and data establishing the validity of the method for assaying the substance in the poultry product. The
validation data shall include a statistical analysis of the analytical and product variability.

D. Model health claim. One or more model health claims that represent label statements that may be used on a label or
in labeling for a poultry product to characterize the relationship between the substance to a disease or health-related
condition that is justified by the summary of scientific data provided in section B of the labeling application. The
model health claim shall include: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. A brief capsulized statement of the relevant conclusions of the summary, and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. A statement of how this substance helps the consumer to attain a total dietary pattern or goal associated with the
health benefit that is provided. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
E. Supporting Documentation. The labeling application shall include the following attachments: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. Copies of any computer literature searches done by the applicant (e.g., Medline). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. Copies of articles cited in the literature searches and other information as follows: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a. All information relied upon for the support of the health claim, including copies of publications or other information
cited in review articles and used to perform meta-analyses. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
b. All information concerning adverse consequences to any segment of the population (e.g., sensitivity to the substance).

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
c. All information pertaining to the U.S. population. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
F. The applicant is required to submit either a claim for categorical exclusion under 21 CFR 25.24 or an environmental
assessment under 21 CFR 25.31.

Relationship between calcium and osteoporosis
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 An inadequate calcium intake contributes to low peak bone mass and has been identified as one of the many risk factors
in the development of osteoporosis. Peak bone mass is the total quantity of bone present at maturity, and experts believe
that it has the greatest bearing on whether or not a person will be at risk of developing osteoporosis and related bone
fractures later in life. Another factor that influences total bone mass susceptibility to osteoporosis is the rate
of bone loss after skeletal maturity. An adequate intake of calcium is thought to exert a positive effect during adolescence
and early adulthood in optimizing the amount of bone that is laid down. However, the upper limit of peak bone mass is
genetically determined. The mechanism through which an adequate calcium intake and optimal peak bone mass reduce
the risk of osteoporosis is thought to be as follows. All persons lose bone with age. Hence those with higher bone mass
at maturity take longer to reach the critically reduced mass at which bones can fracture easily. The rate of bone loss
after skeletal maturity also influences the amount of bone present at old age and can influence an individual's risk
of developing osteoporosis. Maintenance of an adequate intake of calcium later in life is thought to be important
in reducing the rate of bone loss particularly in the elderly and in women during the first decade following menopause.

Significance of calcium. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Calcium intake is not the only recognized risk factor in the development of osteoporosis, a multifactorial bone disease.
Other factors including a person's sex, race, hormonal status, family history, body stature, level of exercise,
general diet, and specific life style choices such as smoking and excess alcohol consumption affect the risk of osteoporosis.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) Heredity and being female are two key factors identifying those individuals at risk for the development of osteoporosis.
Hereditary risk factors include race: Notably, Caucasians and Asians are characterized by low peak bone mass at maturity.
Caucasian women, particularly those of northern European ancestry, experience the highest incidence of osteoporosis-related
bone fracture. American women of African heritage are characterized by the highest peak bone mass and lowest incidence
osteoporotic fracture, despite the fact that they have low calcium intake. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) Maintenance of an adequate intake of calcium throughout life is particularly important for a subpopulation
of individuals at greatest risk of developing osteoporosis and for whom adequate dietary calcium intake may have
the most important beneficial effects on bone health. This target subpopulation includes adolescent and young adult
Caucasian and Asian American women.

Nature of the claim.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 A health claim associating calcium with reduced risk of osteoporosis may be made on the label or labeling of a poultry
product described in paragraph (a)(3)(ii) (B) of this section; 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Provided,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

(
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
1
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
) The claim makes clear that adequate calcium intake throughout life is not the only recognized risk factor in this
multifactorial bone disease by listing specific factors, including a sex, race, and age that place persons at risk
of developing osteoporosis and stating that an adequate level of exercise and a healthful diet are also needed; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

(
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
2
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
) The claim does not state or imply that the risk of osteoporosis is equally applicable to the general United States
population. The claim shall identify the populations at particular risk for the development of osteoporosis. These
populations include white (or the term ``Caucasian'') women and Asian women in their bone forming years (approximately
11 to 35 years of age or the phrase ``during teen years or early adult years'' may be used). The claim may also include
menopausal (or the term ``middle-aged'') women, persons with a family history of disease, and elderly (or ``older'')
men and women as being at risk;

) The claim states that adequate calcium intake throughout life is linked to reduced risk of osteoporosis through
the mechanism of optimizing peak bone mass during adolescence and early adulthood. The phrase ``build and maintain
good bone health'' may be used to convey the concept of optimizing peak bone mass. When reference is made to persons
with a family history of the disease, menopausal women, and elderly men and women, the claim may also state that adequate
calcium intake is linked to reduced risk of osteoporosis through the mechanism of slowing the rate of the bone loss;

 The following model health claims may be used in food labeling to describe the relationship between calcium and osteoporosis:

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) Regular exercise and a healthy diet with enough calcium helps teens and young adult white and Asian women maintain
good bone health and may reduce their high risk of osteoporosis later in life. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) [FOR FOODS EXCEPTIONALLY HIGH IN CALCIUM] Regular exercise and a healthy diet with enough calcium helps teens
and young adult white and Asian women maintain good bone health and may reduce their high risk of osteoporosis later
in life. Adequate calcium intake is important, but daily intakes above about 2,000 mg are not likely to provide any
additional benefit.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Relationship between lipids and cancer.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (i) Cancer is a constellation of more than 100 different diseases, each characterized by the uncontrolled growth
and spread of abnormal cells. Cancer has many causes and stages in its development. Both genetic and environmental
risk factors may affect the risk of cancer. Risk factors include a family history of a specific type of cancer, cigarette
smoking, alcohol consumption, overweight and obesity, ultraviolet or ionizing radiation, exposure to cancer-causing
chemicals, and dietary factors. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) Among dietary factors, the strongest positive association has been found between total fat intake and risk of
some types of cancer. Based on the totality of the publicly available scientific evidence, there is significant scientific
agreement among experts, qualified by training and experience to evaluate such evidence, that diets high in total
fat are associated with an increased cancer risk. Research to date, although not conclusive, demonstrates that the
total amount of fats, rather than any specific type of fat, is positively associated with cancer risk. The mechanism
by which total fat affects cancer has not yet been established. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) A question that has been the subject of considerable research is whether the effect of fat on cancer is site-specific.
Neither human nor animal studies are consistent in the association of fat intake with specific cancer sites. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iv) Another question that has been raised is whether the association of total fat intake to cancer risk is independently
associated with energy intakes, or whether the association of fat with cancer risk is the result of the higher energy
(caloric) intake normally associated with high fat intake. FSIS has concluded that evidence from both animal and
human studies indicates that total fat intake alone, independent of energy intake, is associated with cancer risk.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Significance of the relationship between fat intake and risk of cancer.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (i) Cancer is ranked as a leading cause of death in the United States. The overall economic costs of cancer, including
direct health care costs and losses due to morbidity and mortality, are very high. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) U.S. diets tend to be high in fat and high in calories. The average U.S. diet is estimated to contain 36 to 37 percent
of calories from total fat. Current dietary guidelines from the Federal Government and nationally recognized health
professional organizations recommend that dietary fat intake be reduced to a level of 30 percent or less of energy
(calories) from total fat. In order to reduce intake of total fat, individuals should choose diets which are high in
vegetables, fruits, and grain products (particularly whole grain products), choose lean cuts of meats, fish, and
poultry, substitute low-fat dairy products for higher fat products, and use fats and oils sparingly.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(i) Hypertension, or high blood pressure, generally means a systolic blood pressure of greater than 140 millimeters
of mercury (mm Hg) or a diastolic blood pressure of greater than 90 mm Hg. Normotension, or normal blood pressure, is
a systolic blood pressure below 140 mm Hg and diastolic blood pressure below 90 mm Hg. Sodium is specified here as the
chemical entity or electrolyte ``sodium'' and is distinguished from sodium chloride, or salt, which is 39 percent
sodium by weight.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) The scientific evidence establishes that diets high in sodium are associated with a high prevalence of hypertension
or high blood pressure and with increases in blood pressure with age, and that diets low in sodium are associated with
a low prevalence of hypertension or high blood pressure and with a low or no increase of blood pressure with age.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(i) High blood pressure is a public health concern primarily because it is a major risk factor for mortality from coronary
heart disease and stroke. Early management of high blood pressure is a major public health goal that can assist in reducing
mortality associated with coronary heart disease and stroke. There is a continuum of mortality risk that increases
as blood pressures rise. Individuals with high blood pressure are at greatest risk, and individuals with moderately
high, high normal, and normal blood pressure are at steadily decreasing risk. The scientific evidence indicates
that reducing sodium intake lowers blood pressure and associated risks in many but not all hypertensive individuals.
There is also evidence that reducing sodium intake lowers blood pressure and associated risks in many but not all normotensive
individuals as well.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) The populations at greatest risk for high blood pressure, and those most likely to benefit from sodium reduction,
include those with family histories of high blood pressure, the elderly, males because they develop hypertension
earlier in life than females, and black males and females. Although some population groups are at greater risk than
others, high blood pressure is a disease of public health concern for all population groups. Sodium intake, alcohol
consumption, and obesity are identified risk factors for high blood pressure.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) Sodium intakes exceed recommended levels in almost every group in the United States. One of the major public
health recommendations relative to high blood pressure is to decrease consumption of salt. On a population-wide
basis, reducing the average sodium intake would have a small but significant effect on reducing the average blood
pressure, and, consequently, reducing mortality from coronary heart disease and stroke.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iv) Sodium is an essential nutrient, and experts have recommended a safe minimum level of 500 mg sodium per day and
an upper level of 2,400 mg sodium per day, which is the Daily Reference Value for sodium.

Dietary saturated fat and cholesterol and risk of coronary heart disease_

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Relationship between dietary saturated fat and cholesterol and risk of coronary heart disease. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(i) Cardiovascular disease means diseases of the heart and circulatory system. Coronary heart disease is the most
common and serious form of cardiovascular disease and refers to diseases of the heart muscle and supporting blood
vessels. High blood total- and low density lipoprotein (LDL)-cholesterol levels are major modifiable risk factors
in the development of coronary heart disease. High coronary heart disease rates occur among people with high blood
cholesterol levels of 240 mg per decaliter (mg/dL) (6.21 millimoles per liter (mmol/L) or above and LDL-cholesterol
levels of 160 mg/dL (4.13 mmol/L) or above. Borderline high risk blood cholesterol levels range from 200 to 239 mg/dL
(5.17 to 6.18 mmol/L) and 130 to 159 mg/dL (3.36 to 4.11 mmol/L) of LDL-cholesterol. Dietary lipids (fats) include
fatty acids and cholesterol. Total fat, commonly referred to as fat, is composed of saturated fat (fatty acids containing
no double bonds), and monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fat (fatty acids containing one or more double bonds).

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) The scientific evidence establishes that diets high in saturated fat and cholesterol are associated with increased
levels of blood total- and LDL-cholesterol and, thus, with increased risk of coronary heart disease. Diets low in
saturated fat and cholesterol are associated with decreased levels of blood total- and LDL-cholesterol and, thus,
with decreased risk of developing coronary heart disease. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Significance of the relationship between dietary saturated fat and cholesterol and risk of coronary heart disease.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(i) Coronary heart disease is a major public health concern in the United States, primarily because it accounts for
more deaths than any other disease or group of diseases. Early management of risk factors for coronary heart disease
is a major public health goal that can assist in reducing risk of coronary heart disease. There is a continuum of mortality
risk from coronary heart disease that increases with increasing levels of blood LDL-cholesterol. Individuals with
high blood LDL-cholesterol are at greatest risk. A larger number of individuals with more moderately elevated cholesterol
also have increased risk of coronary events; such individuals comprise a substantial proportion of the adult U.S.
population. The scientific evidence indicates that reducing saturated fat and cholesterol intakes lowers blood
LDL-cholesterol and risk of heart disease in most individuals. There is also evidence that reducing saturated fat
and cholesterol intakes in persons with blood cholesterol levels in the normal range also reduces risk of heart disease.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) Other risk factors for coronary heart disease include a family history of heart disease, high blood pressure,
diabetes, cigarette smoking, obesity, and lack of regular physical exercise. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) Intakes of saturated fat exceed recommended levels in many people in the United States. Intakes of cholesterol
are, on average, at or above recommended levels. One of the major public health recommendations relative to coronary
heart disease risk is to consume less than 10 percent of calories from saturated fat, and an average of 30 percent or
less of total calories from all fat. Recommended daily cholesterol intakes are 300 mg or less.

Model health claims. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The following model health claims may be used in food labeling to describe the relationship between dietary saturated
fat and cholesterol and risk of heart disease: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) While many factors affect heart disease, diets low in saturated fat and cholesterol may reduce the risk of this
disease. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) Development of heart disease depends upon many factors, but its risk may be reduced by diets low in saturated fat
and cholesterol and healthy lifestyles. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) Development of heart disease depends on many factors, including a family history of the disease, high blood
LDL-cholesterol, diabetes, high blood pressure, being overweight, cigarette smoking, lack of exercise, and the
type of dietary pattern. A healthful diet low in saturated fat, total fat, and cholesterol, as part of a healthy lifestyle,
may lower blood cholesterol levels and may reduce the risk of heart disease. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iv) Many factors, such as family history of the disease, increased blood total- and LDL-cholesterol levels, high
blood pressure, cigarette smoking, diabetes, and being overweight, contribute to developing heart disease. Eating
a diet low in saturated fat, cholesterol, and total fat may help reduce the risk of heart disease. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(v) Diets low in saturated fat, cholesterol, and total fat may reduce the risk of heart disease. Heart disease is dependent
upon many factors, including diet, a family history of the disease, elevated blood LDL-cholesterol levels, and physical
inactivity.

Relationship between diets low in fat and high in fiber-containing grain products, fruits, and vegetables and cancer
risk. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(i) Cancer is a constellation of more than 100 different diseases, each characterized by the uncontrolled growth
and spread of abnormal cells. Cancer has many causes and stages in its development. Both genetic and environmental
risk factors may affect the risk of cancer. Risk factors include a family history of a specific type of cancer, cigarette
smoking, alcohol consumption, overweight and obesity, ultraviolet or ionizing radiation, exposure to cancer-causing
chemicals, and dietary factors. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) The scientific evidence establishes that diets low in fat and high in fiber-containing grain products, fruits,
and vegetables are associated with a reduced risk of some types of cancer. Although the specific role of total dietary
fiber, fiber components, and the multiple nutrients and other substances contained in these foods are not fully understood,
many studies have shown that diets low in fat and high in fiber-containing foods are associated with reduced risk of
some types of cancer.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Significance of the relationship between consumption of diets low in fat and high in fiber-containing grain products,
fruits, and vegetables and risk of cancer. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(i) Cancer is ranked as a leading cause of death in the United States. The overall economic costs of cancer, including
direct health care costs and losses due to morbidity and mortality, are very high. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) U.S. diets tend to be high in fat and low in grain products, fruits, and vegetables. Studies in various parts of
the world indicate that populations who habitually consume a diet high in plant foods have lower risks of some cancers.
These diets are generally low in fat and rich in many nutrients, including, but not limited to, dietary fiber. Current
dietary guidelines from the Federal Government and nationally recognized health professional organizations recommend
decreased consumption of fats (less than 30 percent of calories), maintenance of desirable body weight, and increased
consumption of fruits and vegetables (five or more servings daily), and grain products (six or more servings daily).

. The following model health claims may be used in food labeling to characterize the relationship between diets low
in fat and high in fiber-containing grain products, fruits, and vegetables and cancer risk: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) Low fat diets rich in fiber-containing grain products, fruits, and vegetables may reduce the risk of some types
of cancer, a disease associated with many factors. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Relationship between diets low in saturated fat and cholesterol and high in fruits, vegetables, and grain products
that contain fiber, particularly soluble fiber, and risk of coronary heart disease
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. (i) Cardiovascular disease means diseases of the heart and circulatory system. Coronary heart disease is the most
common and serious form of cardiovascular disease and refers to diseases of the heart muscle and supporting blood
vessels. High blood total- and low density lipoprotein (LDL)-cholesterol levels are major modifiable risk factors
in the development of coronary heart disease. High coronary heart disease rates occur among people with high blood
cholesterol levels of 240 mg per decaliter (mg/dL) (6.21 millimoles per liter (mmol/L) or above and LDL-cholesterol
levels of 160 mg/dL (4.13 mmol/L) or above. Borderline high risk blood cholesterol levels range from 200 to 239 mg/dL
(5.17 to 6.18 mmol/L) and 130 to 159 mg/dL (3.36 to 4.11 mmol/L) of LDL-cholesterol. Dietary lipids (fats) include
fatty acids and cholesterol. Total fat, commonly referred to as fat, is composed of saturated fat (fatty acids containing
no double bonds), and monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fat (fatty acids containing one or more double bonds).

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) The scientific evidence establishes that diets high in saturated fat and cholesterol are associated with increased
levels of blood total- and LDL-cholesterol and, thus, with increased risk of coronary heart disease. Diets low in
saturated fat and cholesterol are associated with decreased levels of blood total- and LDL-cholesterol and, thus,
with decreased risk of developing coronary heart disease. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) Populations with relatively low blood cholesterol levels tend to have dietary patterns that are not only low
in total fat, especially saturated fat and cholesterol, but are also relatively high in fruits, vegetables, and grain
products. Although the specific roles of these plant foods are not yet fully understood, many studies have shown that
diets high in plant foods are associated with reduced risk of coronary heart disease. These studies correlate diets
rich in fruits, vegetables, and grain products and nutrients from these diets, such as some types of fiber, with reduced
coronary heart disease risk. Persons consuming these diets frequently have high intakes of dietary fiber, particularly
soluble fiber. Currently, there is not scientific agreement as to whether a particular type of soluble fiber is beneficial,
or whether the observed protective effects of fruits, vegetables, and grain products against heart disease are due
to other components, or a combination of components, in these diets, including, but not necessarily limited to, some
types of soluble fiber, other fiber components, other characteristics of the complex carbohydrate content of these
foods, other nutrients in these foods, or displacement of saturated fat and cholesterol from the diet.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Significance of the relationship between diets low in saturated fat and cholesterol and high in fruits, vegetables,
and grain products that contain fiber, particularly soluble fiber, and risk of coronary heart disease
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. (i) Coronary heart disease is a major public health concern in the United States, primarily because it accounts for
more deaths than any other disease or group of diseases. Early management of risk factors for coronary heart disease
is a major public health goal that can assist in reducing risk of coronary heart disease. There is a continuum of mortality
risk from coronary heart disease that increases with increasing levels of blood LDL-cholesterol. Individuals with
high blood LDL-cholesterol are at greatest risk. A larger number of individuals with more moderately elevated cholesterol
also have increased risk of coronary events; such individuals comprise a substantial proportion of the adult U.S.
population. The scientific evidence indicates that reducing saturated fat and cholesterol intakes lowers blood
LDL-cholesterol and risk of heart disease in most individuals, including persons with blood cholesterol levels
in the normal range. Additionally, consuming diets high in fruits, vegetables, and grain products, foods that contain
soluble fiber, may be a useful adjunct to a low saturated fat and low cholesterol diet.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(ii) Other risk factors for coronary heart disease include a family history of heart disease, high blood pressure,
diabetes, cigarette smoking, obesity, and lack of regular physical exercise. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) Intakes of saturated fat exceed recommended levels in many people in the United States. Intakes of cholesterol
are, on average, at or above recommended levels. Intakes of fiber-containing fruits, vegetables, and grain products
are about half of recommended intake levels. One of the major public health recommendations relative to coronary
heart disease risk is to consume less than 10 percent of calories from saturated fat, and an average of 30 percent or
less of total calories from all fat. Recommended daily cholesterol intakes are 300 mg or less. Recommended total dietary
fiber intakes are about 25 g daily, of which about 25 percent (about 6 g) should be soluble fiber. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iv) Current dietary guidance recommendations encourage decreased consumption of dietary fat, especially saturated
fat and cholesterol, and increased consumption of fiber-rich foods to help lower blood LDL-cholesterol levels.
Results of numerous studies have shown that fiber-containing fruits, vegetables, and grain products can help lower
blood LDL-cholesterol.

Relationship between substances in diets low in fat and high in fruits and vegetables and cancer risk.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (i) Cancer is a constellation of more than 100 different diseases, each characterized by the uncontrolled growth
and spread of abnormal cells. Cancer has many causes and stages in its development. Both genetic and environmental
risk factors may affect the risk of cancer. Risk factors include a family history of a specific type of cancer, cigarette
smoking, alcohol consumption, overweight and obesity, ultraviolet or ionizing radiation, exposure to cancer-causing
chemicals, and dietary factors.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) Although the specific roles of the numerous potentially protective substances in plant foods are not yet understood,
many studies have shown that diets high in plant foods are associated with reduced risk of some types of cancers. These
studies correlate diets rich in fruits and vegetables and nutrients from these diets, such as vitamin C, vitamin A,
and dietary fiber, with reduced cancer risk. Persons consuming these diets frequently have high intakes of these
nutrients. Currently there is not scientific agreement as to whether the observed protective effects of fruits and
vegetables against cancer are due to a combination of the nutrient components of diets rich in fruits and vegetables,
including but not necessarily limited to dietary fiber, vitamin A as 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
beta
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
-carotene, and vitamin C, to displacement of fat from such diets, or to intakes of other substances in these foods which

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Significance of the relationship between consumption of diets low in fat and high in fruits and vegetables and risk
of cancer.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (i) Cancer is ranked as a leading cause of death in the United States. The overall economic costs of cancer, including
direct health care costs and losses due to morbidity and mortality, are very high.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) U.S. diets tend to be high in fat and low in fruits and vegetables. Studies in various parts of the world indicate
that populations who habitually consume a diet high in plant foods have lower risk of some cancers. These diets are
generally low in fat and rich in many nutrients, including but not limited to, dietary fiber, vitamin A as 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
beta
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
-carotene, and vitamin C. Current dietary guidelines from the Federal Government and nationally recognized health
professional organizations recommend decreased consumption of fats (less than 30 percent of calories), maintenance
of desirable body weight, and increased consumption of fruits and vegetables (five or more servings daily), particularly
those fruits and vegetables which contain dietary fiber, vitamin A, and vitamin C.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The following model health claims may be used in food labeling to characterize the relationship between substances
in diets low in fat and high in fruits and vegetables and cancer:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) Low fat diets rich in fruits and vegetables (foods that are low in fat and may contain dietary fiber, vitamin A, and
vitamin C) may reduce the risk of some types of cancer, a disease associated with many factors. Broccoli is high in vitamins
A and C, and it is a good source of dietary fiber.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) Development of cancer depends on many factors. Eating a diet low in fat and high in fruits and vegetables, foods
that are low in fat and may contain vitamin A, vitamin C and dietary fiber, may reduce your risk of some cancers. Oranges,
a food low in fat, are a good source of fiber and vitamin C.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Relationship between folate and neural tube defects.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (i) Neural tube defects are serious birth defects of the brain or spinal cord that can result in infant mortality or
serious disability. The birth defects anencephaly and spina bifida are the most common forms of neural tube defects
and account for about 90 percent of these defects. These defects result from failure of closure of the covering of the
brain or spinal cord during early embryonic development. Because the neural tube forms and closes during early pregnancy,
the defect may occur before a woman realizes that she is pregnant.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) The available data show that diets adequate in folate may reduce the risk of neural tube defects. The strongest
evidence for this relationship comes from an intervention study by the Medical Research Council of the United Kingdom
that showed that women at risk of recurrence of a neural tube defect pregnancy who consumed a supplement containing
4 mg (4,000 micrograms (mcg)) folic acid daily had a reduced risk of having a child with a neural tube defect. (Products
that contain this level of folic acid are drugs.) In addition, based on its review of a Hungarian intervention trial
that used a multivitamin and multimineral preparation containing 800 mcg (0.8 mg) of folic acid, and its review of
the observational studies that reported use of multivitamins containing 0 to 1,000 mcg of folic acid, FDA concluded
that most of these studies had results consistent with the conclusion that folate, at levels attainable in usual diets,
may reduce the risk of neural tube defects.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Significance of folate.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (i) Neural tube defects occur in approximately 0.6 of 1,000 live births in the United States (i.e., about 2,500 cases
among 4 million live births annually). Neural tube defects are believed to be caused by many factors. The single greatest
risk factor for a neural tube defect-affected pregnancy is a personal or family history of a pregnancy affected with
such a defect. However, about 90 percent of infants with a neural tube defect are born to women who do not have a family
history of these defects. The available evidence shows that diets adequate in folate may reduce the risk of neural
tube defects but not of other birth defects.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) Prevalence rates for neural tube defects have been reported to vary with a wide range of factors, including genetics,
geography, socioeconomic status, maternal birth cohort, month of conception, race, nutrition, and maternal age
and reproductive history. Women with a close relative (i.e., sibling, niece, nephew) with a neural tube defect, those
with insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus, and women with seizure disorders who are being treated with valproic
acid or carbamazepine are at significantly increased risk compared with women without these characteristics. Rates
for neural tube defects vary within the United States, with lower rates observed on the west coast than on the east coast.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) Based on a synthesis of the results of several observational studies, the Public Health Service has estimated
that about 50 percent of neural tube defect-affected pregnancies in the United States (e.g., about 1,250) may be averted
annually if all women consume adequate amounts of folate daily (i.e., 0.4 mg) throughout their childbearing years.

The following are examples of model health claims that may be used in food labeling to describe the relationship between
folate and neural tube defects: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) Women who consume adequate amounts of folate, a B vitamin, daily throughout their childbearing years may reduce
their risk of having a child with a neural tube birth defect. Such birth defects, while not widespread, are very serious.
They can have many causes. Adequate amounts of folate can be obtained from diets rich in fruits, dark green leafy vegetables
and legumes, enriched grain products, fortified cereals, or a supplement. Folate consumption should be limited
to 1,000 mcg per day from all sources. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) Women who consume adequate amounts of folate daily throughout their childbearing years may reduce their risk
of having a child with a birth defect of the brain and spinal cord. Such birth defects, while not widespread, are very
serious. They can have many causes. Adequate amounts of folate, a B vitamin, can be obtained from diets rich in fruits,
dark green leafy vegetables and legumes, enriched grain products, fortified cereals, or a supplement. Women who
have had a child with a spinal cord birth defect should consult a physician before becoming pregnant. Folate consumption
should be limited to 1,000 mcg per day from all sources. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) Women who take steps to ensure that their folate intake is adequate throughout their childbearing years may
reduce their risk of having a child with a neural tube defect. Such birth defects, while not widespread, are very serious.
They can have many causes. Adequate amounts of folate, a B vitamin, can be obtained from diets rich in citrus fruits
and juices, dark green leafy vegetables and legumes, enriched grain products such as breads, rice, and pasta, fortified
cereals, or a supplement. Folate consumption should be limited to 1,000 mcg per day from all sources. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iv) Women who take steps to ensure that their folate intake is at least 400 mcg daily throughout their childbearing
years may reduce their risk of having a child with spina bifida or anencephaly, birth defects of the brain or spinal
cord that, while not widespread, are very serious. These birth defects can have many causes. Adequate amounts of folate,
a B vitamin, can be obtained from diets rich in fruits, including citrus fruits and juices, vegetables, including
dark green leafy vegetables and legumes, enriched grain products, including breads, rice, and pasta, fortified
cereals, or from a supplement. Women who have had a pregnancy affected with a neural tube defect should consult a physician
before becoming pregnant. Folate consumption should be limited to 1,000 mcg per day from all sources. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(v) Some women who consume the Daily Value of folate (400 mcg) throughout their childbearing years may reduce their
risk of having a child affected with spina bifida or anencephaly, birth defects of the brain or spinal cord that, while
not widespread, are very serious. These birth defects can have many causes. Women of childbearing age should choose
well-balanced diets that include 2 to 4 servings per day of fruits (including citrus fruits and juices), 3 to 5 servings
of vegetables (including dark green leafy vegetables and legumes), 6 to 11 servings of enriched grain products (such
as breads, rice, and pasta) or fortified cereals throughout their childbearing years. Such diets provide many essential
minerals and vitamins, including folate. Women who may be concerned about their diets may choose to obtain folate
from a supplement. Folate consumption should be limited to 1,000 mcg per day from all sources.

The petitions were submitted pursuant to section 251 of the Trade Act of 1974 (19 U.S.C. 2341). Consequently, the United
States Department of Commerce has initiated separate investigations to determine whether increased imports into
the United States of articles like or directly competitive with those produced by each firm contributed importantly
total or partial separation of the firm's workers, or threat thereof, and to a decrease in sales or production of each
petitioning firm.

<DOCTITLE>Notice of Intent To Prepare an Environmental Impact Statement for Construction and Operation of a Relocatable Over
the Horizon Radar, PR</DOCTITLE>
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Pursuant to Section 102(2)(C) of the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969, as implemented by the Council on Environmental
Quality Regulations (40 CFR parts 1500&hyph;1508), and the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico Public Law Number Nine, Section
4(c), the Department of Navy, in coordination with the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, announces its intent to prepare
an Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) to evaluate the potential environmental effects of constructing and operating
a Relocatable Over the Horizon Radar (ROTHR) system, Puerto Rico.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The ROTHR is a land-based, wide area surveillance, high frequency (HF), radar system, which permits detection and
tracking of aircraft, and supports requirements for the early detection and monitoring of illegal drug activity.
The installation of the ROTHR in Puerto Rico is proposed as an addition to the national and local counter-narcotic
strategy by focusing detection and enforcement efforts at their sources. It will complement ROTHR systems in Virginia
and Texas and other surveillance installations to provide virtually complete coverage of the Caribbean Basin and
the northern portion of South America.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The ROTHR system has three components; Transmitter, Receiver, and an Operation Control Center. The proposed action
would locate a Transmitter on Vieques Island and a Receiver in southwestern Puerto Rico. The Operation Control Center
functions will be performed at a currently existing facility in Norfolk, Virginia. The Transmitter will require
approximately 100 acres of land, and will consist of 34 metal, vertical antenna towers and 34 wooden, vertical poles,
supporting a curtain of antenna wires. Towers would range in height from 71 feet to 125 feet. The Receiver will require
approximately 200 acres of land, and will consist of 372 pairs of aluminum, monopole antennas, each about 17 feet high
and extending approximately 8,600 linear feet.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Alternatives for both the Transmitter and Receiver sites, including the no action alternative, will be addressed
in the EIS. Three Transmitter site alternatives are located on Navy property on Vieques Island, two in the Camp Garcia
area and one north of Playa Grande. No preferred alternative for the Transmitter site has been identified. A preferred
alternative for the Receiver site is located on private property in the Valle de Lajas, northwest of the Ensenada Community,
Guanica and southeast of the town of Lajas. The Puerto Rico Industrial Development Corporation (PRIDCO) would obtain
individual leases from property owners and assemble these as one lease to the Navy. Alternative Receiver sites, another
in the Valle de Lajas and a site east of the city of Salinas, have also been identified.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Major environmental issues identified to be addressed in the EIS include wetlands, threatened and endangered species,
floodplains, historic and pre-historic cultural resources, soil erosion, aesthetics, and electromagnetic effects.
The Draft EIS is planned to be available to the public in early 1995.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department of the Navy will hold two public scoping meetings to ensure that all interested parties have the opportunity
to identify significant issues related to the proposed action. Scoping meetings will be held as follows:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;June 9, 1994 from 7:30 p.m. to 9:30 p.m. at the Community Center (main street next to public library), La Parguera,
PR.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;June 11, 1994 from 10:30 a.m. to 12:30 p.m. at the Municipal Assembly Hall, Vieques, PR.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Following a brief overview of the proposed action (presented in both English and Spanish at each scoping meeting),
comments will be heard. Each attendee will be requested to indicate, when registering, whether he/she intends to
deliver oral comments at the meeting. Comments may be made in either English or Spanish and will be translated sequentially
in summary form. In the interest of available time, each speaker will be asked to limit oral comments to five minutes.
All interested federal, Commonwealth, and local agencies, and interested persons are invited and encouraged to
attend one or both of these meetings to submit comments in writing as described below.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Written statements and/or questions regarding the scoping process should be mailed to: Commander, Atlantic Division,
Naval Facilities Engineering Command, Norfolk, Virginia 23511&hyph;6287, Attn: Ms. Linda Blount (Code 2032LB),

Budget (OMB) provide interested Federal agencies and the public an early opportunity to comment on information collection
requests. OMB may amend or waive the requirement for public consultation to the extent that public participation
in the approval process would defeat the purpose of the information collection, violate State or Federal law, or substantially
interfere with any agency's ability to perform its statutory obligations. The Acting Director of the Information
Resources Management Service, publishes this notice containing proposed information collection requests prior
to submission of these request to OMB. Each proposed information collection, grouped by office, contains the following:
(1) Type of review requested, e.g., new, revision, extension, existing or reinstatement; (2) Title; (3) Frequency
of collection; (4) The affected public; (5) Reporting burden; and/or (6) Recordkeeping burden; and (7) Abstract.

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Department of Energy seeks to address the concerns of affected parties regarding the continued storage of spent
nuclear fuel at reactor sites beyond 1998. Through this Notice of Inquiry, the Department desires to elicit the views
of affected parties on: (1) The Department's preliminary view that it does not have a statutory obligation to accept
spent nuclear fuel in 1998 in the absence of an operational repository or a suitable storage facility constructed
under the Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982, as amended; (2) the need for an interim, away-from-reactor storage facility
prior to repository operations; and (3) options for offsetting, through the use of the Nuclear Waste Fund, a portion
of the financial burden that may be incurred by utilities in continuing to store spent nuclear fuel at reactor sites
beyond 1998. While seeking these comments, the Department remains committed to pursuing the permanent disposal

A. The Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982, as amended, [Act], 42 U.S.C. 10101 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et seq
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
., provides a comprehensive framework for disposal of commercial spent nuclear fuel and high-level radioactive
waste. Section 302 of the Act established the Nuclear Waste Fund and required owners and generators of spent nuclear
fuel and high-level waste to pay fees into the Nuclear Waste Fund sufficient to ensure the full-cost recovery of all
program expenditures. Section 302(a) authorized the Secretary to enter into contracts with the owners and generators
of spent nuclear fuel and high-level waste of domestic origin [herein referred to as ``utility''] for the acceptance
and disposal of such wastes. Section 302(a)(5) of the Act further stipulated that these contracts shall provide that
the Secretary shall take title to the spent nuclear fuel or high-level waste as expeditiously as practicable following
commencement of operation of a repository and that, in return for payment of the fees established by this section,
the Secretary, beginning not later than January 31, 1998, will dispose of these wastes.

B. Standard Contract for Disposal of Spent Nuclear Fuel and/or High-Level Radioactive Waste 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Department implemented Section 302(a) of the Act through rulemaking under which it promulgated the Standard
Contract for Disposal of Spent Nuclear Fuel and/or High-Level Radioactive Waste (Standard Contract) (48 FR 16590,
codified at 10 CFR part 961), which was published on April 18, 1983. Article II of the Standard Contract states that
``the services to be provided by DOE [Department of Energy] under this contract shall begin, after commencement of
facility operations, not later than January 31, 1998 *&blank;*&blank;*''. The use of the term ``facility'' in the
Standard Contract, as contrasted with the use of the term ``repository'' in the Act, was in recognition that a Monitored
Retrievable Storage (MRS) facility may be available before a repository and could meet the intent of the statute.

C. Development of a Repository and a MRS 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
When the Act was passed, the Department anticipated that a geologic repository would be in operation and prepared
to begin acceptance of spent nuclear fuel by January 31, 1998. As indicated above, when the Standard Contract was promulgated,
the Department envisioned that it would have a waste management facility in operation and would be prepared to begin
acceptance of spent nuclear fuel by January 31, 1998. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Act provides for a comprehensive site selection and site characterization process, wherein the Department makes
a recommendation to the President for approval of a repository. Currently, the Yucca Mountain site in Nevada is the
only site authorized by the Congress for site characterization. Should Yucca Mountain prove scientifically suitable,
and be licensed by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission and approved by the Congress, the Department currently projects
that the earliest possible date for acceptance of waste for disposal at a repository is 2010. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
With respect to availability of an MRS to accept and temporarily store spent nuclear fuel, the Nuclear Waste Policy
Amendments Act of 1987 (Amendments Act) linked the development schedule for an MRS facility to the geologic repository.
The Amendments Act precludes the Department from selecting an MRS site until a repository site is recommended to the
President, and MRS construction may not be started until a construction authorization for a repository is received
from the Nuclear Regulatory Commission. Given these timing restrictions, the Department has looked to the negotiated
siting process, administered by the Nuclear Waste Negotiator, and a negotiated agreement proposing a site to the
Congress as the appropriate mechanism for achieving the 1998 waste acceptance target. Experience has shown that
there are significant challenges associated with siting any facility of this type. Thus far, neither the efforts
of the Department nor any other organization, including the Office of the Nuclear Waste Negotiator, have achieved
the level of success needed to realize significant progress in locating and developing a site by 1998. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In an April 1, 1993, letter to the Secretary of Energy, the National Association of Regulatory Utility Commissioners
(NARUC) proposed that a collaborative dialogue be initiated to identify and develop constructive recommendations
for the Secretary and others for their consideration in evaluating alternatives for interim spent nuclear fuel storage.
In order to establish a dialogue whose participants represented a broad range of affected interests, NARUC extended
invitations to state utility regulators, nuclear utility executives, environmental groups, and representatives
from the State of Nevada. Individuals from the Department of Energy and the Nuclear Regulatory Commission were invited
to provide technical assistance. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Over the course of three meetings, the participants identified alternatives for interim storage of spent nuclear
fuel, and considered the advantages and disadvantages of each. On February 25, 1994, NARUC issued the Report and Recommendations
of the NARUC Dialogue on Spent Fuel Management, presenting the results of this stakeholder dialogue. In summary,
the majority findings of the NARUC dialogue were that:

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
Centralized off-site interim storage of spent fuel is far preferable to on-site storage at reactor sites throughout
the country. The federal government should take immediate action to establish centralized interim storage capability
by 1998, including the commencement of an effort to develop such capability at one or more federal sites. This represents
a sensible, safe, economic approach to meeting the nation's near term spent fuel management needs. The participants
recognize that Congressional action is necessary to effectuate many of the recommendations. They also recognize
that this is a difficult issue and are ready to actively assist the federal government in discharging its responsibilities.

D. The Department's Waste Acceptance Obligation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Many utilities have maintained that certain terms in the Act and the Standard Contract created an unconditional obligation
on behalf of the Department to begin accepting spent nuclear fuel in 1998. Some of these utilities have informed the
Department that they have implemented long term waste management plans based on this interpretation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department's preliminary view is that it has no statutory obligation to accept spent nuclear fuel beginning in
1998 in the absence of an operational repository or other facility constructed under the Act, although the Department
in implementing the Standard Contract may have created an expectation that it would begin accepting such spent nuclear
fuel in 1998. Accordingly, the Secretary has indicated her intent to explore with affected parties various options
and methods for sharing the costs related to the financial burden associated with continued on-site storage. Any
form of cost sharing offered through the Nuclear Waste Fund is not intended to fulfill the Department's ultimate obligation
under the Standard Contract to take title to and physical possession of spent nuclear fuel once a facility constructed
under the Act is operational. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
E. Purpose of Notice 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This Notice of Inquiry is intended to implement the Secretary's initiative by eliciting the views of affected parties
on: (1) The Department's preliminary view that it does not have a statutory obligation to accept spent nuclear fuel
in 1998 in the absence of an operational repository or other facility constructed under the Act; (2) the need for an
interim, away-from-reactor storage facility prior to repository operations; and (3) options for offsetting, through
the use of the Nuclear Waste Fund, a portion of the financial burden that may be incurred by utilities in continuing
to store spent nuclear fuel at reactor sites beyond 1998. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Should the Department proceed with some form of cost sharing, each utility would be offered an opportunity to modify
its Standard Contract. As a condition of such cost sharing, it is possible that the Department may require a release,
in whole or in part, of potential contractual liability arising out of any obligation to accept waste prior to commencement
of repository operation or the operation of another facility constructed under the Act. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department recognizes that there are a number of potential forms of cost sharing arrangements, but at this time,
the Department has not reached a decision whether to proceed with, nor is it predisposed to, any particular form of
cost sharing. Currently, the Department is evaluating a design for multi-purpose canisters (MPC) to support spent
nuclear fuel transportation, storage, and disposal. The MPC offers the potential for considerable standardization,
simplification and, consequently, cost savings for both utilities and the Federal waste management system. Given
the potential benefits of the MPC, the Secretary has directed that the options to be explored by the Department should
include, to the maximum extent possible, the provision and use of MPCs to address both schedule and cost concerns arising
from the potential unavailability of a repository or an MRS in 1998.

Cost Sharing Issues 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
&bull;Recognizing the full-cost recovery provision and the limitations imposed on the use of the Nuclear Waste Fund
by Section 302 of the Act, should the Department consider offering some form of cost sharing to utilities if it is unable
to begin accepting spent nuclear fuel by 1998? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;What basis should the Department use for establishing the order and timing by which such cost sharing is offered?

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;If it is found that such cost sharing may result in increased fees, should the Department continue pursuing
implementation of a cost-sharing program? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;If cost sharing involves the Department providing MPCs and the utilities paying the costs associated with
storage modules and other on-site storage related needs (e.g., costs of loading and handling operations), would
the extent of utility expenditures required by this approach affect whether utilities would use it? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;If the primary emphasis of a cost-sharing program were to be the provision of MPCs by the Department, what should
be done for utilities unable (e.g., those sites that are physically constrained from utilizing MPCs) or unwilling
to make use of MPCs? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;What other forms of cost sharing should the Department consider?

Take notice that on May 4, 1994, Mississippi River Transmission Corporation (MRT), 9900 Clayton Road, St. Louis,
Missouri 63124, filed in Docket No. CP94&hyph;524&hyph;000 a request pursuant to &sect;&sect;157.205 and 157.216
of the Commission's Regulations under the Natural Gas Act (18 CFR 157.205, 157.216) for authorization to abandon
in place approximately 600 feet of a lateral line formerly used to serve NL Industries' Steel Package Plant (NL Industries)
under MRT's blanket certificate issued in Docket No. CP82&hyph;489&hyph;000 pursuant to section 7 of the Natural
Gas Act, all as more fully set forth in the request that is on file with the Commission and open to public inspection.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
MRT states that NL Industries, formerly National Lead Company, was an industrial customer directly served by MRT.
In the past, MRT provided firm sales service to NL Industries at its Steel Package Plant in Granite City, Illinois.
This service was provided through an 8-inch lateral, Line A&hyph;4, which is located in Section 24, Township 3 North,
Range 10 West, Madison County, Illinois. MRT was authorized to construct and operate this line and provide sales service
to NL Industries in Docket No. G&hyph;291. MRT further states that no customer other than NL Industries is or has been
served by the portion of Line A&hyph;4 MRT proposes to abandon.

Take notice that on May 3, 1994, Washington Natural Gas Company, as Project Operator of the Jackson Prairie Storage
Project (Applicant), 815 Mercer Street, Seattle, Washington 98019, filed in Docket No. CP94&hyph;534&hyph;000
an application pursuant to &sect;157.7(a) of the Commission's Regulations to amend its certificate of public convenience
and necessity issued in the instant proceeding on March 21, 1991, which authorized the expansion of the seasonal and
daily capability of the Jackson Prairie Storage Project located in Lewis County, Washington (54 FERC &sect;61,325
(1991)), all as more fully set forth in the application on file with the Commission and open to public inspection. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Applicant states that the Jackson Prairie Storage Project is an aquifer type storage field which provides the storage
capacity under existing authorizations to enable Northwest Pipeline Corporation (Northwest) to provide a winter
season peaking service for its customers under Rate Schedules SGS&hyph;1 and SGS&hyph;2 in its FERC Gas Tariff, First
Revised Volume No. 1. Applicant further states that the Jackson Prairie Storage Project is connected to Northwest's
mainline in Lewis County, near Chehalis, Washington, and Applicant receives gas from Northwest at the interconnection,
transports the gas through the Project facilities, stores the gas in the Project and withdraws the gas on instructions
from Northwest and transports the gas and returns it to Northwest at the interconnection. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Applicant further states that the Storage Project is owned in joint and equal individual interests by Washington
Natural Gas Company (Washington Natural), the Washington Water Power Company and Northwest. Pursuant to agreement
among the owners, Washington Natural acts as the Project Operator. The Storage Project is operated pursuant to a Gas
Storage Project Agreement which is on file with the Commission as Washington Natural's Rate Schedule S&hyph;1 in
its FERC Gas Tariff Original Volume No. 1. Washington Natural states that the amendment is necessary in order to authorize
the construction of a 4,800 foot gathering line (16-inch) at a cost of $655,000. The new gathering line will connect
some of the existing wells with the compressor station in order to reduce the pressures against which the withdrawal
wells have to work during the withdrawal cycle. The gathering line is needed in order to increase the deliverability
of the withdrawal wells to achieve the certificated seasonal working gas quantity.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Texas Gas and AER state that by order issued October 10, 1979, in Docket Nos. CP79&hyph;351 and CP79&hyph;315, an exchange
service was authorized where Texas Gas was able to receive its share of natural gas from the Delta Drilling No. 1 Well
in Panola County, Texas, by means of AER receiving Texas Gas's share at AER's existing facilities in Panola County
and AER redelivering equivalent volumes less fuel to Texas Gas's facilities at the Union Pacific Resources Company
East Texas Plant, in Panola County, Texas. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Texas Gas and AER state there is no abandonment of any facilities pursuant to the instant application. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Texas Gas and AER indicate that Texas Gas's contract covering purchases from the Delta Drilling No. 1 Well terminated
on November 1, 1992, and Texas Gas no longer requires the exchange service provided by AER. Therefore, Texas Gas and
AER request authority to abandon the exchange service, effective April 12, 1994.

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 Public notice is hereby given in accordance with the provisions of seciton 1413 of the Safe Drinking Water Act as amended,
42 U.S.C. 300g&hyph;2, and 40 CFR part 142, subpart B-Primary Enforcement Responsibility, that the State of North
Dakota has revised its Public Water System Supervision (PWSS) Primacy Program. North Dakota's PWSS program, administered
by the North Dakota Division of Municipal Facilities, has adopted regulations for lead and copper that correspond
to the National Primary Drinking Water Regulations (NPDWR) in 40 CFR part 141 for lead and copper promulgated by EPA
on June 7, 1991 (56 FR 26460&hyph;26564). The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has completed its review of North
Dakota's primacy revision and has determined that it is no less stringent than the NPDWR for lead and copper. EPA therefore
approves North Dakota's primacy revision for the Lead and Copper Rule. This determination shall become effective
June 24, 1994.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Any interested parties are invited to submit written comments on this determination, and may request a public hearing
on or before June 24, 1994. If a public hearing is requested and granted, this determination shall not become effective
until such time following the hearing that the Regional Administrator issues an order affirming or rescinding this
action.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Requests for a public hearing should be addressed to: William P. Yellowtail, Regional Administrator, c/o Marty Swickard
(8WM-DW), U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, Region VIII, 999 18th Street, suite 500, Denver, CO 80202&hyph;2466.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Frivolous or insubstantial requests for a hearing may be denied by the Regional Administrator. However, if a substantial
request is made within thirty (30) days after this notice, a public hearing will be held.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Any request for a public hearing shall include the following: (1) The name, address, and telephone number of the individual,
organization, or other entity requesting a hearing; (2) a brief statement of the requesting person's interest in
the Regional Administrator's determination and of information that the requesting person intends to submit at such
hearing; and (3) the signature of the individual making the request, or, if the request is made on behalf of an organization
or other entity, the signature of the responsible official of the organization or other entity. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Notice of any hearing shall be given not less than fifteen (15) days prior to the time scheduled for the hearing. Such
notice will be made by the Regional Administrator in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 and in newspapers of general circulation in the State of North Dakota. A notice will also be sent to the person(s) requesting
the hearing as well as to the State of North Dakota. The hearing notice will include a statement of purpose, information
regarding time and location, and the address and telephone number where interested persons may obtain further information.
The Regional Administrator will issue an order affirming or rescinding his determination upon review of the hearing
record. Should the determination be affirmed, it will become effective as of the date of the order.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Should no timely and appropriate request for a hearing be received, and the Regional Administrator does not elect
to hold a hearing on his own motion, this determination shall become effective on June 24, 1994. Please bring this notice
to the attention of any persons known by you to have an interest in this determination. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

I. Cancellation For Maintenance Fee Non-Payment 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This registration is being canceled for non-payment of maintenance fees. Section 4(i)(5)(A) of FIFRA requires each
registrant of a pesticide to pay an annual maintenance fee to keep its pesticide registrations in effect (7 U.S.C.
136a(5)(A)). On January 15, 1994, the fee was due for Aladdin Winter Care (EPA Reg. No. 11329&hyph;17, Aladdin Chemical
Company, registrant). However, EPA allowed registrants until April 1, 1994, to remit maintenance fees. The registrant
did not pay its registration maintenance fee by April 1. This Notice therefore serves as the final cancellation order
for Aladdin Winter Care, or any other product with EPA Reg. No. 11329&hyph;17.

II. Risks Posed by Simazine in Swimming Pools 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Simazine, which is used primarily as an agricultural herbicide, is also used as an algaecide in swimming pools. The
swimming pool use accounts for less than 2 percent of total simazine usage. In 1989, EPA classified simazine as a Group
C possible human carcinogen, and in August 1993 EPA conducted a risk assessment of simazine swimming pool algaecide
products. The risk assessment revealed unacceptable cancer and non-cancer health risks to children and adults exposed
to water treated with simazine algaecides. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA's risk assessment is based on laboratory animal studies. These studies indicate that short-term exposure to
simazine may result in weight loss and reduced red blood cell count (anemia), which are reversible effects when exposure
is terminated. The studies also show that exposure to simazine poses a potential risk of cancer. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
III. Regulatory Background 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The three registrants of technical simazine--Ciba, Drexel Chemical, and Oxon-Italia--are not supporting the simazine
swimming pool use. None of Drexel Chemical's products are registered for aquatic use, and Ciba and Oxon-Italia ceased
supporting all aquatic uses prior to EPA's risk assessment. The aquatic-use cancellation for Ciba, the supplier
of technical simazine for the swimming pool products, became effective on October 9, 1992. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
After EPA completed its assessment of the risks of simazine in swimming pools, EPA notified the registrants of the
22 simazine swimming pool algaecide products of the cancer and non-cancer risks associated with simazine swimming
pool use. In view of these risks, nine of the thirteen end-use registrants agreed to request voluntary cancellation
with no allowance for the formulation, sale, distribution, or use of existing product stocks. They also agreed to
waive the comment period typically associated with such requests for voluntary cancellation. Because the nine companies
voluntarily requested cancellation and asked for a waiver of the comment period, EPA ordered the voluntary cancellation
of these 14 registrations--along with maintenance fee non-payment cancellations of 3 registrations--to become
effective on April 15, 1994 (59 FR 18120). Subsequently, Aladdin Chemical Company failed to pay the annual registration
maintenance fee for Aladdin Winter Care (EPA Reg. No. 11329&hyph;17). This registration fee non-payment is the subject
of this cancellation order. EPA is preparing cancellation actions against the registrations of the remaining 4 products,
which are held by Alden Leeds and N. Jonas Company. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
IV. Existing Stocks 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
EPA has determined that because of the potential cancer and non-cancer health risks, no sale, distribution, or use
of existing stocks will be permitted, except as specified in this Notice. For purposes of this order, existing stocks
are defined as those stocks of Aladdin Winter Care, or any other product with EPA Reg. No. 11329&hyph;17, that were
in the United States and were packaged, labeled, and released for shipment prior to May 25, 1994. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA has an established policy for determinations concerning the sale, distribution, and use of existing stocks of
canceled pesticides (56 FR 29362 (June 26, 1991)). That policy states that in cases where EPA has identified a significant
risk concern and the registration is canceled, EPA will make existing stocks determinations on a case-by-case basis.
In most cases, EPA will not permit the continued sale, distribution, or use of a canceled product raising risk concerns
unless it can be demonstrated that the benefits exceed the risks. EPA reserves the right to amend this existing stocks
provision, should conditions warrant such amendment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA has determined that it will not allow further distribution, sale, or use of existing stocks of any registered product
subject to this Notice by any person, except for (1) sale or distribution up through the chain of distribution to the
former registrant of that product, or (2) for lawful disposal. It is the responsibility of the basic registrant to
notify any and all supplementally registered distributors of their product(s) that this cancellation order also
applies to their supplementally registered products. Registrants may be held liable for violations committed by
their distributors. The swimming pool use of simazine poses unacceptable cancer and noncancer risks. Moreover,
information submitted to EPA does not demonstrate that the benefits of continued sale, distribution, and use of existing
stocks outweigh these risks. The benefits resulting from the use of existing stocks appear negligible, in that there
are more than 250 non-simazine algaecide products available for swimming pool use. According to EPA estimates, Aladdin
Winter Care's share of the swimming pool algaecide market is very small. Finally, EPA has taken steps that should have
reduced the amount of Aladdin Winter Care stocks currently in the hands of registrants, retailers, and distributors.
In December 1993, EPA notified registrants--including Aladdin Chemical Company--of the risks associated with
the products and asked them to stop formulating, selling, and distributing their products. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As a result of the cancellation order and existing stocks determination, a product subject to this Notice may only
be sold or distributed if it is both: (1) packaged, labeled, and released for shipment prior to May 25, 1994, and (2)
sold or distributed (a) up through the chain of distribution to the former registrant of the product, or (b) for lawful
disposal.

VI. Cancellation Order 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
I approve the cancellation of the above product, as well as the determination that from the date of this Notice, all
sale, distribution, and use of the existing stocks of this product is prohibited. Accordingly, this cancellation
order shall become effective May 25, 1994. Effective May 25, 1994, a product subject to this Notice may only be sold
or distributed if it is both: (1) packaged, labeled, and released for shipment prior to May 25, 1994, and (2) sold or
distributed (a) up through the chain of distribution to the former registrant of the product, or (b) for lawful disposal.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 Pursuant to section 18 of the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act (FIFRA) (7 U.S.C. 136p), the Administrator
may, at his discretion, exempt a State agency from any registration provision of FIFRA if he determines that emergency
conditions exist which require such exemption. The Applicant has requested the Administrator to issue a specific
exemption for use of the insecticide, 4-bromo-2-(4-chlorophenyl)5-(trifluoromethyl)-1
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

-pyrrole-3-carbonitrile, available as Pirate 3SC from American Cyanamid Company, to control beet armyworms (BAW)
on up to 180,000 acres of cotton in Alabama. Information in accordance with 40 CFR part 166 was submitted as part of this
request.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
According to the Applicant, BAW is a devastating pest of cotton which has caused excessive economic damage in certain
areas of Alabama every year since 1984. In 1993, BAW infested approximately 75 percent of the cotton acreage and caused
significant economic damage to 25 percent of Alabama's cotton crop. Although naturally occurring parasites and
predators of BAW will control this pest, phosphate insecticides which are applied to control another pest of cotton,
the boll weevil, reduce parasite and predator populations and disrupt the natural biological control of BAW, making
the use of pesticides necessary for control. According to the Applicant, the registered pesticides provide only
partial control of BAW. If Pirate Insecticide is not available for use, the Applicant claims that yield losses of up
to 25 percent may occur, resulting in economic losses of between $11 million and $58 million statewide.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under the proposed exemption, a maximum of two ground applications of Pirate 3SC would be made at 8.53 fluid ounces
of product (0.2 pounds active ingredient) per acre. No applications would be made within 21 days of harvest. A maximum
of 52,000 pounds of product would be needed to treat up to 180,000 acres of cotton.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 Pursuant to section 18 of the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act (FIFRA) (7 U.S.C. 136p), the Administrator
may, at his discretion, exempt a State agency from any registration provision of FIFRA if he determines that emergency
conditions exist which require such exemption. The Applicant has requested the Administrator to issue a specific
exemption for use of the insecticide, 4-bromo-2-(4-chlorophenyl)1-(ethoxymethyl)-5-(trifluoromethyl)-1
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=3 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
-pyrrole-3-carbonitrile, available as Pirate 3SC from American Cyanamid Company, to control beet armyworms (BAW)
on up to 350,000 acres of cotton in Mississippi. Information in accordance with 40 CFR part 166 was submitted as part
of this request.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
According to the Applicant, BAW is an occasional or sporadic pest of cotton in Mississippi. Recent outbreaks occurred
in 1988 and 1993, causing statewide losses of 1.6 percent and 4.4 percent, respectively. Although naturally occurring
parasites and predators of BAW will control this pest, phosphate insecticides which are applied to control another
pest of cotton, the boll weevil, reduce parasite and predator populations and disrupt the natural biological control
of BAW, making the use of pesticides necessary for control. According to the Applicant, the registered pesticides
provide only partial control of BAW. If Pirate Insecticide is not available for use, the Applicant claims that yield
losses of up to 25 percent may occur, resulting in economic losses of between $60 million and $216 million statewide.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under the proposed exemption, a maximum of two ground applications of Pirate 3SC would be made at 8.53 fluid ounces
of product (0.2 pounds active ingredient) per acre. No applications would be made within 21 days of harvest. A maximum
of 140,000 pounds of active ingredient would be needed to treat up to 350,000 acres of cotton.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This notice does not constitute a decision by EPA on the application itself. The regulations governing section 18
require that the Agency publish notice of receipt in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 and solicit public comment on an application for a specific exemption proposing use of a new chemical (i.e., an active
ingredient not contained in any currently registered pesticide) [40 CFR 166.24 (a)(1)]. 4-bromo-2-(4-chlorophenyl)-1(ethoxymethyl)-5-(trifluoromethyl)-1

 This notice announces the methodology that may be used by Medicare supplemental insurance policy (``Medigap'')
issuers to calculate the interest to be paid on premium credits and refunds due to Medicare beneficiaries. The Social
Security Act requires the insurers annually to issue refunds or credits when their loss ratios do not meet statutory
minimums and to pay interest from the end of the calendar year involved until the refund is made or the credit is applied.

I. Background 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Under the Medicare program, Medicare pays for certain services furnished to beneficiaries entitled to Medicare.
The beneficiary is, however, responsible for certain deductibles, coinsurance amounts, and charges, subject to
certain limits, that exceed the amount allowed by Medicare. The beneficiary is also responsible for charges for items
and services not covered by Medicare. He or she may purchase additional private insurance to help pay the costs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One type of private insurance beneficiaries may purchase is a Medicare supplemental policy, known as a Medigap policy.
These policies typically offer coverage of some or all of Medicare's deductible and coinsurance amounts and sometimes
include coverage of services not covered under Medicare. Section 1882 of the Social Security Act (the Act) sets forth
Federal standards applicable to Medigap policies.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under section 1882, no Medigap policy (as defined in section 1882(g)(1) of the Act) may be issued in a State unless it
complies with State laws that have been established in accordance with section 1882(b)(1) and have been approved
by the Health Care Financing Administration (HCFA). (While Federal certification under section 1882(c) would be
necessary in the absence of an approved State program, all States currently have approved programs.) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Among other requirements, section 1882(b)(1)(B) of the Act incorporates by reference the loss ratio provisions
of section 1882(r). Under section 1882(r)(1), a Medigap policy may not be issued or sold in any State unless it can be
expected to return a minimum level of benefits, calculated as a percentage of premiums. Under section 1882(r)(1)(B),
the issuer of the policy must provide for a proportional refund, or a credit against future premiums, if necessary
to assure to that loss ratio targets are met. Section 1882(r)(2)(C) requires that the refund or credit include interest
from the end of the policy year involved, at a rate specified by the Secretary that is not less than the average rate of
interest for 13-week Treasury notes. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 13.B of the Model Regulation to Implement the National Association of Insurance Commissioners (NAIC) Medicare
Supplement Insurance Minimum Standards Model Act, adopted by the NAIC on July 30, 1991, specifies how and when the
refund or credit calculation is to be done. The Model interprets ``policy year'' to mean ``calendar year.'' Appendix
A of the Model contains the reporting form that is to be used by issuers in reporting their loss ratio experience to the
State. This form must be submitted by May 31 of each year. The form requires that a description of the refund and/or credit
against premiums to be used be attached to the form. In order to describe the refund or credit, the insurer must know
how to calculate the interest rate.

II. Provisions of the Notice 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
There are several possible methods for calculating the interest rate. We expect to specify a single methodology that
will be applicable for future years in the context of formal rulemaking relating to section 1882 generally. However,
it is not possible to conclude that process in time for insurers to meet the May 31, 1994 deadline. The purpose of this
notice is to meet the needs of States that are requiring refunds and premium credits this year. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Until we specify otherwise, States may choose any reasonable methodology, subject to our approval. However, we have
determined that the methodology described below is an acceptable way to calculate the interest rate required by section
1882(r)(2)(C). If the State chooses this approach, no further approval is necessary. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
We have determined that it is reasonable to apply the same methodology that is used by HCFA when States have been overpaid
under the Medicaid program (title XIX of the Social Security Act). Under 42 CFR 433.38(d)(2), State repayments are
subject to interest charges at the rate HCFA determines to be the average of the bond equivalent of the weekly 90-day
Treasury bill auction rates during the period for which interest will be charged. (See 47 FR 29275; July 6, 1982). We
will find it acceptable if States apply the same methodology we use to implement this section. Specifically, we use
the unweighted average of the weekly auction average (investment) rates as published by the Federal Reserve. The
rates are applied as simple interest for the entire application period measured in days, assuming a 365-day calendar
year. The following table shows the rates for 1994 through the week ending April 22; however, any insurer can obtain
the rates independently from the Federal Reserve Statistical Release, which is made available each Monday. Information
on the availability of the release is available by telephoning (202) 452&hyph;3206.

 The National Cancer Institute (NCI) seeks an agreement with a pharmaceutical or biotechnology company for the joint
research, development, evaluation and possible commercialization of biomolecules involved in HIV entry into cells
and metastatic tumor cell invasion. Elucidation of such components will lead to the design of reagents which will
interfere with HIV entry and/or tumor invasion. These reagents will subsequently be tested on animal models and in
eventual clinical trials for their efficacy as therapeutic agents.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 Specific fusion of biological membranes is a central requirement for many cellular processes. It involves phenomena
such as intracellular sorting and secretion, cell division, fertilization, metastasis and viral entry into cells.
The research goals of the Membrane Structure and Function Section of the Laboratory of Mathematical Biology (LMMB);
Division of Cancer Biology; Diagnosis and Centers (DCBDC); National Cancer Institute (Dr. Robert Blumenthal, Chief)
have in the past years been directed towards an understanding how viral envelope proteins mediate fusion of membranes.
Dr. Blumenthal's group has developed new methodologies to examine the fusion activity of viral proteins.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The goal of this CRADA is to identify the biochemical components of the fusion complex involved in HIV entry into cells
and tumor cell invasion. A photosensitized labeling approach will be employed for the identification of membrane
fusion and cell adhesion molecules which may play an important role in HIV entry into cells and/or in metastatic cell
invasion. The use of the photosensitized labeling approach may make it possible to reveal the biological components
and proteins on cell surfaces (membranes) which could not previously be identified in any other way. Background information
(including reprints) is available from the above-referenced address. Selected peptide components of the fusion
complex will be purified and micro-sequenced in order to proceed with hybridization cloning of the accessary fusion
molecules. Reagents such as peptides and antibodies will then be generated using information derived from their
cDNA sequences. The reagents will be screened and tested for their ability to interfere with or block HIV infection
and/or metastatic cell invasion using in vitro assays. Potent inhibitors thus identified will be further tested
on animal models and in eventual clinical trials for their efficacy as therapeutic agents.

It has been shown that human CD4 inserted into non-human cells will not support HIV&hyph;1 entry into those cells.
Protease-insensitive components of human cells are needed to overcome the block in HIV&hyph;1 envelope glycoprotein-mediated
fusion of non-human cells. The plan is to identify those putative components using a new technique called photosensitized
labeling. By this methodology, lipophilic aryl azides are photoactivated in situ by energy transfer from a variety
of chromophores, using visible light. This approach has been successfully applied to the identification of proteins
and lipids involved in multidrug resistance of tumor cells and the process of invasion of human erythrocytes by the
Malaria parasite. Peptides derived from specific regions of gp 120 and gp 41 are labeled with fluorescein or other
chromophores and photoactivated during their interaction with CD4

I]-5-Iodonaphthalene-1-azide (INA). Since photoactivation occurs by resonance energy only, membrane components
in the vicinity of CD4 will be labeled by INA. The putative accessory proteins forming fusion complexes with gp 120
and CD4 will presumably be labeled, identified on 2D gels and isolated. The elucidation of such protease-insensitive
components will lead to the design of reagents which will interfere with or block HIV entry into cells. These reagents
will subsequently be tested on animal models and in eventual clinical trials for their efficacy as therapeutic agents
against HIV infection.

Metastasis: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
It has been shown that cytokine-induced pseudopodial protrusion is a prominent feature of actively motile cells
in vitro and invading tumor cells in vivo. Following protrusion of the pseudopodia through the basement membrane,
it has been postulated that fusion of adjacent pseudopods occurs. This is following by streaming of the cytoplasm
beneath the basement membranes, migration of the nucleus and finally, relocation of the cell to the opposite side
of the basement membrane. This process results in migration of the tumor cell towards the target tissue. The pseudopod
fusion process is presumably mediated by membrane fusion-inducing proteins which are transiently expressed during
cell migration across the basement membrane. For the identification of such proteins, a similar approach will be
used as that for identification of accessory components in HIV&hyph;1 envelope glycoprotein-mediated membrane
fusion: the chromophore will be placed on one population of cells and the

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
INA will be placed on another population of metastatic cell. Upon their penetration through basement membranes,
the pseudopodia of adjacent cells may fuse with one another. Fusion of a chromophore-labeled membrane with an

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
INA-bearing membrane will cause energy transfer between the chromophore and INA generating a measurable signal
in the form of radiolabeled proteins located at the site of fusion. The membrane proteins involved in metastatic cell
fusion and invasion will be identified on 2D gels and isolated. The elucidation of these proteins will lead to the design
of reagents which will interfere with or block tumor invasion into cells. These reagents will subsequently be tested
on animal models and in eventual clinical trials for their efficacy as therapeutic agents against tumor cell invasion.

CRADA aims include the rapid publication of research results and the timely exploitation of commercial opportunities.

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The National Institutes of Health seeks non-exclusive biological materials licensees to commercialize Whole Chromosome
Painting Probes (WCP probes) and Region Specific Painting Probes (Micro-FISH probes) generated by chromosome microdissection
and amplification of specific regions, and labelled for Fluorescent in situ Hybridization (FISH). The probes can
be hybridized to normal metaphase chromosomes and used as either diagnostic reagents for identification of chromosomal
abnormalities or as research reagents to further study various cancers and hereditary diseases. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
WCP probes for all human chromosomes are being generated using a universal primer. The probes are significantly superior
to current probes due to greater sensitivity and selectivity. The subject invention allows generation of probes
for the acrocentric chromosomes (13,14,15,21 and 22) by elimination of shared ribosomal elements between these
chromosomes. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
While numerous whole chromosome painting probes are presently available, most have technical limitations. Most
frequently, hybridization to portions of the target chromosome is incomplete because of gaps in the sequence. Additionally,
in many cases flow-sorted chromosomes in rodent backgrounds invariably transfer some sequences which make these
unusable for research analysis with somatic cell hybrids. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The WCP and Micro-FISH probes address these problems. The probes can be used to analyze complex chromosome rearrangements
in a variety of malignancies, clearly identifying chromosome rearrangements which could not be detected by conventional
banding analysis. The probes can also be generated to span translocation breakpoints and identify interstitial
deletions, both of which would confound conventionally created whole chromosome painting probes.

Beyond improvements in specificity and sensitivity, probes created by the micro-FISH method eliminate the microchemical
steps required by other methods by using a DNA oligonucleotide primer to directly prime DNA synthesis at intervals
along the microdissected DNA template. Accordingly, the procedure for probe preparation is dramatically simplified
and accelerated, and since the major losses associated with the microchemical process are largely eliminated, the
probes emit a stronger and more uniform signal intensity than other commonly available probes.

Act</DOCTITLE>
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In accordance with Department of Justice Policy, 28 CFR 50.7 38 FR 19029, notice is hereby given that on May 5, 1994,
a Compliant was filed and a proposed Consent Decree was lodged with the United States District Court for the Western
District of Washington in 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
United States 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
v. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Pacific Sound Resources, et al., 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Civil Action No. C94&hyph;687. The proposed Consent Decree settles claims asserted by the United States at the request
of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) for cleanup of releases of hazardous substances at the Wyckoff/Eagle
Harbor Superfund Site and the proposed Pacific Sound Resources Superfund Site, both in Seattle, Washington. The
Consent Decree also settles claims for natural resources damages at these two sites asserted by the National Oceanic
and Atmospheric Administration of the U.S. Department of Commerce, the U.S. Department of the Interior, the Suquamish
Indian Tribe, and the Muckleshoot Indian Tribe (the Natural Resource Trustees). The settling defendants include
Pacific Sound Resources, Inc. (PSR), which owns the sites and operates or formerly operated a wood treating facility
at each of them, a trust created to take ownership of the sites during cleanup, and officers and directors of PSR.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Complaint assets claims under Sections 106 and 107 of the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation,
and Liability Act (CERCLA), 42 U.S.C. 9606 and 9607. The Complaint seeks an order that the defendants implement remedial
actions selected by EPA at each site, that they reimburse all response and assessment costs incurred and to be incurred
by the plaintiffs, and that they pay damages for the injury to, destruction, and/or loss of use of natural resources
resulting from contamination at the sites.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under the Consent Decree, all assets of PSR will be transferred to a trust to ensure that they will be sold at an appropriate
time and that all proceeds will be devoted to cleanup and restoration of the Sites. The assets of PSR include several
parcels of potentially valuable real estate. The amount that will be obtained towards cleanup and restoration costs
under this agreement will depend in part on market conditions as the properties are sold.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department of Justice will receive written comments relating to the proposed Consent Decree for thirty (30) days
from the date of publication of this notice. Comments should be addressed to the Assistant Attorney General of the
Environment and Natural Resources Division, U.S. Department of Justice, Washington, DC 20530, and should refer
to

Summary of Facts and Representations 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
1. The Employer, a New York corporation with its corporate headquarters in Danbury, Connecticut, is a wholly owned
subsidiary of Novo Nordisk A/S, a Danish Corporation. The Plan is a profit sharing plan which includes a cash or deferred
arrangement under section 401(k) of the Code, and which provides for Employer matching contributions and additional
Employer discretionary profit sharing contributions. The Plan provides for participant direction with respect
to employee contributions and Employer matching contributions to the Plan. The Plan participants have the option
of investing in any of five investment funds: the GIC Fund, the First Union Managed Bond Portfolio, the First Union
Balanced Portfolio, The Diversified Equity Fund, and the Novo American Depository Receipt Fund. Participants have
the right to change their investments within and among the funds on a daily basis, except that participants may no longer
transfer amounts into or out of the GIC Fund to the extent that their account balance in that Fund is attributable to
the GIC issued by MBL. As of December 31, 1993, the Plan had approximately 225 participants and total assets of approximately
$5,600,000. The Plan's trustee is First Union Bank of North Carolina. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. The applicant represents that the GIC acquired from MBL was effective with respect to amounts deposited during
1987. The terms of the GIC provided for interest to be credited at the rate of 8.10% per annum until December 31, 1988,
and thereafter at the rate of 7.55% per annum until the maturity date of December 31, 1991. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. On July 16, 1991, MBL was placed into rehabilitation proceedings by the New Jersey Commissioner of Insurance. Consequently,
MBL has suspended payments on its guaranteed investment contracts, including the GIC held by the Plan. This situation
has prevented participants from exercising their rights under the Plan to request distributions, loans, and investment
transfers with respect to amounts currently invested in the GIC.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 As of December 31, 1991, the GIC had a total accumulated book value of $578,916.34.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Employer seeks an exemption to permit the Employer to make the Loan to the Plan in the amount due the Plan under the
GIC, plus interest through the date of the Loan. The Loan will be made pursuant to a written agreement between the Employer
and the Plan (the Agreement) incorporating the terms of the extension of credit and its repayment. The Employer represents
that it wishes to enter into the proposed transaction in order to protect the Plan participants from the effects of
a prolonged rehabilitation process and from any potential loss resulting from MBL's inability to meet its obligations
under the GIC. The Employer further represents that the Loan will enable the Plan to make timely payments under the
GIC and, therefore, enable the Plan participants to exercise their rights under the Plan to request distributions,
loans, and investment transfers with respect to amounts currently invested in the GIC. The Employer also represents
that the Loan will be non-interest bearing and the Plan will not incur any expenses in connection with the proposed
transaction.

4. The proposed Loan will be made in one lump-sum payment equal to the amounts deposited under the GIC, adjusted as follows:
(1) Interest is calculated at the guaranteed interest rate under the terms of the GIC until December 31, 1991, the maturity
date; and (2) the post-maturity interest rates will be calculated as follows:

It is represented that the proposed rate of interest for periods after the maturity date are the rates that would apply
to the GIC for those periods according to the proposed plan of rehabilitation set forth by the Superior Court of New
Jersey. Any proceeds paid from the GIC and received by the Plan on or before the Loan date will be subtracted from the
book value. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
5. Repayment of the Loan under the Agreement is limited to payments made to the Plan by or on behalf of MBL or its successor.
No other Plan assets will be available for repayment of the Loan. If the payments by or on behalf of MBL are not sufficient
to fully repay the Loan, the Agreement provides that the Employer will have no recourse against the Plan, or against
any participants or beneficiaries of the Plan, for the unpaid amount. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
6. In summary, the applicant represents that the proposed transaction satisfies the criteria of section 408(a) of
the Act because: (1) The Loan will enable the Plan to recover the total accumulated book value of the GIC as of the date
of maturity, plus interest thereafter; (2) The Plan will pay no interest nor incur any expenses with respect to the
Loan; (3) Repayment of the Loan will be restricted to payments made by or on behalf of MBL and no other Plan assets will
be involved; and (4) Repayment of the Loan will be waived to the extent the Plan recoups less from the payments by or on
behalf of MBL than the total amount of the Loan.

The Department is considering granting an exemption under the authority of section 408(a) of the Act and section 4975(c)(2)
of the Code and in accordance with the procedures set forth in 29 CFR Part 2570, Subpart B (55 FR 32836, 32847, August
10, 1990). If the exemption is granted, the restrictions of sections 406(a), 406(b)(1) and (b)(2) of the Act and the
sanctions resulting from the application of section 4975 of the Code, by reason of section 4975(c)(1)(A) through
(E) of the Code, shall not apply to the August 26, 1992 loan (the Loan) of $188,000 to the Plan by Hollingsworth &amp;
Vose Company (H&amp;V), provided the following conditions were satisfied: (a) No interest or expense was incurred
by the Plan with respect to the Loan; (b) the Loan enabled the Plan to effect the transfer of amounts held in participant
accounts to new investments made available under the Plan; (c) accounts transferred from the Plan's GIC Fund were
credited with amounts representing the allocable principal deposit in the GIC Fund plus accrued interest at the GIC
Fund rate; (d) accounts which remained invested in the GIC Fund continued to receive interest at the same rate; and
(e) repayment of the Loan was restricted to amounts held in or allocated to the GIC Fund, and no other plan assets were
used for that purpose. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Effective Dates: If the proposed exemption is granted, the exemption will be effective from August 26, 1992 through
November 10, 1992.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
Summary of Facts and Representations 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
1. H&amp;V is a corporation organized under the laws of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts engaged in the manufacture
of technical and industrial papers and nonwoven fabrics. The Plan is a profit sharing plan which contains a cash or
deferred arrangement under section 401(k) of the Code. The Plan is administered by the Savings Plan Committee (the
Committee) of H&amp;V. Under the Plan, participating employees make elective contributions pursuant to salary
reduction agreements. H&amp;V makes matching contributions not in excess of 6% of the participant's compensation.
The Plan had approximately 47 participants who were affected by the subject transaction, and at the time of the transaction
had assets with an approximate aggregate fair market value of $2,767,369. The Plan currently has assets of approximately
$4,361,700. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. Contributions under the Plan are allocated to the accounts of individual participants (the Accounts). The Accounts
are invested at the direction of participants in one or more of the investment options available under the Plan. Investment
directions may be made or changed as of January 1 and July 1 of each Plan year and remain in effect until changed by the
participant. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. Prior to July, 1992, two investment funds were available to participants, the Guaranteed Investment Contract
Fund (the GIC Fund) and the Fidelity Equity Income Fund. The investments held in the GIC Fund at that time consisted
of four contracts: (i) Fidelity Group Trust, at 8.33%, maturing on March 31, 1993; (ii) Vanguard Fixed Rate GIC Trust
II&hyph;90, at 8.17%, maturing March 31, 1993; (iii) Vanguard Fixed Rate GIC Trust II&hyph;91, at 7.45%, maturing
on March 31, 1994; and (iv) Principal Group Annuity Contract No. GA 4&hyph;3031, at 6.53%, maturing on March 31, 1995.
Participants who invested in the GIC Fund received interest at a combined rate calculated as the average of the rates
on open GICs held in the Fund, weighted in proportion to the amounts allocated to each such GIC. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. In September, 1991, the Committee began discussing the possibility of expanding investment options under the
Plan in order to give participants greater flexibility and diversity of choice among investments with respect to
appropriate levels of risk and return. On April 16, 1992, the Committee resolved to offer four investment options,
effective as of July 1, 1992. These were to be the GIC Fund, the Fidelity Equity Income Fund and two additional options,
the Fidelity Growth and Income Fund and the Value Line U.S. Government Securities Fund. Participants were informed
of the additional options by notice from the Committee on May 26, 1992. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
5. The Committee subsequently received and processed directions from participants for changes in investments as
of the July 1, 1992 change date. The new investment directions required the transfer of $258,572 held in the GIC Fund,
or approximately 10% of Plan assets, to other investment options. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
6. Because of restrictions under the GICs, however, the Plan was unable to redeem its interest in the contracts to effect
the transfer of amounts to other investments as directed by participants. Specifically, under the Principal Group
GIC, Principal could terminate the contract if withdrawals were made prior to the maturity date. H&amp;V understood
that similar restrictions applied under the other GICs held in the GIC Fund (although in fact there were no comparable
restrictions on the Vanguard GICs). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
7. To enable participants whose Accounts were invested in the GIC Fund to make use of the new investment options and
to protect participants from incurring penalties for premature withdrawals from the GICs, the Committee resolved
to advance funds to the Plan. On August 26, 1992, $188,000 was wire transferred by H&amp;V to the Plan. The $188,000
was invested in equity funds in accordance with the directions of those participants whose account balances in the
GIC Fund could not otherwise be transferred.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
8. Subsequent to the advance of funds, H&amp;V was advised that the transaction might constitute a prohibited transaction
under section 406 of the Act and section 4975 of the Code. H&amp;V therefore took immediate action in an attempt to put
the Plan in the position in which it would have been had the transaction not occurred. The Committee determined that
under the Vanguard GICs, funds could be transferred at that time without penalties to participants. Allocations
to the GIC Fund made by participants in September and October, 1992 were applied, together with a partial liquidation
principally of the Vanguard Fixed Rate Trust II&hyph;91, to repay to H&amp;V the amount that had been advanced to the
Plan. Specifically, $163,548 was repaid to H&amp;V on November 10, 1992, and $24,452 was retained by the Plan and used
as an offset for contributions which would have otherwise been made by H&amp;V. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
9. Under the terms of the Plan, the amounts repaid to H&amp;V would have been invested in the open GICs held in the GIC
Fund, had the Loan not been made. The money that was in the GIC Fund prior to the Loan remained in the GIC Fund because it
could not be transferred out without penalty. Thus, the subsequent allocations could be used to repay the Loan to H&amp;V,
and the GIC Fund remained in the same position it would have been in had the Loan by H&amp;V not been made. The entire effect
of the Loan and repayment to H&amp;V was thus to provide liquidity to the GIC Fund in order to make transfers to other
investment funds as directed by participants. The transaction was corrected within 90 days. No interest or other
expense was paid by the Plan. Participants who did not transfer amounts from the GIC Fund as of the July 1, 1992 change
date continued to receive the same return on their investment in the Fund. Participants who later invested in the GIC
Fund received the same return they would have received if the subject transaction had not occurred. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
10. In summary, the applicant represents that the subject transaction satisfied the criteria contained in section
408(a) of the Act for the following reasons: (a) The Loan enabled the Plan to effect the transfer of amounts held in participant
Accounts without penalty to new investments made available under the Plan; (b) Accounts transferred from the GIC
Fund were credited with amounts representing the allocable principal deposit in the fund plus accrued interest at
the Fund rate; (c) Accounts which remained invested in the GIC Fund continued to receive interest at the same rate;
(d) no interest or other expense was incurred by the Plan with respect to the Loan; (e) the applicant undid the Loan as
soon as it realized that the Loan constituted a prohibited transaction, with repayment of the loan taking place within
90 days of the making of the Loan; and (f) repayment of the loan was restricted to amounts held in or allocated to the GIC
Fund, and no other Plan assets were used for that purpose.

2. The Plan was formerly sponsored by Western Capital Investment Corporation (WCIC) of Denver, Colorado and its affiliated
companies. WCIC was a unitary savings and loan holding company whose primary asset was the sole ownership of Bank Western.
On December 18, 1992, WCIC was merged into CNB, a wholly owned subsidiary of First Bank System, Inc. (First Bank System)
of Minneapolis, Minnesota. As a result of the merger, the employees of Bank Western currently participate in the First
Bank System employee benefit plans, including its retirement plans. It is anticipated that when First Bank System
receives a favorable determination letter with respect to amendments to the Plan, it will be merged into the First
Bank System 401(k) Plan.

The Plan acquired its first Mobile Home Loan from Shelter America Corporation (SAC), a party in interest, on April
25, 1985. The acquisition price paid by the Plan was $11,067. This amount reflected the outstanding principal balance
of the loan. The borrowers, Andrew and Katherine Lorenzo, were not parties in interest. When purchased by the Plan,
the Lorenzo Mobile Home Loan carried an interest rate of 13 percent per annum and a maturity of 144 months. The collateral
for the Lorenzo Mobile Home Loan was a first lien on a 1977 Liberty, Liberator 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(14&times;60 foot) mobile home. No restrictions were placed on the sale or transfer of this loan. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Plan acquired its second Mobile Home Loan from SAC on July 8, 1986 for $17,960, which represented the outstanding
principal balance of such loan. The borrowers, James and Lauretta Gruber, were unrelated parties. At the time of purchase
by the Plan, the Gruber Mobile Home Loan had an outstanding balance of $17,960 and bore interest at the coupon rate of

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
12.95 percent. The loan had a maturity of 180 months and was secured by a first lien interest on a Central Homes (26&times;44
foot) double-wide mobile home. The Plan could sell or transfer this loan without any restrictions.

The applicant states that no documentation exists which would define the investment criteria used by the Plan's Trustees
in selecting the Mobile Home Loans as Plan investments. The applicant represents that at the time these investments
were made, both Bank Western and SAC were actively investing in mobile home loans such that the Trustees thought these
loans would be sound investments for the Plan due to their high rates of return. Accordingly, the Department notes
that the decisions by the Trustees to have the Plan acquire and hold the Mobile Home Loans are governed by the fiduciary
responsibility requirements of part 4, Subtitle B, Title I of the Act. In this regard, the Department is not proposing,
nor is the applicant requesting exemptive relief for any violations of part 4 which may have arisen as a result of the
Plan's acquisition and holding of the Mobile Home Loans (see Representation 7).

The applicant notes that while the Plan held the Mobile Home Loans, the Lorenzos and the Grubers were occasionally
delinquent. However, the applicant explains that, in all instances, the borrowers quickly corrected these delinquencies
and the loans were current at the time of the sale transaction described herein.

The Plan received total investment income of $14,423 in connection with its investment in the Mobile Home Loans. The
Plan also paid servicing fees to SAC with respect to the administration of the Mobile Home Loans. Such servicing fees
were based on the receipt of a flat 11 percent interest rate. Income received above that rate was retained by SAC. Through
December 31, 1988, the Plan recorded servicing fees of $1,571. Following this date, the reporting system was changed
and the only entries that appeared were recordings of net interest income received by the Plan. No other fees were paid
by the Plan in connection with this investment.

involves the purchase of the loan with all of the underlying benefits and risks. The applicant explains that the purchaser
receives all principal and interest payments as the borrower makes the payments. The applicant further explains
that a Whole Loan is not part of a larger pool of loans nor does it contain special guarantees as do GNMA investments.

employees of WCIC and its related companies. The Plan then became a section 401(k) cash or deferred compensation plan
effective January 1, 1991. In the process of converting the Plan, the Trustees determined that they should seek outside
investment expertise and provide participants with a choice of investment vehicles. Therefore, in October 1990,
the Trustees selected Brinson Partners, Inc. (Brinson) of Chicago, Illinois to manage the alternative investment
vehicles to be offered to participants. In addition, an existing block of WCIC stock was delivered to Brinson to dispose
of at its discretion.

 Other than the WCIC stock, the goal of the Trustees was to liquidate all of the Plan's other assets and to deliver cash

From October 1990 through the end of 1990, the Trustees proceeded to liquidate the Plan's investments. The bulk of
the liquidations took place in December 1990. However, certain of the Plan's assets, including the subject Assets,
were difficult to sell, primarily due to their small investment size and high servicing costs. Therefore, the Trustees
believed their only alternative was to sell the Assets to Bank Western. Thus, the trades were arranged on December
27, 1990. The Plan paid no fees or commissions to Bank Western in connection with the sale. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
5. The following Asset Summary Table reflects, in pertinent part, the status of the Assets at the time of the December
1990 sale. In addition, the table shows the Asset sales that have been exempted by the Department and discussed further
herein in Representation 7. Presented below are descriptions of the Assets as summarized in the table.

a. The GNMA Pools
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
As the Asset Summary Table shows, the Plan received $685,418 in income with respect to its investment of $2,537,594
in the GNMA Pools as well as a return of principal of $1,090,061. At the time of the December sale, the GNMA Pools had an
outstanding principal balance of $1,447,533. Bank Western paid the Plan $1,459,094. Thus, the gross return to the
Plan with respect to the GNMA Pools was $3,234,573 and the net gain realized for this investment was $696,979. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In valuing the GNMA Pools, it is represented that the Trustees obtained estimated fair market prices by telephone
from several unrelated appraisers. However, the applicant states that none of these dealers was willing to buy the
securities at the prices quoted to due to their small aggregate balance. Bank Western ultimately purchased the interests
held by the Plan in GNMA Pools A, C and D for a total cash acquisition price of $1,409,709 based upon market quotations
that were obtained by the Trustees on December 27, 1990 from an unrelated source, ``Bloomberg Financial Markets,
Commodity News'' (the Bloomberg System).

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Plan's investment in GNMA Pool B was valued at $49,385 on or about December 20, 1990 by the Denver, Colorado office
of Prudential Securities, Inc. (formerly, Prudential-Bache Securities, Inc.), another unrelated appraiser.

According to the applicant, the Bloomberg System is a national information and pricing data-based system which provides
current market analysis and pricing information on most financial markets and instruments, including GNMA Pools.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
b. The CMO
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As of December 1990, the Plan had received interest income of $7,688 with respect to its $75,000 investment in the CMO
as well as a return of principal of $48,428. Also as of December 1990, the CMO had a remaining balance plus accrued interest
of $26,172. Thus, the gross return to the Plan with respect to this investment was $81,035. In addition, the Plan realized
a net gain of $6,035. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
According to the applicant, the Denver office of Merrill Lynch, an unrelated party, determined that, as of December
19, 1990, the CMO would trade for 93 percent of its outstanding balance and it attempted to sell the CMO for that price
but to no avail. Therefore, Bank Western purchased the asset for 93.6875 percent of its par value of $26,172 or $24,519.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
c. The Mobile Home Loans
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As of December 28, 1990, the Plan had received $14,423 in income with respect to its $29,027 investment in the two Mobile
Home Loans and a return of principal of $4,428. The Plan also had paid total servicing fees of $1,571 with respect to
such investment. At the time of the December sale, the Mobile Home Loans had an outstanding principal balance of $24,599
and Bank Western paid the Plan a total sales price of $23,143. Thus, the Plan received a gross return of $40,423 for this
investment and it realized a net gain of $11,396. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
According to the applicant, there was no independent appraisal of the Mobile Home Loans in order to determine their
fair market value. Instead, SAC, Bank Western's affiliate, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
calculated the fair market value of the Mobile Home Loans by discounting them to yield a market rate of return equal
to the current quoted rate for new mobile home loans. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
d. The Residential Mortgage Loans
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Of its investment of $1,003,958 in the Residential Mortgage Loans, the Plan received net income of $254,747 and a return
of principal of $497,032. The Plan also paid servicing fees totaling $11,090. On December 27, 1990, Bank Western paid
the Plan $488,497 for the Residential Mortgage Loans which had, at that time, an outstanding principal balance plus
accrued interest of $506,926. Thus, the Plan received a gross return of $1,240,276 with respect to this investment
and a net gain of $236,318.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
According to the applicant, the method for computing the sales price for the Residential Mortgage Loans required
that the Plan administrator obtain the current market yield for Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation (FHLMC) purchases
from Telerate, an independent information and pricing service regularly used by Bank Western in establishing quoted
rates for new loan obligations. The Plan administrator then obtained pricing information from the Financial Publishing
Company tables using a twelve year prepayment assumption. The price in the Financial Publishing tables resulted
from discounting the net yield on the loans at the required FHLMC whole loan market yield. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
e. The Whole Loans
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
With respect to the Whole Loans in which the Plan had made a total investment of $2,089,978, $1,488,791 represented
total income received and $122,290 represented the amount paid in servicing fees. The Plan also received a return
of principal of $1,559,696 for this investment. At the time of the December 1990 sale, the Whole Loans had an outstanding
principal balance plus accrued interest of $530,282. On the date of the sale, Bank Western paid the Plan $507,698 for
the Whole Loans. Thus, the gross return to the Plan with respect to the Whole Loans was $3,433,895 and the net gain realized
was $1,343,917. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
According to the applicant, the method established for calculating the selling price for the Whole Loans was similar
to that utilized to value the Residential Mortgage Loans except that due to the age of the Whole Loans, current market
yields were not used. Therefore, the Plan administrator valued the Whole Loans by referring to the yield on GNMA 9.5
percent securities as reported in the Wall Street Journal because such securities were believed to be representative
of the age of the loans in these pools. The Plan administrator then discounted the net yield on the Whole Loans and determined
the price for the Whole Loans from the Financial Publishing Company tables. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
6. Upon realizing that the aforementioned transactions were prohibited transactions in violation of the Act, Bank
Western offered to sell all of the Assets back to the Plan. However, the Trustees determined that because of the limited
liquidity of the Assets and their investment performance, the Plan would only repurchase those Assets which it could
sell at a higher price than that paid by Bank Western. Consequently, the Plan repurchased GNMA Pool C for $965,181,
which was the same price that Bank Western had paid.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
10
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 This Asset was subsequently sold by the Trustees to an unrelated party for $996,154. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

</FOOTNAME>
<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->
The applicant represents that the repurchase by the Plan of its interest in GNMA Pool C from Bank Western constitutes
``correction'' within the meaning of section 4941 of the Code. Whether the subject repurchase by the Plan represents
actual correction of the prior prohibited transaction is a determination that is within the jurisdiction of the Service.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
7. CNB, as successor in interest to Bank Western, requests an administrative exemption from the Department with respect
to Bank Western's past purchase from the Plan of interests in the GNMA Pools, the CMO, the Residential Mortgage Loans
and the Whole Loans for an aggregate cost of $2,479,808 as shown in the Asset Summary Table. CNB acknowledges that the
(a) the Plan's acquisition of the Mobile Home Loans which were obtained from SAC, (b) the servicing of the Mobile Home
Loans by SAC for a fee, and (c) the subsequent sale of the Mobile Home Loans by the Plan to Bank Western resulted in prohibited
transactions in violation of the Act. Therefore, CNB is not requesting exemptive relief with respect to any transactions
involving the Mobile Home Loans nor is the Department granting exemptive relief with respect to such loans. To the
extent the resale by Bank Western of its interest in GNMA Pool C constituted a correction within the meaning of the Code,
CNB is not requesting exemptive relief. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
8. Bank Western represents that on October 28, 1992, it filed a Form 5330 with the Service and it paid total excise taxes
of $126,776 that were assessed on the Assets it acquired from the Plan. CNB, as successor in interest to Bank Western,
states that it will pay any additional excise taxes that may be owed to the Service within 90 days of the publication
in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 of the notice granting the exemptive relief herein. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
9. In summary, it is represented that the transaction satisfies the statutory criteria for an exemption under 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
section 408(a) of the Act because: (a) The sale represented a one-time transaction for cash; (b) the sales price for
each Asset was based upon its fair market value as determined by a qualified, independent appraisal; (c) the Plan did
not pay any fees or commissions in connection with the sale; and (d) CNB will file a Form 5330 with the Service and pay
any applicable excise taxes that may be due on any of the Assets within 90 days of the publication in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Department is considering granting an exemption under the authority of section 408(a) of the Act and in accordance
with the procedures set forth in 29 CFR Part 2570, Subpart B (55 FR 32836, 32847, August 10, 1990). If the exemption is
granted, the restrictions of section 406(b)(2) of the Act shall not apply to the proposed cross-trading of equity
securities between various accounts managed by BFM (the Accounts) where at least one Account involved in any cross-trade
is an employee benefit plan account (Plan Account) for which BFM acts as a fiduciary. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
Conditions and Definitions 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This proposed exemption is subject to the following conditions: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. (a) Each Plan Account's participation in the cross-trade program is subject to BFM's receipt of a written authorization
executed in advance by a qualified Plan fiduciary, which is independent of BFM and its Affiliates (the Independent
Fiduciary). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) The authorization referred to in paragraph (a) is terminable at will, without penalty to the Plan Account, upon
receipt by BFM of written notice of termination. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) Before an authorization is made for any Account, an independent account representative, which must be an Independent
Fiduciary in the case of a Plan Account (collectively, an Independent Account Representative) must be furnished
with any reasonable available information necessary for the Independent Account Representative to determine whether
the authorization should be made, including (but not limited to) a copy of the proposed and final exemption, an explanation
of how the authorization may be terminated, a description of BFM's cross-trade practices, and any other information
requested by the Independent Account Representative. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. Each cross-trade transaction must satisfy the following: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(a) The cross-trade opportunity must be triggered as a result of an Account participating in the program experiencing
a need to sell equity securities arising from one of the following three circumstances: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) the Independent Account Representative specifically directs that all of the assets in the Account be liquidated;

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) the Independent Account Representative specifically directs that a portion of the Account be liquidated and
the selection of the particular equity securities to be sold is made either by the Independent Account Representative
or by an optimization program used by BFM (the Optimization Program) which operates, pursuant to certain prescribed
objective criteria, to automatically generate an optimal portfolio for such Accounts; or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) the application of the Optimization Program to the specific investment objectives and restrictions established
by the Independent Account Representative requires the sale of a security which is otherwise ranked by BFM as a buy
or a hold for all relevant Accounts under the Stock Evaluation Process. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) With respect to each cross-trade opportunity triggered under paragraph 2(a), the Optimization Program used
by BFM must determine, in the ordinary course of its considering all available equity securities in the applicable
universe, that another Account or Accounts participating in the program should purchase some or all of the available
equity securities. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) The cross-trade transaction must take place within three business days of the ``triggering event'' giving rise
to the cross-trade opportunity described in paragraph 2(a) above. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(d) The cross-trade transaction must be effected through a broker which is unaffiliated with BFM and its Affiliates.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(e) The Independent Account Representative of each Account engaging in a cross-trade transaction must be provided
with a written confirmation of the cross-trade transaction within 10 days after the completion of the transaction.
The confirmation must set forth: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) The particular equity securities involved; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(iii) The price at which the transaction was executed; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iv) The specific triggering event, identified above in paragraph 2(a), which caused the cross-trade transaction
to occur. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. (a) Each cross-trade must be effected at the closing price for the equity securities involved on the date of the transaction,
as quoted by the exchange on which such securities are principally traded or by the NASDAQ National Market System (NASDAQ).
In the case of domestic equity securities traded over-the-counter, other than those traded on NASDAQ, the price must
be the mean between the closing daily ``bid'' and ``asked'' prices on the date of the transactions, obtained from recognized
independent sources, unless such securities have actually traded within 24 hours of the cross-trade transaction
in which case the price must be the last sale price for the securities. If more than one source is used by BFM to price a
particular domestic equity security traded over-the-counter, then the price must be equal to the average of the highest
current independent bid and lowest current independent offer obtained from such sources. No foreign equity securities,
other than those traded on a recognized foreign securities exchange for which market quotations are readily available,
shall be cross-traded by the Accounts. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) The equity securities involved in the cross-trade are those for which there is a generally recognized market with
adequate pricing information to enable BFM to use the Optimization Program for the Accounts in the transaction. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) The cross-trade must involve less than 5 percent of the aggregate average daily trading volume of the equity securities
which are the subject of the transaction for the week immediately preceding the completion of the transaction. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. For any cross-trade opportunity where equity securities available for sale from a Selling Account may be sold to
more than one Buying Account, each cross-trade opportunity shall be allocated first to the Buying Account which is
ranked by the Optimization Program as being furthest from optimality, measured on a numerical basis at the time of
the transaction, until such Account is brought up to par with the Account which is next furthest from optimality. Such
Accounts shall then be allocated cross-trade opportunities on a pro rata basis until the Accounts are brought up to
the level of the next Account which is furthest from optimality. This allocation process shall continue until all
cross-trade opportunities involving the equity securities in question are exhausted. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
5. (a) BFM furnishes the Independent Fiduciary for each Plan Account participating in the cross-trade program at
least once every three months, and not later than 45 days following the period to which it related, a report disclosing:

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) A list of all cross-trade transactions engaged in on behalf of the Plan Account during the period; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) With respect to each cross-trade transaction, the actual price used to effect the transaction and the identity
of the pricing source, as well as the highest and lowest reported prices at which the equity securities involved in
the transaction were traded on the date of such transaction. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) The authorizing Independent Fiduciary for each Plan Account participating in the program is furnished with a
summary report at least once per year. The summary must be furnished within 45 days after the end of the period to which
it relates, and must contain the following: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) A description of the total amount of the Plan Account's assets, by type of equity security, involved in cross-trade
transactions during the period; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) A description of BFM's cross-trade practices, if such practices have changed materially during the period covered
by the summary; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) A statement that the Independent Fiduciary's authorization of cross-trade transactions may be terminated
upon receipt by BFM of the Independent Fiduciary's written notice to that effect; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iv) A statement that the Independent Fiduciary's authorization of the Plan Account's participation in the cross-trade
program will continue in effect unless it is terminated.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
6. The cross-trade transaction does not involve assets of any employee benefit plan established or maintained by
BFM or any of its Affiliates (Batterymarch Plan).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
7. Each employee benefit plan comprising a Plan Account that participates in the cross-trading program must have
total assets equal to at least $25 million. In the case of multiple employee benefit plans maintained by a single employer
or controlled group of employers, the $25 million requirement may be met by aggregating the assets of such plans if
the assets are commingled for investment purposes in a single master trust.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
8. BFM receives no fee or other compensation (other than its agreed investment management fee) with respect to any
cross-trade transaction.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
9. BFM is a discretionary investment manager with respect to Plan Accounts participating in the cross-trade program
and does not cause any Plan Account to purchase or sell equity securities with another Account in order to merely track
or replicate the portfolio of an independently maintained third party index.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

Summary of Facts and Representations
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
1. BFM is a business trust organized under the laws of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts and registered as an investment
adviser pursuant to the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, as amended. BFM currently manages on a discretionary basis
approximately $7 billion in assets, of which approximately $4 billion consists of assets of Plan Accounts.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. BFM represents that there are certain circumstances when it is required to liquidate all or a portion of the equity
securities in an Account for which it acts as an investment manager. BFM proposes to cross-trade equity securities
between the Accounts in situations where the decision to sell equity securities from the Selling Account is made either
directly by the Independent Account Representative or by operation of a pre-established contractual obligation
established by the Independent Account Representative. In the case of a Plan Account, the Independent Account Representative
must be an authorized Independent Fiduciary. In all cross-trade situations, the decision as to the particular equity
securities to be sold at the time of the transaction will be made either by the Independent Account Representative
or by operation of the Optimization Program utilized by BFM. In the case of all Accounts, the Independent Account Representative
will be a person which is unrelated to BFM and its Affiliates. Cross-trade transactions will not involve assets of
any Batterymarch Plan.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. BFM states that a cross-trade opportunity, pursuant to the requested exemption, will arise only if the need to sell
equity securities from a Selling Account occurs as a result of one of the following ``trigger events''.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(a) The Independent Account Representative directs that all of the assets in the Account be liquidated. In such cases,
both the decision to sell equity securities from the Selling Account and the decision regarding the particular equity
securities to be sold will be made by the Independent Account Representative. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) The Independent Account Representative directs that a portion of the Account be liquidated. In such instances,
the decision to sell equity securities from the Selling Account will be made by the Independent Account Representative.
However, the determination of the particular equity securities to be sold by the Selling Account will be made either
by the Independent Account Representative or by the Optimization Program (as described below). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) The investment restrictions and objectives established by the Independent Account Representative for the Selling
Account require that a particular security or a particular type of security be sold. Whenever a choice must be made
as to particular equity securities to be sold, the Optimization Program will select the equity securities from the
Account's holdings in a manner calculated to best bring the Account into compliance with the applicable investment
restrictions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
BFM states that for all ``trigger events'' described above the selection of the specific equity securities to be sold
by the Selling Account through the operation of the Optimization Program will involve an automatic mechanical process,
pursuant to certain prescribed investment restrictions and objectives from an Independent Account Representative,
and will not involve any exercise of investment discretion by BFM. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
With respect to each potential cross-trade transaction, the Optimization Program will determine, in the ordinary
course of its considering all available equity securities in the applicable universe, that another Account or Accounts
participating in the program should purchase some or all of the available equity securities. In addition, each cross-trade
transaction will occur within three business days from the occurrence of the triggering event which establishes
the cross-trade opportunity. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. BFM represents that there are two fundamental components to its investment process_the Stock Evaluation Process
and the Portfolio Construction Process. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
With respect to the Stock Evaluation Process, BFM evaluates all of the equity securities in the applicable universe
by applying a variety of objective criteria and mathematical computations to rank the equity securities and characterize
each security with a ``buy'', a ``hold'', or a ``sell'' classification. BFM states that it does exercise some degree
of discretion in the Stock Evaluation Process portion of the investment process. For example, BFM selects the particular
strategic themes that are utilized from time to time in this process.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
11
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 However, BFM states that the Stock Evaluation Process and the strategic themes used at a particular time are applied
in exactly the same fashion for all Accounts which have directed BFM to invest in a particular universe of securities.
Thus, the exact same stock rankings and buy-hold-sell classifications are applied uniformly for each security in
every Account within such universe. The Stock Evaluation Process will never, in and of itself, give rise to direct
cross-trade opportunities because the results of the Stock Evaluation Process will be the same for every Account
in the particular universe. BFM states that it is only in the second part of the overall investment process (i.e. the
Portfolio Construction Process), when the specific investment objectives and restrictions which have been established
by the Independent Account Representative for the Account are overlaid against the results of the Stock Evaluation
Process, that differences appear for the various Accounts within a particular universe.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->
Some of the strategic themes which have been utilized by BFM include the following: (a) Acid Cash_stocks of companies
with high cash flow, measured by changes in corporate liquidity relative to market price; (b) Buybacks_stocks of
companies that have announced intentions of buying back a meaningful percentage of their own stock; (c) High Yield_stocks
of companies with above average yields relative to the overall market and within their own industries; (d) Low-Priced
Growth_stocks of companies with below average price-to-earnings ratios and above average growth; and (e) Insiders_stocks
of companies where corporate insiders have purchased the company's stock on the open market.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
With respect to the Portfolio Construction Process, BFM represents that the results of the Stock Evaluation Process
are brought together with the particular facts applicable to each Account to generate the optimal portfolio for that
Account and suggested trades to arrive at that optimal portfolio. The Portfolio Construction Process is driven by
the Optimization Program. The Optimization Program receives the relevant information and automatically generates
the optimal portfolio and the suggested buy and sell decisions that are designed to move a particular Account toward
``optimality'' (i.e. maximum expected return for a prescribed level of risk). The information utilized in the Portfolio
Construction Process consists of (i) the existing make-up of the portfolio of the particular Account, (ii) the investment
objectives and restrictions which have been established by the Independent Account Representative for the Account,
and (iii) objective economic data (such as existing market prices for equity securities, price-earnings ratios
for such securities, etc.) which is obtained by BFM from independent sources.

<!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
BFM represents that the results of its investment process will create cross-trade opportunities for the Accounts
under the following circumstances: (1) When the Independent Account Representative for an Account directs a liquidation
of all or a portion of the equity securities in the Account, as described in condition 2(a) (i) and (ii) above; or (2)
when the application of the Optimization Program in the Portfolio Construction Process requires the sale of a security
which is ranked as a ``buy'' or ``hold'' under the Stock Evaluation Process. In the latter instance, the sale of the
security results from the investment objectives and restrictions applicable to the Account which are established
by the Independent Account Representative, as described in condition 2(a)(iii) above. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For example, the applicable investment restrictions might provide that not more than 5 percent of the assets of the
Account can be invested in any one security. If a particular holding appreciates in value to a point where it exceeds
5 percent of the Account's assets, the excess shares must be sold by the Account to comply with this restriction even
though the stock is otherwise classified as a ``buy'' or ``hold'' under the Stock Evaluation Process. Alternatively,
the applicable investment restrictions might provide that not more than 10 percent of the assets of the Account can
be invested in equity securities of any one industry. If the aggregate value of all such equity securities in the Account
exceeds 10 percent of the Account's assets, the excess shares must be sold to comply with this restriction even though
the particular stock is otherwise classified as a ``buy'' or ``hold'' under the Stock Evaluation Process. In the latter
case, the Optimization Program would select the particular equity securities to be sold from the Account's holdings
in that industry so as to bring the Account into compliance with the applicable investment restriction and move the
Account toward ``optimality''. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
BFM represents that none of the Accounts in the proposed cross-trading program would be index funds that attempt to
track or replicate a particular independently maintained index, such as the Standard &amp; Poors 500 Index (the S&amp;P
500). Thus, under the proposed exemption, no Plan Account will purchase or sell equity securities with another Account
in order to merely track such an index. In all cases, BFM will exercise some degree of investment discretion to determine
which particular equity securities are desirable investments for the Accounts. As noted above, the rankings of each
security are developed as part of the Stock Evaluation Process and are identical for all Accounts invested in a particular
universe of equity securities. These rankings and the results of the Stock Evaluation Process will not be tied to any
particular index or to the specific investment objectives and restrictions established for the Account by its Independent
Account Representative. However, an index may be used as part of the investment objectives or restrictions established
by the Independent Account Representative, most typically as either a benchmark against which the Account's performance
is to be measured or a further restriction on the universe of securities available for an Account. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For example, an Account might be subject to an investment objective that seeks to outperform the S&amp;P 500 Index
to the maximum extent, subject to certain volatility parameters or risk tolerance levels specified by the Independent
Account Representative. In this situation, the foregoing investment objective would be taken into account by the
Optimization Program in determining the buys and sells for this Account which could lead to cross-trade opportunities.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
12
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Such an Account would be an actively managed account, not an index fund, even though the benchmark against which its
performance is measured would be an index.

The applicant has provided the following example: Assume there are two Accounts. Account A operates pursuant to a
relatively low risk investment objective, in terms of permitted deviation from the applicable benchmark, and Account
B uses the same benchmark but allows substantially greater risk in the hope of achieving better performance relative
to the benchmark over the long term. In this case, a particular stock which is viewed as attractive generally by BFM
and therefore is classified as a ``buy'' in the Stock Evaluation Process, might demonstrate an increased level of
volatility to the point that, as part of the Portfolio Construction Process, the Optimization Program may determine
that this stock should be sold by conservative Account A because its increased level of volatility is inconsistent
with the risk tolerance of Account A. Nevertheless, this particular stock might well continue to be attractive to
Account B given that Account's greater level of risk tolerance. The application of the investment objectives and
restrictions established for Account A would require that this stock, otherwise ranked as a ``buy'', be sold by Account
A which, in turn, would trigger a direct cross-trade opportunity pursuant to which Account B would be able to acquire
the stock directly from Account A. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
</FOOTNOTE>

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As a further example, an Account might be established which is subject to an investment restriction providing that
the Account may be invested only in equity securities which constitute the 100 largest equity securities (by market
capitalization) in the S&amp;P 500 Index. This investment restriction will be incorporated by the Optimization
Program as part of the Portfolio Construction Process for the Account, taking into account the uniform rankings developed
by BFM for all of the equity securities in the particular universe. If a security ceases to be one of the 100 largest equity
securities in the S&amp;P 500 Index, it would no longer be eligible to be held by the Account and would have to be sold.
This would be a trigger event that would give rise to a direct cross-trade opportunity whereby other Accounts which
are not so limited would be able to purchase this security from the Selling Account, assuming that the Optimization
Program indicates that such a purchase would be desirable for those Accounts in order to move toward ``optimality''.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
5. The Optimization Program is a computer program developed by an independent third party and utilized by BFM pursuant
to a license agreement. Various such programs are commercially available. BFM represents that the ability to exercise
discretion for the operation of the Optimization Program is limited. BFM selects the Optimization Program, selects
and weighs the strategic themes used at any point in time in the Stock Evaluation Process, and develops certain mathematical
models used as data for the Optimization Program. Once installed, the Optimization Program typically remains in
place without material change for a lengthy period of time (2 to 10 years). While the strategic themes and mathematical
models are changed more frequently, they usually remain unchanged for approximately 12 months. BFM states that the
Optimization Program operates in an automatic fashion and that actions within BFM's discretionary control (e.g.
changing its strategic themes or changing the mathematical models used in its stock rankings for the Stock Evaluation
Process) will not generate direct cross-trade transactions.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
6. BFM uses the Optimization Program on a daily basis to examine all equity securities in the applicable universe and
to determine the specific equity securities, if any, to be purchased for each Account in order to achieve the optimal
portfolio for that Account. Each universe is developed by BFM as part of the Stock Evaluation Process and is uniform
for all Accounts for which that particular universe is relevant.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For example, in the context of domestic equity securities, BFM determines the universe of securities to be considered
for potential investment as part of the Stock Evaluation Process. The universe for domestic equity clients currently
consists of all U.S. publicly-traded common stocks, excluding any such stock which has a market capitalization of
less than $50 million. BFM states that this domestic equity securities universe, which includes several thousand
stocks, is identical for all of BFM's domestic equity Accounts unless certain restrictions are imposed by the Independent
Account Representative.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition to domestic equity Accounts, BFM uses the Optimization Program to examine data on foreign equity securities
for Accounts that have designated investment objectives which permit such securities for their portfolios. At the
present time, the potential universe of securities for such Accounts would include equity securities listed on exchanges
in the following countries: Australia; Austria; Belgium; Canada; Denmark; Finland; France; Germany; Hong Kong;
Ireland; Italy; Japan; Malaysia; Mexico; Netherlands; New Zealand; Norway; Singapore; Spain; Sweden; Switzerland;
and the United Kingdom. BFM states that these are the countries which today have sufficiently developed securities
markets (including adequate data on the exchange-traded securities) to permit use of the Optimization Program for
the Accounts. BFM represents that the two-part investment process (i.e. the Stock Evaluation Process and the Portfolio
Construction Process) operates in substantially the same manner for foreign equity securities as it does for domestic
equity securities. In all cases involving either domestic or foreign equity securities, the Independent Account
Representative for each Account will determine which universe is relevant for the Account.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
To the extent there are any equity securities available for sale from a Selling Account by reason of one of the triggering
events, the Optimization Program will include the equity securities in its analysis of all available equity securities
in a particular universe, taking into account the lower transaction costs available for cross-trade transactions
involving such securities. However, BFM states that the opportunity for a cross-trade will not influence the Optimization
Program's analysis and determination as to whether such securities should be bought or sold for an Account except
to the extent transaction costs are lower.

<!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In the event any of the equity securities available for sale in cross-trade transactions are attractive to more than
one Account, the Optimization Program will automatically allocate such securities among the Accounts on a consistent,
objective basis according to the allocation methodology described herein (see Item 14 below). The allocation methodology
will be disclosed to, and approved by, the Independent Account Representatives. Since the determination and allocation
of cross-trade opportunities among potential Buying Accounts will be performed automatically by the Optimization
Program, BFM states that it will be unable to use any discretion to benefit one Account over another Account.

7. BFM represents that since particular equity securities which are sold by a Selling Account in one of the ``trigger
events'' described above are often desirable investments (i.e. classified as a ``buy'' or a ``hold'' under the Stock
Evaluation Process) for BFM's other Accounts, the opportunity to cross-trade such securities would significantly
reduce the transaction costs incurred by both the Selling Accounts and the Buying Accounts. BFM states that these
savings result from the fact that the independent broker effecting a cross-trade transaction will effect the transaction
for a lower commission. The independent broker will effect these transactions for approximately .5
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=7 f=2 -->
&cent;
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 per share. By contrast, if BFM were to effect the same trade other than by a cross-trade transaction, the commission
would be approximately 2&cent; per share. In the context of foreign equity securities, where brokerage commissions
are significantly higher, the potential savings on commissions would be even greater. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
BFM states that cross-trading also avoids the bid/ask differential that would ordinarily occur in such transactions
because the price received by the Selling Account for a particular equity security will be the same price paid by the
Buying Account. The elimination of any price differential in equity securities that are cross-traded will result
in savings of approximately 1&cent; per share for each Account. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition, the ability to use cross-trade transactions to shift equity securities directly from a Selling Account
to a Buying Account will enable BFM to implement optimal investment strategies for the Accounts more effectively.
First, the allocation of equity securities necessary to bring Accounts closer to optimality would be easier because
all ``buys'' will be net position buys for the Accounts without any bid/offer spread. Second, there is a timing efficiency
to be achieved if direct cross-trades are permitted. Under BFM's current procedures, if an Account has sold a particular
security on a particular day, no other Account is permitted to buy that security on that day. Rather, all purchases
of such security are deferred until the next day. Similarly, if an Account has bought a particular security on a given
day, other Accounts are not permitted to sell that security on the same day. Under the requested exemption, BFM would
be able to net these contemporaneous buy and sell orders on the same day.

<!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Finally, the ability to effect direct cross-trades will avoid the adverse consequences of any market impact which
trading in particular equity securities may generate. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
8. BFM represents that each employee benefit plan comprising a Plan Account that participates in the cross-trading
program must have total assets equal to at least $25 million. In the case of multiple employee benefit plans maintained
by a single employer or controlled group of employers, the $25 million requirement may be met by aggregating the assets
of such plans if the assets are commingled for investment purposes in a single master trust. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
9. The Independent Fiduciary will provide written authorization before a Plan Account is permitted to participate
in BFM's cross-trade program. This authorization will be terminable at will upon written notice by the Independent
Fiduciary. BFM will receive no additional fee or other compensation for providing such cross-trading services.
No penalty or other charge will be made as a result of the termination of an Account's participation in the cross-trade
program. Before any authorization is made by a Plan Account, BFM will provide the Independent Fiduciary for the Plan
Account with all reasonably available materials necessary to permit an evaluation of the cross-trade program by
such fiduciary. These materials will include a copy of the proposed and final exemption, an explanation of how the
Plan Account's authorization may be terminated, a description of BFM's cross-trade practices, and any other reasonably
available information requested by the Independent Fiduciary. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
10. The Independent Account Representative of each Account engaging in a cross-trade transaction will be provided
with a written confirmation of the cross-trade transaction within 10 days after the transaction is completed. The
confirmation will set forth information regarding the particular equity securities involved, the number of shares
involved, the price at which the transaction was executed, and the specific ``trigger event'' (identified in condition
2(a) above) which caused the cross-trade transaction to occur. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
11. BFM will provide the Independent Fiduciary of each Plan Account participating in the cross-trade program with
a report, at least once every three months and not later than 45 days following the period for the report, setting forth:
(a) A list of all cross-trade transactions engaged in on behalf of the Plan Account during the previous period; and
(b) with respect to each cross-trade transaction, the actual price used to effect the transaction and the identity
of the pricing source, as well as the highest and lowest reported prices at which the subject equity securities were
traded on the date of such transaction. In addition, the Independent Fiduciary of each Plan Account participating
in the cross-trade program will be provided with a summary report at least once a year, and not later than 45 days after
the end of the period for the report, which will include: (a) A description of the total amount of Plan Account assets,
by type of equity security, involved in cross-trade transactions completed during the year; (b) a statement that
the Independent Fiduciary's authorization for the Plan Account to participate in the cross-trade program can be
terminated without penalty upon BFM's receipt of a written notice to that effect; (c) a statement that the Independent
Fiduciary's authorization regarding the cross-trade program will continue unless it is terminated; and (d) a description
of any material change in BFM's cross-trade practices during the period covered by the summary report. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
BFM states that these reports will provide the Independent Fiduciary with a mechanism for monitoring the operation
of the cross-trade program. BFM represents that the authorization procedures and the limited circumstances in which
cross-trade transactions will be considered, in conjunction with BFM's use of the Optimization Program, will prevent
BFM from favoring one Account at the expense of another Account in a cross-trade transaction. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
12. The equity securities involved in any cross-trade transaction will be only those for which there is a generally
recognized market with adequate pricing information to permit use of the Optimization Program for the Accounts.
All cross-trades will be effected at prices determined according to an established, fixed methodology which will
be applied uniformly to all Accounts. Under this pricing methodology, each cross-trade transaction will be effected
at the closing price for the equity securities involved on the date of the transaction, as quoted by the exchange on
which such securities are principally traded or by the NASDAQ National Market System (NASDAQ). In the case of domestic
equity securities traded over-the-counter, other than those traded on NASDAQ, the price will be the mean between
the closing daily ``bid'' and ``asked'' prices on the date of the transactions, obtained from recognized independent
sources, unless such securities have actually traded within 24 hours of the cross-trade transaction in which case
the price will be the last sale price for the securities. However, if more than one source is used by BFM to price a particular
domestic equity security traded over-the-counter, then the price will be equal to the average of the highest current
independent bid and lowest current independent offer obtained from such sources. BFM states that no foreign equity
securities, other than those traded on a recognized foreign securities exchange for which market quotations are
readily available, will be cross-traded by the Accounts. The pricing methodology will be communicated to the Independent
Account Representative at the beginning of the Account's participation in the cross-trade program. The pricing
methodology will apply to all cross-trade transactions implemented by BFM under the proposed exemption. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
BFM states that utilization of an established, fixed pricing methodology will prevent it from being able to use any
discretion to manipulate cross-trades to benefit one Account over another Account. Moreover, BFM will in all cases
utilize price data obtained from an independent pricing source.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
13. A cross-trade transaction will be effected only where the trade involves less than 5 percent of the aggregate average
daily trading volume for the equity securities which are the subject of the transaction for the week immediately preceding
the completion of the transaction. BFM states that this percentage limitation attempts to address the potential
impact which a large trade might have in the sale of equity securities on the open market. Thus, BFM will only engage
in cross-trade transactions where the size of the trade will ensure that the price utilized in the cross-trade will
not differ materially from what would have been the market price for the equity securities in an open market transaction.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
14. BFM represents that where equity securities available for sale from a Selling Account present an attractive investment
opportunity for more than one Buying Account, BFM will make the allocation to that Buying Account which is ranked by
the Optimization Program as being furthest from optimality.
<FOOTCITE>13</FOOTCITE>
 BFM states that each Account's distance from optimality can be measured and quantified on a numerical basis at any
point in time. Cross-trade opportunities would continue to be allocated to such a Buying Account until it is brought
up to par with the Account which is next furthest from optimality. Thereafter, the cross-trade opportunities would
be allocated to both of these Accounts pro rata until they are brought up to the level of the Account which is next furthest
from optimality, and so on until all cross-trading opportunities involving the equity securities in question are
exhausted. BFM states that this allocation process will operate in a mechanical, objective fashion and will not be
manipulated in any way by BFM to benefit particular Accounts during the operation of the cross-trading program.

The Department is not proposing, nor is the applicant requesting, exemptive relief for any violations of Part 4 of
Title I of the Act which may arise from BFM's allocation of investment opportunities to particular Buying Accounts
under the proposed cross-trading program. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
</FOOTNOTE>

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
15. In summary, the applicant represents that the proposed transactions will satisfy the criteria of section 408(a)
of the Act because, among other things: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(a) An Independent Fiduciary must provide written authorization, which is terminable at will, to BFM to permit the
Account to participate in the cross-trading program; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) All cross-trade transactions will be effected within three business days of the triggering event creating the
cross-trade opportunity; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) All cross-trade transactions will be effected at a price determined pursuant to a established, fixed methodology
using independent pricing sources and will be applied uniformly to all Accounts; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(d) All cross-trade opportunities will be subject to an allocation methodology which is designed to benefit Accounts
which are ranked by the Optimization Program as being furthest from optimality and will not be manipulated by BFM to
benefit particular Accounts;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(e) A cross-trade transaction will be effected only if certain volume requirements are satisfied; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(f) All equity securities (i.e. either foreign or domestic) involved in cross-trade transactions will be securities
for which there is a generally recognized market; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(g) BFM will receive no additional fees as a result of the proposed cross-trade transactions; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(h) BFM will provide periodic reporting of the cross-trade transactions to the Independent Fiduciaries of the participating
Plan Accounts; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) The opportunity to participate in the cross-trade program will save significant sums of money for the Accounts
because cross-trading reduces brokerage commissions, avoids the bid/ask differential in such transactions, and
provides more efficient implementation of optimal investment strategies; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(j) Each employee benefit plan comprising a Plan Account which participates in the cross-trading program must have
total assets of at least $25 million, or must be part of a master trust of plans maintained by a single employer or controlled
group of employers which has at least $25 million in total assets; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(k) The cross-trade transactions will not involve the assets of any Batterymarch Plan.

General Information 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The attention of interested persons is directed to the following: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) The fact that a transaction is the subject of an exemption under section 408(a) of the Act and/or section 4975(c)(2)
of the Code does not relieve a fiduciary or other party in interest of disqualified person from certain other provisions
of the Act and/or the Code, including any prohibited transaction provisions to which the exemption does not apply
and the general fiduciary responsibility provisions of section 404 of the Act, which among other things require a
fiduciary to discharge his duties respecting the plan solely in the interest of the participants and beneficiaries
of the plan and in a prudent fashion in accordance with section 404(a)(1)(b) of the act; nor does it affect the requirement
of section 401(a) of the Code that the plan must operate for the exclusive benefit of the employees of the employer maintaining
the plan and their beneficiaries; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Before an exemption may be granted under section 408(a) of the Act and/or section 4975(c)(2) of the Code, the Department
must find that the exemption is administratively feasible, in the interests of the plan and of its participants and
beneficiaries and protective of the rights of participants and beneficiaries of the plan;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) The proposed exemptions, if granted, will be supplemental to, and not in derogation of, any other provisions of
the Act and/or the Code, including statutory or administrative exemptions and transitional rules. Furthermore,
the fact that a transaction is subject to an administrative or statutory exemption is not dispositive of whether the
transaction is in fact a prohibited transaction; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) The proposed exemptions, if granted, will be subject to the express condition that the material facts and representations
contained in each application are true and complete and accurately describe all material terms of the transaction
which is the subject of the exemption. In the case of continuing exemption transactions, if any of the material facts
or representations described in the application change after the exemption is granted, the exemption will cease
to apply as of the date of such change. In the event of any such change, application for a new exemption may be made to the
Department.

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 This document contains exemptions issued by the Department of Labor (the Department) from certain of the prohibited
transaction restrictions of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (the Act) and/or the Internal Revenue
Code of 1986 (the Code).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Notices were published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
of the pendency before the Department of proposals to grant such exemptions. The notices set forth a summary of facts
and representations contained in each application for exemption and referred interested persons to the respective
applications for a complete statement of the facts and representations. The applications have been available for
public inspection at the Department in Washington, DC. The notices also invited interested persons to submit comments
on the requested exemptions to the Department. In addition the notices stated that any interested person might submit
a written request that a public hearing be held (where appropriate). The applicants have represented that they have
complied with the requirements of the notification to interested persons. No public comments and no requests for
a hearing, unless otherwise stated, were received by the Department.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The notices of proposed exemption were issued and the exemptions are being granted solely by the Department because,
effective December 31, 1978, section 102 of Reorganization Plan No. 4 of 1978 (43 FR 47713, October 17, 1978) transferred
the authority of the Secretary of the Treasury to issue exemptions of the type proposed to the Secretary of Labor.

The attention of interested persons is directed to the following:

(1) The fact that a transaction is the subject of an exemption under section 408(a) of the Act 
<!-- PJG 0034 unknown -->
&blank;&blank;and/or section 4975(c)(2) of the Code does not relieve a fiduciary or other party in interest or disqualified
person from certain other provisions to which the exemptions does not apply and the general fiduciary responsibility
provisions of section 404 of the Act, which among other things require a fiduciary to discharge his duties respecting

is subject to an administrative or statutory exemption is not dispositive of whether the transaction is in fact a prohibited
transaction; and
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) The availability of these exemptions is subject to the express condition that the material facts and representations
contained in each application are true and complete and accurately describe all material terms of the transaction
which is the subject of the exemption. In the case of continuing exemption transactions, if any of the material facts
or representations described in the application change after the exemption is granted, the exemption will cease
to apply as of the date of such change. In the event of any such change, application for a new exemption may be made to the
Department.

I. Background 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Pursuant to Public Law 97&hyph;415, the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(the Commission or NRC staff) is publishing this regular biweekly notice. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Public Law 97&hyph;415 revised section 189 of the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
amended (the Act), to require the Commission to publish notice of any 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
amendments issued, or proposed to be issued, under a new provision of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
section 189 of the Act. This provision grants the Commission the authority 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to issue and make immediately effective any amendment to an operating 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
license upon a determination by the Commission that such amendment involves 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
no significant hazards consideration, notwithstanding the pendency before 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the Commission of a request for a hearing from any person. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This biweekly notice includes all notices of amendments issued, or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proposed to be issued from May 2, 1994, through May 13, 1994. The last 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
biweekly notice was published on May 12, 1994 (59 FR 24745). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=85 g=1 f=1 -->
Notice of Consideration of Issuance of Amendments to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Facility Operating Licenses, Proposed No Significant Hazards 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Consideration Determination, and Opportunity for a Hearing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Commission has made a proposed determination that the following 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
amendment requests involve no significant hazards consideration. Under the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Commission's regulations in 10 CFR 50.92, this means that operation of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
facility in accordance with the proposed amendment would not (1) involve a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
previously evaluated; or (2) create the possibility of a new or different 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated; or (3) involve a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
significant reduction in a margin of safety. The basis for this proposed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
determination for each amendment request is shown below. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Commission is seeking public comments on this proposed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
determination. Any comments received within 30 days after the date of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
publication of this notice will be considered in making any final 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
determination. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Normally, the Commission will not issue the amendment until the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
expiration of the 30-day notice period. However, should circumstances 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
change during the notice period such that failure to act in a timely way 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
would result, for example, in derating or shutdown of the facility, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Commission may issue the license amendment before the expiration of the 30-
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
day notice period, provided that its final determination is that the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
amendment involves no significant hazards consideration. The final 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
determination will consider all public and State comments received before 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
action is taken. Should the Commission take this action, it will publish 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 a notice of issuance and provide for opportunity 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for a hearing after issuance. The Commission expects that the need to take 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
this action will occur very infrequently. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Written comments may be submitted by mail to the Rules Review and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Directives Branch, Division of Freedom of Information and Publications 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

 notice. Written comments may also be delivered to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Room 6D22, Two White Flint North, 11555 Rockville Pike, Rockville, Maryland 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
from 7:30 a.m. to 4:15 p.m. Federal workdays. Copies of written comments 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
received may be examined at the NRC Public Document Room, the Gelman 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Building, 2120 L Street, NW., Washington, DC 20555. The filing of requests 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for a hearing and petitions for leave to intervene is discussed below. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
By June 24, 1994, the licensee may file a request for a hearing with 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
respect to issuance of the amendment to the subject facility operating 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
license and any person whose interest may be affected by this proceeding 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and who wishes to participate as a party in the proceeding must file a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
written request for a hearing and a petition for leave to intervene. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Requests for a hearing and a petition for leave to intervene shall be filed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in accordance with the Commission's ``Rules of Practice for Domestic 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Licensing Proceedings'' in 10 CFR Part 2. Interested persons should consult 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a current copy of 10 CFR 2.714 which is available at the Commission's 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Public Document Room, the Gelman Building, 2120 L Street, NW., Washington, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
DC 20555 and at the local public document room for the particular facility 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
involved. If a request for a hearing or petition for leave to intervene is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
filed by the above date, the Commission or an Atomic Safety and Licensing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Board, designated by the Commission or by the Chairman of the Atomic Safety 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and Licensing Board Panel, will rule on the request and/or petition; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the Secretary or the designated Atomic Safety and Licensing Board will 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
issue a notice of a hearing or an appropriate order. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As required by 10 CFR 2.714, a petition for leave to intervene shall 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
set forth with particularity the interest of the petitioner in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proceeding, and how that interest may be affected by the results of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proceeding. The petition should specifically explain the reasons why 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
intervention should be permitted with particular reference to the following 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
factors: (1) The nature of the petitioner's right under the Act to be made 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a party to the proceeding; (2) the nature and extent of the petitioner's 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
property, financial, or other interest in the proceeding; and (3) the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
possible effect of any order which may be entered in the proceeding on the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
petitioner's interest. The petition should also identify the specific 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
aspect(s) of the subject matter of the proceeding as to which petitioner 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
wishes to intervene. Any person who has filed a petition for leave to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
intervene or who has been admitted as a party may amend the petition 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
without requesting leave of the Board up to 15 days prior to the first 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
prehearing conference scheduled in the proceeding, but such an amended 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
petition must satisfy the specificity requirements described above. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Not later than 15 days prior to the first prehearing conference 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
scheduled in the proceeding, a petitioner shall file a supplement to the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
petition to intervene which must include a list of the contentions which 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
are sought to be litigated in the matter. Each contention must consist of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a specific statement of the issue of law or fact to be raised or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
controverted. In addition, the petitioner shall provide a brief 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
explanation of the bases of the contention and a concise statement of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
alleged facts or expert opinion which support the contention and on which 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the petitioner intends to rely in proving the contention at the hearing. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The petitioner must also provide references to those specific sources and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
documents of which the petitioner is aware and on which the petitioner 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
intends to rely to establish those facts or expert opinion. Petitioner 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
must provide sufficient information to show that a genuine dispute exists 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
with the applicant on a material issue of law or fact. Contentions shall 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
be limited to matters within the scope of the amendment under 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
consideration. The contention must be one which, if proven, would entitle 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the petitioner to relief. A petitioner who fails to file such a supplement 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
which satisfies these requirements with respect to at least one contention 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
will not be permitted to participate as a party. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Those permitted to intervene become parties to the proceeding, subject 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to any limitations in the order granting leave to intervene, and have the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
opportunity to participate fully in the conduct of the hearing, including 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the opportunity to present evidence and cross-examine witnesses. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If a hearing is requested, the Commission will make a final 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
determination on the issue of no significant hazards consideration. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
final determination will serve to decide when the hearing is held. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If the final determination is that the amendment request involves no 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
significant hazards consideration, the Commission may issue the amendment 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and make it immediately effective, notwithstanding the request for a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
hearing. Any hearing held would take place after issuance of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
amendment.

1. The proposed amendment does not involve a significant increase in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated because the proposed change [sic] is administrative
in nature. These changes do not alter the configuration or operation of the facility. The Limiting Safety Systems
Settings and Safety Limits specified in the current Technical 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Specifications remain unchanged. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. The proposed amendment does not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously
evaluated. The safety analysis of the facility remains complete and accurate. There are no physical changes to the
facility and the plant conditions for which the design basis accidents have been evaluated are still valid. The operating
procedure and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
emergency procedures are unaffected with the possible exception of resolving special notations that may have recognized
the typographical errors that are being corrected. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. The margins of safety are established through the Limiting Conditions of Operation, Limiting Safety Systems Settings
and Safety Limits specified in the Technical Specifications. Since there are no changes to the physical design or
operation of the facility, these margins will not be changed.

As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee has provided its analysis of the issue of no significant hazards consideration,
which is presented below: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed changes do not involve an [significant hazards 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
consideration] SHC because the changes would not:

<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
1. Involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of an accident previously evaluated. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed change modifies SR 4.6.1.2.d. Currently this SR indicates the purge supply and exhaust valves have an
exception from the 10CFR50 Appendix J, Type B and C tests. The proposed technical specification change is consistent
with current surveillance procedures and the [Final Safety Analysis Report] 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FSAR. The second proposed change, which removes SR 4.6.1.2.f, reflects current containment leakage surveillance
requirements. The present location of SR 4.6.1.2.f could imply that containment leakage surveillance requirements
are met by performing SR 4.9.9. However, SR 4.9.9 is applicable only during core alterations or movement of irradiated
fuel and not during the modes when 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Technical Specification 3.6.1.2 is applicable. These changes have no effect on actual Appendix J testing of valves
or the current plant accident analysis. Therefore, the proposed changes cannot increase the probability or consequences
of an accident previously evaluated. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. Create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
from any previously analyzed. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed changes do not introduce any new failure modes. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
plant will continue to operate as designed and there will be no 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
change to the testing of valves. The proposed changes will not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
modify the plant response to the point where it can be considered 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a new accident. Therefore, the proposed changes will not create 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the possibility of a new or different kind of accident form any 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
previously evaluated. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. Involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed changes modify SR 4.6.1.2.d which, as presently 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
written, indicates that the purge supply and exhaust valves are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
an exception to the 10CFR50 Appendix J, Type B and C test and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
therefore, no exception is required. This is supported by 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
current surveillance procedures which include the purge supply 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and exhaust valves as part of the Type B and C tests. In 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
addition, the proposed changes are consistent with the FSAR. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FSAR Table 7.3&hyph;1 ``Containment Penetrations,'' lists the purge 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
supply and exhaust valves as required to receive Type B and C 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
tests. Therefore, these proposed changes revise SR 4.6.1.2.d to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reflect actual surveillance procedures and offer no revisions or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reductions to current surveillance testing. Therefore, these 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
changes will not result in a significant reduction in the margin 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of safety.

Description of amendment request: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposed amendment request would revise the Technical Specifications to amend Sections 3.1.F and 4.13 to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
allow the repair of steam generator tubes by sleeving as an alternative to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
plugging. Additionally, a new tube acceptance criteria, F*, is proposed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
which would allow tubes that are degraded in a location not affecting 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
structural integrity of the tube to remain in service. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
(1) Involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of an accident previously evaluated since the integrity of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
steam generator tubes after sleeving will be equivalent to that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of the original tubes. The sleeve, sleeve joint, and F* joint 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
have been analyzed and tested for design, operating, and faulted 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
condition loadings in accordance with NRC Regulatory [G]uide 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1.121 safety factors. The potential for a tube rupture is not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
increased with sleeving or F*. At worst case, a tube leak would 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
occur, resulting in a small primary to secondary leak. Primary 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to secondary leakage occurring from within the sleeved or F* 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
portions of the tube is bounded by the steam generator tube 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
rupture scenario evaluated in the Final Safety Analysis Report. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition, the steam generator tube remains capable of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
performing its required heat transfer function. Placing a sleeve 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in the steam generator tube or leaving a tube in service with a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
defect in a portion of the tube that provides no function results 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in a more efficient steam generator than plugging an affected 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
tube. Thus, the consequences of any accident previously 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
evaluated are not increased because the structural integrity and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the heat transfer capability of the steam generators are not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
significantly altered by the proposed change. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
from any accident previously evaluated because both the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
structural integrity and the heat transfer capability of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
steam generators will not be significantly affected by the use of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
either of the sleeving processes or the implementation of the F* 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
criteria. Testing and previous experience indicate that any 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
primary to secondary leakage would be well below technical 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
specification limits. In addition, in the unlikely event the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
defective tube failed completely at the defect, the remaining 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
sleeve end or F* joint would restrain tube movement due to the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
sleeve end geometry or length of expanded contact within the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
tubesheet bore. Therefore, there is no threat to adjacent tubes 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and no other plant systems will be affected by this change. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Thus, there is no potential for a new or different kind of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
accident. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety. The heat 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
transfer capabilities of Indian Point 2 Steam Generators will be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
improved by utilizing the proposed sleeving process or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
implementing the F* criteria rather than the currently required 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
tube plugging and subsequent loss of heat transfer area. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proposed change will allow a repaired (sleeved) tube or a tube 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
with a tube end defect below the F* distance to remain in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
service, rather than completely blocking the tube's flow with 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
plugs. Because the structural integrity of the tubes will be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
unaltered, the net effect of implementing the proposed change, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
rather than the currently required plugging procedure, will be an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
increase in the heat transfer characteristics of the steam 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
generator. Westinghouse has done an evaluation of selected LOCA 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
[loss-of-coolant accident] and non-LOCA transients to verify that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
use of sleeves resulting in a plugging equivalency at the current 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
plant limit will not have an adverse affect on the thermal-hydraulic performance of the plant. Therefore, the margin
of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
safety is not reduced.

Description of amendment request:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The amendment request, as submitted 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
November 15, 1991, proposed completely rewritten requirements for the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
instrumentation and control (I&amp;C) sections of the Palisades Technical 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Specifications (TS) and was initially noticed in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
October 28, 1992 (57 FR 48819). Since that time the licensee has updated 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
its submittal, providing (1) changes to pages affected by intervening 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
amendments, (2) clarifications suggested by NRC and Palisades reviewers, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) addition of two instrument channels to the accident monitoring 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
instruments Limiting Condition for Operation (LCO), (4) deletion of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
surveillance requirements for safety injection tank (SIT) instruments, as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
suggested by Generic Letter (GL) 93&hyph;05, ``Line-Item Technical Specifications 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Improvements to Reduce Surveillance Requirements for Testing During Power 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Operation,'' and (5) addition of a general ``Applicability'' LCO which appears 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in the Standard TS but not in the Palisades TS. Changes (4) and (5) were 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
not addressed in the initial proposed no significant hazards consideration (NSH) determination. The licensee's
NSH analysis for these two changes was 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
provided in its April 7, 1994, letter to the NRC and is discussed below.

Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee has provided its analysis of the issue of no significant hazards consideration,
which is presented below:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
Consumers Power Company finds that activities associated with the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
February 22, 1994 and March 11, 1994 Instrument and Control 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Technical Specification change revisions include no significant 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
hazards; and accordingly, a no significant hazards determination 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in accordance with 10CFR50.92(c) is justified. The following 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
summary supports the finding that the proposed change would not: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
Involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of an accident previously evaluated. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Neither the deletion of instrument surveillance requirements for the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Safety Injection Tank (SIT) instrumentation nor the addition of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
allowance of temporarily returning inoperable equipment to service for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
maintenance or testing would affect the probability or consequences of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
an accident. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The SIT instrument channels themselves have no accident function. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Their only purpose is to allow verification that the SITs themselves 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
are operable. Surveillance requirements for these instruments were 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
purposely deleted from STS during the Technical Specification 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Improvement Program. Their removal from Technical Specifications was 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
suggested in GL 93&hyph;05. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Returning inoperable equipment to service as allowed by LCO 3.0.5 is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
necessary if failed channels are to be restored to operable status. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The restoration of such channels enhances the ability to monitor for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and mitigate abnormal operating conditions and accidents. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Therefore, the proposed changes do not involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident
previously 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
evaluated.

any accident previously evaluated. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed changes would not alter the operating conditions of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
plant systems, and would not reduce the reliability of any plant 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
safety equipment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Therefore, this change does not create the possibility of a new or

different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
Involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed changes would not affect the setpoints, capacities, or

operating limits for any equipment. Therefore, the proposed changes 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
do not involve a significant reduction of a margin of safety.

Description of amendment request:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The proposed amendment would change certain Technical Specifications (TS) to relocate fuel cycle-specific 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
parameter limits that can generally change with core reloads to a Core 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Operating Limits Report (COLR) in accordance with the guidance of Generic 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Letter 88&hyph;16, ``Removal of Cycle-Specific Parameter Limits from Technical 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Specifications.'' Several of the TS bases would also be revised to refer to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
limits relocated to the COLR. In each case where TS limits would be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
relocated to the COLR, the limits placed in the COLR would be unchanged and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the appropriate bases would be revised accordingly. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee has provided its analysis of the issue of no significant hazards consideration,
which is presented below: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The following evaluation supports the finding that operation of the facility in accordance with the proposed TS would
not: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

Involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of an accident previously evaluated. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed changes to the TS simply move the values and parameters 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for fuel cycle-specific limits from the TS to a Core Operating Limits 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Report (COLR). The requirements to maintain the plant within 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
appropriate bounds are retained in the TS. The values of the cycle-specific parameter limits in the COLR are determined
using an NRC-approved methodology and remain consistent with all applicable limits 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of the plant safety analyses that are addressed in the Final Safety 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Analysis Report (FSAR). A requirements for the COLR and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
identification of the approved methodology documents are added to the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
TS. There are no associated changes in plant operation. Therefore, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
operation of the facility in accordance with the proposed TS would not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
result in a significant increase in the probability or consequences of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
an accident previously evaluated. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
Create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
any previously evaluated. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As discussed above, the proposed changes do not remove or alleviate 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
any requirements to maintain the plant within the appropriate bounds. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
There are no associated changes in plant operation. Therefore, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
operation of the facility in accordance with the proposed TS would not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
previously evaluated. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. Involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed changes to the TS simply move the values and parameters 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for cycle-specific limits from the Specifications to a Core Operating 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Limits Report (COLR). The requirements to maintain the plant within 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
appropriate bounds are retained in the TS. The values of the cycle-specific parameter limits in the COLR are determined
using an NRC-approved methodology and remain consistent with all applicable limits 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of the plant safety analyses that are addressed in the Final Safety

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of the approved methodology documents are added to the TS. There are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
no associated changes in plant operation. Therefore, operation of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
facility in accordance with the proposed TS would not involve a

 The proposed amendment would modify the surveillance requirements for scram discharge volume vent and drain valves

1. The proposed changes do not involve a significant increase in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed changes to the frequency of testing for these 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
components will reduce the probability of failure due to wear and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
eliminate the possibility of initiating transients during testing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of these components. Therefore, the proposed changes will result 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in a decrease in the probability of previously evaluated 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
accidents. Further, the proposed changes do not alter the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
design, function, or operation of the components involved and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
therefore, do not affect the consequences of any previously 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
evaluated accident. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. The proposed changes do not create the possibility of a new or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
different kind of accident from any accident previously 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
evaluated. As stated above, the proposed changes do not alter 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the design, function, or operation of the components involved and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
therefore, no new accident scenarios are created. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. The proposed changes do not involve a significant reduction in a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
margin of safety. As developed in Reference 3 [NUREG&hyph;1366, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
``Improvement to Technical Specification Surveillance 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Requirements,'' dated December 1992] and endorsed in Reference 2 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
[GL 93&hyph;05], the proposed changes to the testing frequency will 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
increase the margin of safety through reduced equipment wear and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
elimination of opportunities to induce transients.

Requirements and associated Actions are not affected and remain 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in the Technical Specifications. Relocating this information 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
does not affect the initial conditions of a design basis accident 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
or transient analysis. Since any subsequent changes to the UFSAR 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
or procedures are evaluated in accordance with 10 CFR 50.59, no 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
increase in the probability or consequences of an accident 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
previously evaluated is allowed. Further, the proposed changes 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
do not alter the design, function, or operation of the components 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
involved and therefore, do not affect the consequences of any 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
previously evaluated accident. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. The proposed changes do not create the possibility of a new or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
different kind of accident from any accident previously 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
evaluated. The proposed changes will not impose any different 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
operational or surveillance requirements. The changes propose to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
relocate these response time limit tables to other plant 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
documents whereby adequate control of information is maintained. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Further, as stated above, the proposed changes do not alter the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
design, function, or operation of the components involved and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
therefore, no new accident scenarios are created. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. The proposed changes do not involve a significant reduction in a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
margin of safety. The proposed change will not reduce a margin 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of safety because it has no impact on any safety analysis 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
assumption. The proposed change does not alter the scope of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
equipment currently required to be OPERABLE or subject to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
surveillance testing nor does the proposed change affect any 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
instrument setpoints or equipment safety functions. In addition, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the values to be transposed from the Technical Specifications to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the UFSAR are the same as the exiting Technical Specifications. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Since any future changes to these requirements in the UFSAR or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
procedures will be evaluated per the requirements of 10 CFR 50.59, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
no reduction in a margin of safety is allowed. Therefore, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
change does not involve a significant reduction in margin of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
safety.

Description of amendment request:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The proposed amendments would allow the analog channel operational test interval for radiation monitoring 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
instrumentation to be increased from monthly to quarterly. The proposed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
amendments are said by the licensee to be consistent with NRC staff 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
recommendations and guidance contained in NUREG&hyph;1366, ``Improvements to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Technical Specifications Surveillance Requirements,'' and Generic Letter 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee has provided its analysis of the issue of no significant hazards consideration,
which is presented below: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=73 g=1 f=1 -->
Criterion 1 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
The requested amendments will not involve a significant increase in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Decreasing the frequency of the radiation monitor analog channel 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
operational test from monthly to quarterly will have no impact upon 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the probability of any accident, since the radiation monitors are not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
accident initiating equipment. Also, no credit is taken in accident 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
analyses for automatic actions performed by radiation monitors 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
contained in Catawba's Technical Specifications, so the requested 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
amendments will have no adverse impact upon the consequences of any 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
accident. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=73 g=1 f=1 -->
Criterion 2 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
The requested amendments will not create the possibility of a new or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated. As 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
stated above, the radiation monitors are not accident initiating 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
equipment. No new failure modes can be created from an accident 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
standpoint. The plant will not be operated in a different manner. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=73 g=1 f=1 -->
Criterion 3 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
The requested amendments will not involve a significant reduction in a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
margin of safety. Plant safety margins will be unaffected by the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proposed changes. No safety equipment which is taken credit for in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
accident analyses will be affected by the requested amendments. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
availability of the affected radiation monitors will be increased as a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
result of the proposed amendments because the monitors will not have 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to be made unavailable for testing as frequently. In addition, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
radiation monitor operating experience supports the proposed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
amendments. Finally, the proposed amendments are consistent with the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
NRC position and guidance set forth in NUREG&hyph;1366 and Generic Letter 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
93&hyph;05. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Based upon the preceding analyses, Duke Power Company concludes that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the requested amendments do not involve a significant hazards 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
consideration.

Description of amendment request:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The licensee proposes to change Turkey Point Units 3 and 4 Technical Specifications (TS) 4.0.5 a, ``Applicability_Surveillance
Requirements.'' The licensee proposes to delete the wording ``.&blank;.&blank;. (g), except where specific written
relief has been granted by the Commission pursuant to 10 CFR, Section 50.55a(g)(6)(i)'' in TS 4.0.5 a, for the inservice
inspection and testing programs. With the revisions to the Technical Specifications, upon finding an ASME Code requirement
impractical because of prohibitive dose rates or limitations in the design, construction, or system configuration,
the licensee may implement the relief request once it has been submitted to the NRC provided it has been: (1) Acceptably
reviewed pursuant to 10 CFR 50.59; (2) approved by the plant staff in accordance with the administrative process described
in the inservice inspection and testing programs administrative procedures; and (3) reviewed and approved by the
Plant Nuclear Safety Committee.

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
(1) Operation of the facility in accordance with the proposed amendments would not involve a significant increase
in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed amendments remove the wording ``.&blank;.&blank;. (g), except where specific written relief has been
granted by the Commission pursuant to 10 CFR, Section 50.55a(g)(6)(i)'', provided a 10 CFR 50.59 evaluation is performed.
The Inservice Inspection and Testing Programs are described in the Technical Specifications pursuant to 10 CFR 50.55a.
In addition, the proposed amendments, in accordance with NUREG 1431 and draft NUREG 1482, provide relief to the ASME
code requirement in the interim between the time of submittal of a relief request until the NRC has issued a safety evaluation
and granted the relief. The changes being proposed are administrative in nature and do not affect assumptions contained
in plant safety analyses, the physical design and/or operation of the plant, nor do they affect Technical Specifications
that preserve safety analysis assumptions. Any relief from the approved ASME Section XI code requirements will require
a 10 CFR 50.59 evaluation to ensure no Technical Specification changes or unreviewed safety questions exist. Therefore,
operation of the facility in accordance with the proposed amendments would not affect the probability or consequences
of an accident previously analyzed. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Operation of the facility in accordance with the proposed amendments would not create the possibility of a new
or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The changes being proposed are administrative in nature and will not change the physical plant or the modes of operation
defined in the Facility License. The change does not involve the addition or modification of equipment nor does it
alter the design or operation of plant systems. Any reliefs from the approved ASME Section XI code requirements will
require a 10 CFR 50.59 evaluation to ensure no Technical Specification changes or unreviewed safety questions exist.
Therefore, operation of the facility in accordance with the proposed amendments would not create the possibility
of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated.

Description of amendment request: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The licensee proposes to change Turkey Point Units 3 and 4 Technical Specifications by increasing the surveillance
interval specified for air or smoke flow test through the containment spray header from ``at least once per 5 years''
to ``at least once per 10 years.'' The licensee stated that the proposed surveillance interval is consistent with
both Generic Letter 93&hyph;05, ``Line-Item Technical Specifications Improvements to Reduce Surveillance Requirements

(1) Operation of the facility in accordance with the proposed amendments would not involve a significant increase
in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed amendments extend the surveillance interval required for performing a qualitative smoke or air flow
test on the containment spray headers. This surveillance test is not designed to track degradation of equipment by
monitoring or trending performance. The air and smoke flow test is a test of the passive design of the containment spray
nozzles, i.e., the testing demonstrates whether or not the nozzles are clogged. A single failure rendering a significant
number of nozzles inoperable as a result of clogging is considered not credible. The changes being proposed do not
affect assumptions contained in plant safety analyses, the physical design and/or operation of the plant, nor do
they affect Technical Specifications that preserve safety analysis assumptions. Therefore, operation of the facility
in accordance with the proposed amendments would not involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences
of an accident previously analyzed.

1. These changes do not affect the function of any system or component. Therefore, they do not increase the probability
of occurrence or consequence of an accident previously evaluated in the [Safety Analysis Report] SAR. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. These changes do not involve a physical change to plant configuration and they do not affect the performance of any
equipment. Therefore, they do not create the possibility of an accident or malfunction of a different type than previously
identified. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

3. The shifting of the audit frequency requirements from the Technical Specifications to the OQA Plan and the extension
of the maximum interval between audits of certain areas do not change the activities to be audited nor the scope of individual
audits. Furthermore, audit frequencies are not associated with the margin of safety in the bases of any Technical
Specification.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Therefore, the margin of safety is not affected by this change.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The proposed change updates and clarifies Technical Specification 3.4.B.1 to be consistent with existing Specifications
1.39 and 4.3.D (ASME Code Section XI, Article 5000 requirements). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The requested change would delete reference to the ASME Code Section XI, IS&hyph;5000 ten year hydrotest inspection
interval and replace this with references to: (1) The Technical Specification 1.39 definition for Reactor Vessel
Pressure Testing, and (2) the Technical Specification 3.3.A.(i) Reactor Vessel Pressure Testing limits (P/T and
250

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The requested change will clarify that the five electromatic relief valves' (EMRV) pressure relief function may
be inoperable or bypassed during system pressure testing required by ASME Code Section XI, Article IWA&hyph;5000,
including system leakage and hydrostatic test, with reactor vessel completely solid, core not critical and Technical
Specification 3.2.A (Core Reactivity limits) satisfied.

1. The requested change will not involve a significant increase in the probability or consequence of any accident
previously evaluated because this change: (a) Merely updates and clarifies Technical Specification 3.4.B.1 to
be consistent with other existing Technical Specifications, (b) contains no adverse changes to any existing safety
function necessary for the reactor vessel solid, core not critical condition, and (c) makes no modification or physical
changes to plant equipment, performance or operation necessary to respond to accidents for the reactor vessel solid,
core not critical condition. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. The requested change does not create the possibility of a new or different accident from any accident previously
evaluated because this change: (a) Merely updates and clarifies Technical Specification 3.4.B.1 to be consistent
with other existing Technical Specifications, (b) contains no adverse changes to any existing safety function necessary
for the reactor vessel solid, core not critical condition, and (c) over pressure protection would continue to be provided
by the code safety valves when the EMRV pressure relief function is bypassed. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. A significant reduction in margin of safety is not involved because even though the EMRV pressure relief function
is bypassed, over pressure protection would continue to be provided by the code safety valves. Elimination of this
relief function does not affect the reactor safety analysis, since credit was not taken for the EMRV pressure relief
function .&blank;.&blank;. .

Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee has provided its analysis of the issue of no significant hazards consideration,
which is presented below: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
Does the change involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated?

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This change request proposes deletion of Technical Specification 3/4.3.8, ``Turbine Overspeed Protection System''
and relocates this requirement to an existing plant program. The purpose of overspeed protection is to minimize the
possible generation of turbine fragment missiles. Excessive overspeed could potentially result in the generation
of missiles which could impact and damage safety related components, equipment or structures, depending on the size
and trajectory of the missiles. The proposed deletion of this specification is based on the low probability of the
generation of a damaging turbine missile and other existing performance verifications of the overspeed protection
system. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The turbine-generator orientation at RBS [River Bend Station] is a ``favorable'' orientation for reducing the probability
of damage to safety-related equipment from turbine missiles since all safety-related components and structures
are located in the axial direction from the turbine-generator. Turbine Overspeed Protection System is necessary
for protection of the turbine from only an operational and economic point of view. The system is not essential to mitigating
the consequences of an accident. The system is not used in an initial condition of a design basis accident or transient
analysis. The probability of damage to safety-related equipment based on turbine manufacturer's turbine failure
data was calculated to be 1.473&times;10
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=5 f=1 -->
^8
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
 per year and is acceptably low based on the probability of turbine failure data of 4.75x10
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=5 f=1 -->
^7
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
 per year as recommended by NUREG&hyph;0800. Therefore, this proposed change does not involve a significant increase
in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Does the change create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated?

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The change proposes to relocate this requirement to an existing plant program, whereby adequate control of information
is maintained. The proposed change does not necessitate a physical alteration of the plant (no new or different type
of equipment will be installed) or changes to parameters governing normal plant operation. The proposed change will
not impose any different operational or surveillance requirements. No new failure modes are introduced. Therefore,
this proposed change does not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously
evaluated. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Does the change involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed change will not reduce a margin of safety because it has no impact on any safety analysis assumption. The
proposed change does not alter the scope of equipment currently required to be OPERABLE or subject to surveillance
testing, nor does the proposed change affect any instrument setpoints or equipment safety functions. The favorable
orientation of the turbine provides a margin of safety such that the possibility of missile damage to safety-related
equipment is acceptably low. Therefore the change does not involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety.

Description of amendment request:

 The licensee proposes to revise Technical Specification Surveillance Requirement 4.6.1.3.e to add an option which
will allow the personnel airlock pneumatic system leak test to be completed in 8 hours with a pressure drop of 0.50 psi.
The technical specifications currently require that the door seal pneumatic system be demonstrated operable by
verifying that the system pressure does not decay more than 1.5 psi within 24 hours. The change to an 8-hour test will
expedite return to power following an outage since the test is on the critical path for restart following outages.

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
1. The proposed change does not involve a significant increase in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the probability or consequences of an accident previously 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
evaluated. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The door pneumatic seal system pressure drop test is not altered 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
except for providing an option to utilize a reduced test 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
duration. A conservative acceptance criteria of 0.50 psi will be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
assigned to the optional short duration test thus maintaining the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
operability of the pneumatic seal system. The proposed change 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
does not alter equipment or assumptions made in previously 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
evaluated accidents, therefore the consequences of previously 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
evaluated accidents are not increased. The probability of an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
accident is also unaffected because the seals are not a potential 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
accident initiator. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. The proposed change does not create the possibility of a new or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
different kind of accident from any accident previously 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
evaluated. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
With a conservative acceptance criteria of 0.50 psi assigned to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the optional 8 hour door pneumatic seal system pressure drop test 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the capability of the door pneumatic seal system to maintain 65 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
psig to the airlock seals, for a minimum of 15 days upon a loss 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of instrument air, is assured. Loss of plant supply air is the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
accident evaluated in the UFSAR [Updated Final Safety Analysis 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Report] section 3.8.2.1.2 and plant specification 2C269SS0006. The proposed change does not create the possibility
of a new or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
different kind of accident from any previously evaluated. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. The proposed change does not involve a significant reduction in a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
margin of safety. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
To ensure the pneumatic seal system pressure drop test is not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
compromised, a conservative acceptance criteria of 0.50 psi will 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
be assigned to the 8 hour test. With the conservative acceptance 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
criteria, the proposed change does not involve a significant 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reduction in the margin of safety previously evaluated.

the time within which the Nuclear Safety Audit Review Committee (NSARC) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
must issue reports and minutes, and to incorporate a number of editorial 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
changes. The editorial changes would delete certain items that are no

longer applicable, would remove inconsistencies involving the names of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
systems and equipment and NSARC function, composition, and use of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
alternates, and would correct the value for the reactor coolant system 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
volume. Other editorial changes would be made for document format 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
consistency. The proposed amendment would affect the following TS Sections

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee has provided its analysis of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
issue of no significant hazards consideration. The NRC staff has reviewed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the licensee's analysis against the standards of 10 CFR 50.92(c). The NRC 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
staff's review is presented below. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A. The changes do not involve a significant increase in the probability 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
or consequences of an accident previously evaluated (10 CFR 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
50.92(c)(1)). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed redefinition of the composition of the SORC would not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
diminish the effectiveness of the SORC and would continue to ensure 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that the SORC has the desired experience and expertise to advise the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Station Manager on all matters related to nuclear safety. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proposed change would permit operational flexibility and eliminate the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
need for an amendment whenever organizational changes occur. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed SQRP would not reduce the level of procedure review, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
since the SORC continues to retain responsibility to review any 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
document requiring an evaluation pursuant to 10 CFR 50.59. The SQRP 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
would be limited to reviewing procedures that do not affect nuclear 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
safety. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Deleting the requirement to periodically review procedures would not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
diminish the review process for procedures since other programmatic 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requirements would continue to assure procedures are reviewed and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
revised when necessary.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposed extension of time for preparing and forwarding NSARC 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
meeting minutes would not affect safe operation of the facility. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Significant safety concerns or unreviewed safety questions would still 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
be brought to the attention of the Senior Vice President without 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
waiting for the release of the NSARC meeting minutes. The change 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
would not impede in any manner prompt communication of significant 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
concerns to the Senior Vice President. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed changes do not affect the manner by which the facility is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
operated and do not change any facility design feature or equipment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed changes involve administrative or programmatic 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requirements or merely involve editorial changes, corrections, or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
clarifications. Since there is no change to the facility or operating 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
procedures, there is no effect upon the probability or consequences of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
any accident previously analyzed. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
B. The changes do not create the possibility of a new or different kind 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of accident from any accident previously evaluated (10 CFR 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
50.92(c)(2)) because they do not affect the manner by which the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
facility is operated and do not change any facility design feature or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
equipment which affects the operational characteristics of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
facility. The proposed changes involve administrative or programmatic 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requirements or merely involve editorial changes, corrections, or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
clarifications. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
C. The changes do not involve a significant reduction in a margin of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
safety (10 CFR 50.92(c)(3)) because the proposed changes do not affect 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the manner by which the facility is operated or involve equipment or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
features which affect the operational characteristics of the facility. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Based on this review, it appears that the three standards of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
10 CFR 50.92(c) are satisfied. Therefore, the NRC staff proposes to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
determine that the amendment request involves no significant hazards 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
consideration.

Description of amendment request: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposed amendment would remove two tables from the Technical Specifications (TS) which list reactor trip system
(RTS) instrumentation response times and engineered safety features actuation system (ESFAS) instrumentation
response times. These tables will be placed in the Millstone 3 Technical Requirements Manual.

Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee has provided its analysis of the issue of no significant hazards consideration,
which is presented below: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed changes do not involve a significant hazards consideration because the changes would not:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
1. Involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed changes to remove the RTS and ESFAS response times from the Technical Specifications will not affect
the operation of the RTS and ESFAS. Operability and surveillance requirements are still maintained in the Technical
Specifications and the response times will be included and maintained in the plant operating procedures. A safety
evaluation and PORC [Plant Operations Review Committee] review will be required for the limits to be changed. Since
the systems will not be affected by the proposed changes, there is no impact on the performance of these systems or the
consequences of an accident previously analyzed.

2. Create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
from any previously evaluated. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
There are no new failure modes associated with the proposed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
changes. Since the plant will continue to operate as designed, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the proposed changes will not modify the plant response to the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
point where it can be considered a new accident. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. Involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed changes do not have any adverse impact on the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
protective boundaries nor do they affect the consequences of any 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
accident previously analyzed. The Technical Specification 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
operability and surveillance requirements will still ensure that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the systems are tested and within the limits. Changing the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
limits requires a safety evaluation and PORC review which will 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ensure that the licensing basis is maintained. Therefore, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proposed changes will not impact the margin of safety as defined 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in the basis of any Technical Specification.

 As 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee has provided its analysis of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
issue of no significant hazards consideration, which is presented below: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed technical specification change has been reviewed against 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the criteria of 10 CFR 50.92, and it has been determined not to involve 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a significant hazards consideration (SHC). Specifically, the proposed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
change does not: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
1. Involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of an accident previously analyzed. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Deleting the operability and surveillance requirements for the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
condenser air ejector monitor from Tables 3.3&hyph;12 and 4.3&hyph;12 of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the Millstone Unit No. 2 Technical Specifications would leave the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
steam generator blowdown monitor as the primary method of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
monitoring and isolating steam generator blowdown. The proposed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
license amendment imposes stricter limitations on the operation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of Millstone Unit No. 2, because it requires the use of a single 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
monitor, the steam generator blowdown monitor, to meet the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requirements of Millstone Unit No. 2 Technical Specification 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3.3.3.9 (Table 3.3&hyph;12). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
While NNECO [Northeast Nuclear Energy Company] is proposing to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
delete the operability and surveillance requirements for the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
condenser air ejector monitor from the Millstone Unit No. 2 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Technical Specifications, there are no plans to change any of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
design features or functions or the condenser air ejector 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
monitor, or any of the specified surveillances or frequency for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
such surveillances. The condenser air ejector monitor will 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
continue to isolate blowdown upon a high radiation alarm. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Additionally, steam generator blowdown isolation is required to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ensure compliance with 10 CFR 20. It is not required to ensure 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
compliance with 10 CFR 100. Therefore, the condenser air ejector 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
monitor does not perform any safety function. The condenser air 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ejector monitor is not safety related. It is not credited in any 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
radiological consequence calculations presented in the Millstone 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Unit No. 2 FSAR [Final Safety Analysis Report]. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Based on the above, this proposed license amendment does not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of an accident previously evaluated. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. Create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
form any accident previously evaluated. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed license amendment does not involve any physical 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
changes to plant equipment or any changes to plant procedures 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that would be a precursor to an accident. NNECO has no plans to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
change any of the specified surveillances or frequency for such 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
surveillances. The condenser air ejector monitor will continue 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to isolate blowdown upon a high radiation alarm. Also, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proposed license amendment imposes stricter limitations on the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
operation of Millstone Unit No. 2 because it requires the use of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a single monitor, the steam generator blowdown monitor, to meet 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the requirements of Millstone Unit No. 2 Technical Specification 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3.3.3.9 (Table 3.3&hyph;12). Therefore, this proposed license 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
amendment does not create the possibility of a new or different 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
kind of accident form any accident previously evaluated. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. Involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Deleting the operability and surveillance requirements for the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
condenser air ejector monitor from Tables 3.3&hyph;12 and 4.3&hyph;12 of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the Millstone Unit No. 2 Technical Specifications would leave the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
steam generator blowdown monitor as the primary method of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
monitoring and isolating steam generator blowdown. The proposed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
license amendment imposes stricter limitations on the operation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of Millstone Unit No. 2, because it requires the use of a single 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requirements of Millstone Unit No. 2 Technical Specification 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3.3.3.9 (Table 3.3&hyph;12). Therefore, this proposed license 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
amendment does not impact or reduce the margin of safety.

Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 As 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee has provided its analysis of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
issue of no significant hazards consideration, which is presented below: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
NNECO [Northeast Nuclear Energy Company] has reviewed the proposed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
changes in accordance with 10 CFR 50.90 and has concluded that the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
changes do not involve a significant hazards consideration (SHC). The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
basis for this conclusion is that the three criteria of 10 CFR 50.92(c) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
are not compromised. The proposed changes do not involve an SHC 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
because the changes would not:

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
1. Involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of an accident previously analyzed. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
NNECO's proposal to eliminate the CPS scale for the ``Wide Range 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Logarithmic Neutron Flux Monitor'' entry in Millstone Unit No. 2 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Technical Specification Table 3.3&hyph;9 will not affect the ability 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of Millstone Unit No. 2 to meet the intent and purpose of panel 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
C&hyph;21's original design. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The 10
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=5 f=1 -->
^8
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
% to 100% power scale overlaps the CPS scale. The range 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of 10
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=5 f=1 -->
^8
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
% to 100% power for the ``Wide Range Logarithmic Neutron 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Flux Monitor'' is adequate to permit the operators to bring the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
unit to hot shutdown from outside the control room. Also, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
instruments on C&hyph;21 are not used to provide the start-up rate 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
signal during start-up or refueling operations. This proposed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
license amendment does not impact the performance of any safety-related component, system, or structure. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A review of the original design drawings concluded that this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proposed change is consistent with the original plant design, and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reflects the actual as-built condition of the unit. The original 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
design drawings show that the wide range logarithmic neutron flux 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
indicators only receive a percent power signal. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
NNECO's proposals to rectify a few typographical and editorial 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
errors on page V of the Index for the Millstone Unit No. 2 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Technical Specifications are administrative in nature. They 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ensure that the Index accurately reflects the contents of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
technical specifications. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Based on the above, the proposed license amendment does not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

 The proposed amendment would change the

Technical Specifications concerning four related issues: (1) Power-operated 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
relief valve (PORV) and block valve reliability; (2) low-temperature

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
management. Specifically, the proposed amendment would revise Technical

Specifications 3.4.3 and 3.4.9.3 to address the issues specifically raised

in Generic Letter (GL) 90&hyph;06. Technical Specifications 3.1.1.3, 3.1.2.1,

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposed changes address the operability and surveillance requirements for the charging pump, HPSI [high-pressure
safety injection] pumps, reactor coolant pumps, safety valves, PORVs, block valves, and the LTOP, boron dilution
and SDC [shutdown cooling] systems. These changes were proposed to address four main issues: to reflect the guidance
of GL 90&hyph;06 with respect to PORV and cold overpressure; to address boron dilution concerns; to address shutdown
risk management lessons learned; and to address recent information on cold overpressure mitigation concerns. Generally,
the changes are more restrictive than present requirements and are consistent with the recommendations of GL 90&hyph;06.
Also, the changes provide the operator with additional guidance that was not previously available. Therefore, the
changes will not impact the probability of occurrence or consequences of an LTOP event, boron dilution event, loss
of shutdown cooling, or other event requiring emergency core cooling which has been previously analyzed. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=73 g=1 f=1 -->
PORV Requirements 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposed changes to Technical Specification 3.4.3 have been made to be consistent with GL 90&hyph;06. One enhancement
has been made to the guidance contained in GL 90&hyph;06 and that was to replace the phrase ``because of excessive seat
leakage'' with the phrase ``and capable of being manually cycled.'' Although the PORV may be designated inoperable,
it may be able to be manually opened and closed and in this manner can be used to mitigate transients. For example, PORV
inoperability may be due to seat leakage, instrumentation problems, automatic control problems, or other causes
that do not prevent manual use and do not create a possibility for a small break LOCA. The wording changes are meant to
be more specific while meeting the intent of GL 90&hyph;06. The additional enhancement to GL 90&hyph;06 includes
Surveillance Requirement 4.4.3.1c whereby Millstone Unit No. 2 proposed to bench test the PORVs at a qualified laboratory
under conditions representative of Mode 3 or 4 conditions. We believe this off site test will result in safer plant
conditions than the in situ test proposed in the generic letter. The remaining changes to Technical Specification
3.4.3 incorporate the guidance contained in GL 90&hyph;06 and do not significantly increase the probability or consequence
of an LTOP event or the failure of the PORV to operate as required. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=73 g=1 f=1 -->
Cold Overpressurization Protection 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
Changes are being proposed to Technical Specification sections 3.1.2.1, 3.1.2.3, 3.4.1.4, 3.4.2.1, 3.4.3, 3.4.9.1,
3.4.9.3, 3.5.3, 4.1.2.3, 4.4.1.4, 4.4.3.1, 4.4.3.2, 4.4.9.3.1, 4.4.9.3.2, and 4.5.3.2 to incorporate the guidance
of GL 90&hyph;06 as well as enhance the availability of equipment to reduce the shutdown risk while still satisfying
the cold overpressure requirements. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed changes to Technical Specifications 3.1.2.1 and 3.1.2.3 will ensure only one charging pump and one HPSI
pump are operable in Mode 5 or 6 with the reactor vessel head on with an available vent of less than 2.8 square inches.
The remaining pumps will be secured. These proposed changes have been made to ensure Millstone Unit No. 2 does not create
an LTOP condition by the operation of too many pumps injecting fluid, thereby increasing pressure in a low-temperature
condition. These proposed modifications are consistent with Technical Specification 3.5.3 which has also been
modified and will decrease the possibility of an LTOP condition from occurring. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed change to Technical Specification 3.4.2.1 will ensure consistency between this technical specification
and Technical Specification 3.4.9.3. The safety valves at Millstone Unit No. 2 are not used for LTOP mitigation. The
PORVs, or RCS [reactor coolant system] vent at Millstone Unit No. 2 are used to mitigate an LTOP condition. Safety valves
are required to be operable during operating conditions to automatically reduce system pressures. The use of the
PORV, which allows manual control, for mitigation of an LTOP event, reduces the severity and consequence of a potential
overpressure event by giving the operators more control. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed changes to Technical Specification 3/4.9.3 provide enhanced operational flexibility through the
use of a PORV or RCS vent. The APPLICABILITY statement has been changed for clarification purposes with no change in
intent and safety implications. The ACTION requirements for the LTOP system include a 7-day allowable outage time
(AOT) to restore an inoperable LTOP channel to operable status before other remedial measures would have to be taken.
In addition, new Action Statement `f' states that the provisions of Specification 3.0.4 are not applicable. Therefore,
the unit may enter the Modes for which the LCO apply, during a unit shutdown or placement of the head on the reactor vessel
following refueling, when an LTOP channel is inoperable. In this situation, the 7-day AOT applies for restoring the
channel to operable status before other remedial measures would have to be taken. This is the same manner in which the
ACTION requirements apply when an LTOP channel is determined to be inoperable while the plant is in a Mode for which
the LTOP system is required to be operable. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Specifications 3.4.1.4 and 3.4.9.1 have been revised to address concerns identified in an NRC Information Notice
regarding previously unconsidered pressure drops across the reactor. The modifications to these two technical
specifications will ensure that unanticipated pressure rises do not occur and that there will be no increase in the
probability or consequences of the LTOP event. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Based on the evaluation done in support of resolution to GL 90&hyph;06 regarding the LTOP system unavailability,
NNECO concludes that additional restrictions on operation with an inoperable LTOP channel are warranted when the
potential for a low-temperature overpressure event is the highest, and especially when the unit is in a water-solid
condition. It is also concluded that these additional measures emphasize the importance of the LTOP system, especially
while operating in a water-solid condition as the primary success path for the mitigation of overpressure transients
during low-temperature operation. Therefore, these enhancements will not involve a significant increase in the
probability or consequence of an accident previously evaluated.

Boron Dilution 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
Changes are being proposed to Technical Specifications 3.1.1.3, 3.1.2.2, 3.1.2.3, 3.1.2.4, 3.1.2.8, 4.1.1.3,
4.1.2.3, and 4.1.2.4 to provide added assurance that the boron dilution analysis remains bounding while allowing
lower flow rates to reduce the potential of a loss of shutdown cooling due to vortexing at mid-loop operation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The changes to Technical Specifications 3.1.1.3, 3.1.2.2, 3.1.2.3, 3.1.2.4, 3.1.2.8, 4.1.1.3, 4.1.2.3, 4.1.2.4,
and 4.9.8.1 will not significantly increase the probability or consequences of an accident. Tagging out of a charging
pump, increasing shutdown margin, and reducing SDC flow will impact results of the boron dilution accident, but will
not increase the probability of initiating events. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
An increase in the shutdown margin requirement as was done in Technical Specifications 3.1.2.2 and 3.1.2.8 will assure
consistency with the Core Operating Limits Report which provided additional margin in a boron dilution event.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=73 g=1 f=1 -->
Shutdown Risk 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
The changes proposed to Technical Specifications 3.1.1.3, 3.1.2.1, 3.1.2.3, 3.5.3, 4.1.1.3, 4.1.2.3, 4.5.3.2
and 4.9.8.1 have been optimized to take into account shutdown risk concerns. Lower shutdown cooling flow rates are
allowed to minimize the potential of a loss of shutdown cooling due to vortexing during RCS mid-loop operation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The availability of injection sources in the shutdown modes have been optimized while still meeting the cold overpressurization
requirements. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
To address shutdown risk issues, the method to secure an inoperable HPSI pump has been modified. Previously, disconnecting
the motor circuit breaker from its electrical power circuit was the only acceptable method of isolating this pump.
Additional methods of isolating the pump have been added with the key locking of a discharge valve downstream of the
HPSI pump and the tagging the valve. These actions from the control room will allow the operator the ability to quickly
restore water flow and reduce the risk associated with having equipment out of service while shutdown. Inadvertent
actuation is prevented by requiring the operator to obtain the key to open this discharge valve from the shift supervisor.
The opening of this valve would, therefore, require the actions of two knowledgeable individuals, the operator,
and the shift supervisor. The limitation on the amount of pumps available is as a direct result of LTOP concerns. This
provides assurance that the LTOP requirements are met while maintaining the maximum available equipment to mitigate
shutdown risk concerns. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. Create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any previously analyzed. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed changes to Technical Specifications 3.1.1.3, 3.1.2.1, 3.1.2.2, 3.1.2.4, 3.1.2.8, 3.4.1.4, 3.4.2.1,
3.4.9.1, 4.1.1.3, 4.1.2.4, and 4.9.8.1 do not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any
previously analyzed. The proposed changes provide clarification or additional restrictions for plant personnel
concerning the operation of charging pumps, HPSI pumps, PORVs, blocking valves, and the SDC, boron dilution, and
LTOP systems. The proposed technical specification changes do not introduce significant changes in the manner in
which the plant is being operated. Therefore, no new failure modes are being introduced, and the potential for an unanalyzed
accident is not created. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed changes to Technical Specifications 3.4.3 do not create the possibility of an accident of a different
type than previously evaluated, since there is no change to the design of the plant. In addition, plant operations
are only being altered enough to allow a block valve and PORV to be placed in conditions which allow them to better perform
their safety functions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed changes to Technical Specification 3.4.9.3 do not create the possibility of an accident of a different
type than previously evaluated, since there is no change to the design of the plant and the way the plant is operated.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed changes to Technical Specification 3.1.2.3 and 3.5.3 allow for the isolation of an inoperable HPSI pump
by the key lock closing of a valve at the discharge of the HPSI pump and the safety tagging in the closed position. This
isolation is required so that a LTOP condition does not occur. This method of isolation is required so that a LTOP condition
does not occur. This method of isolation is acceptable and will not create a new or different kind of accident since
it is not possible to inadvertently open this valve. A deliberate action is required by the operator, with the concurrence
of the shift supervisor, to obtain the key and open the valve. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. Involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed changes will not have an adverse impact on the protection boundaries. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
With regard to the GL 90&hyph;06 modifications, there is no degradation in the operability and surveillance requirements
for the PORVs and block valves and the LTOP systems. There will be no change in actual practice for, or resulting performance
of, these systems. All other changes are proposed mainly to clarify each requirement. For Modes 1, 2, and 3, safety-related
overpressure protection is provided by the pressurizer code safety relief valves. Therefore, there will be no adverse
impact on the margin of safety as defined in the bases of any technical specification. Although any two charging pumps
are allowed to be operable in a shutdown condition, the flow of these pumps is consistent with the assumptions of the
boron dilution analysis. Additional pumping capability is being provided to address shutdown risk concerns, however,
the limitation on pumping is tied to the vent path that is available. This will ensure that the margin of safety is not
impacted. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The combined effects of reducing SDC flow, tagging out a charging pump, and increasing shutdown margin is that the
required operator response times of 15 minutes in Modes 4 and 5, and 30 minutes in Mode 6 are maintained. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
By reducing the allowed SDC flow rate to less than that where vortexing can occur, the potential for a loss of SDC event
is being reduced. Therefore, there is no decrease in the margin of safety for the boron dilution and shutdown cooling
events. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed changes associated with the cold overpressure mitigation system will ensure the appropriate margin
of safety is maintained by limiting RCP operation in Mode 5 and limit RCS cooldown rates. These actions will ensure
an LTOP condition does not occur.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
I. This proposal does not involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously
evaluated. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed Technical Specification changes to delete prescribed audit frequencies and remove the Emergency Plan
and Security Plan from Technical Specifications are administrative in nature and neither directly increase or decrease
the likelihood that an accident will occur. The Technical Specification changes will not impact the function or method
of operation of plant systems, structures, or components. Thus, the consequences of a malfunction of equipment important
to safety previously evaluated in the FSAR is not increased by the changes. Therefore, it is concluded that the proposed
changes do not increase the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

III. This change does not involve a significant reduction in a margin

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed Technical Specification changes to delete prescribed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
audit frequencies and remove the Emergency Plan and Security Plan 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
from Technical Specifications do not involve any reductions in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the margin of safety. The proposed changes will enable more 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
effective resource utilization through performance based 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
scheduling of audits in the affected areas. Using performance 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
indicators and other measures of program effectiveness, potential 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
problems can be more readily identified and audit resources can 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
be applied to these areas to enhance performance. The proposed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
performance based audit process will maintain or enhance the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
margin of safety in the areas audited.

Description of amendment request: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposed modification to Technical Specification (TS) Section 4.8.4.3.a, would increase the surveillance
interval for the functional test of the Reactor Protection System (RPS). The increase would be from every six (6) months
to each time the plant is in cold shutdown for a period of 24 hours, unless the test was performed in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the previous six months. This change is based on guidance provided in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Generic Letter 91&hyph;09, ``Modification Of Surveillance Interval For The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Electrical Protective Assemblies In Power Supplies For The Reactor 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Protection System.''

Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee has provided its analysis of the issue of no significant hazards consideration,
which is presented below:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
1. The proposed Technical Specification changes do not involve a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
significant increase in the probability or consequences of an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
accident previously evaluated. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Reactor Protection System equipment subject to the proposed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Technical Specifications changes are not accident initiators. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Electrical Protective Assemblies (EPAs) specified by these 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proposed changes are not required to actuate in order to mitigate 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
an accident. The functional test methodology of the RPS 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
electrical power monitoring channels will not be effected by the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proposed change in test frequency. The design and function of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the EPAs will not be altered and will perform as originally 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
designed. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A review of the RPS electrical power monitoring relays 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
surveillance test history results was performed and supports the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proposed TS changes to extend the testing interval. Fifty-one 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(51) surveillance tests were reviewed, and all the as-found 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
channel calibration results were within the required TS limits. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
There were identified deficiencies in four (4) of the fifty-one 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
tests performed, however, these four deficiencies did not affect 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the operability of the RPS EPAs. Based on good historical 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
surveillance test results, we have concluded that the reliability 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of the equipment is not expected to degrade during the proposed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
extended test interval. Furthermore, the proposed reduced 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
testing will result in a net decrease in the probability of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
occurrence of a malfunction of equipment important to safety. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
These malfunctions would cause an invalid inadvertent trip of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
RPS which would impose unnecessary challenges on the affected 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
unit at power. The guidance set forth in Generic Letter 91&hyph;09 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
states ``The staff concludes that the benefit to safety of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reducing the frequency of testing during power operations more 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
than offsets the risk to safety from relaxing the surveillance 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requirement to test the EPAs during power operation.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Since the RPS EPAs are not accident initiators, and the design 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and function of the equipment will not be affected by the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proposed TS changes, and the reliability of the equipment is not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
expected to degrade during the extended test interval, and the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
changes would reduce the probability of unnecessary challenges to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the affected unit, we have concluded that the proposed changes do 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
not involve a significant increase in the probability or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
consequences of an accident previously evaluated. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. The proposed TS changes do not create the possibility of a new or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The design and function of the RPS EPAs will not be affected by 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the proposed TS changes. The failure modes of the existing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
equipment will remain unchanged, and no new accident types will 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
be created. The RPS electrical power monitoring channels' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
functional test methodology will not be affected by the proposed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
change in test frequency. Therefore, the proposed TS changes do 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
from any accident previously evaluated. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. The proposed TS changes do not involve a significant reduction in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a margin of safety. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Based on a review of the RPS electrical power monitoring relays 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
surveillance test history results we have concluded that the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reliability of the equipment is not expected to degrade during 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the proposed extended test interval. In addition, the benefit to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
safety by reducing the frequency of testing during power 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
operation and the attendant possible challenges to safety systems 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
more than offsets any risk to safety from relaxing the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
surveillance requirements to test the EPAs during power 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
operation. Therefore, the proposed TS changes do not involve a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
significant reduction in a margin of safety.

Technical Specifications, Section 5.5.3, ``Capacity,'' to permit an interim

As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee has provided its analysis of the issue of no significant hazards consideration,
which is presented below:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
1. The proposed Technical Specifications (TS) change does not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of an accident previously evaluated. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Increasing the spent fuel storage capacity in the Unit 1 Spent 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Fuel Pool (SFP) from 2040 fuel assemblies to 2500 fuel assemblies 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
does not increase the probability of occurrence of an accident. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Since all fuel handling activities will be performed using 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
approved procedures and compatible equipment, the probability of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a fuel handling accident occurring is unchanged. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Increasing the spent fuel storage capacity in the Unit 1 SFP to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2500 fuel assemblies will facilitate storing 1940 spent fuel 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
assemblies (including contingency) that have been discharged from 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
LGS, Units 1 and 2, and 560 low exposure fuel assemblies shipped 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to LGS from the Shoreham Nuclear Power Station. The decay heat 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
load associated with the entire Shoreham fuel inventory is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
insignificant, since it equates to less than 5% of the heat load 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
generated from one (1) recently discharged full power fuel 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
bundle. Therefore, the actual decay heat load to the Unit 1 SFP 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
will be equivalent to that which is generated from storing the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1940 spent fuel assemblies discharged from LGS, Units 1 and 2. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Increasing the spent fuel storage capacity in the Unit 1 SFP to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
accommodate the storage of 2500 fuel assemblies, as proposed in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
this TS Change Request, is bounded by the existing analysis 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
supporting the storage of spent fuel at LGS. The existing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
analysis considers design inputs for structural integrity, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
criticality, and thermal-hydraulics and is based on the storage 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of 2862 spent fuel assemblies. As documented in Section 9.1.3, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
``Spent Fuel Pool Cooling and Cleanup Systems,'' of Supplement 2 of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the NRC's Safety Evaluation Report, i.e., NUREG&hyph;0991, ``Safety 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Evaluation Report Related to the Operation of Limerick Generating 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Station, Units 1 and 2,'' the NRC indicated that based on its 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
independent analysis the heat removal capability of the Fuel Pool 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Cooling and Cleanup (FPCC) system could only support 2484 spent 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
fuel assemblies. However, the LGS, Unit 1 TS currently limit the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
storage of spent fuel to 2040 spent fuel assemblies. Since the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
decay heat load from the Shoreham fuel inventory (i.e., 560 fuel 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
assemblies) is insignificant, the actual heat load to the Unit 1 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
SFP will be equivalent to that generated from 1940 fuel 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
assemblies discharged from LGS, Units 1 and 2, which is less than 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the limit currently specified [in] the TS (i.e., 2040 fuel 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
assemblies). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Relocating six (6) of the existing Unit 2 spent fuel storage 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
racks to the Unit 1 SFP will be conducted in accordance with PECO 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Energy's Heavy Loads Program which was developed in order to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
implement the guidance delineated in NUREG&hyph;0612, ``Control of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Heavy Loads at Nuclear Power Plants,'' such that the likelihood of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a heavy load drop is precluded. The Unit 2 spent fuel storage 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
racks are identical to those already in use in the Unit 1 SFP. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Procedures will be in place to ensure that the Unit 2 spent fuel 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
storage racks are situated in the Unit 1 SFP to insure [ensure] 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proper neutron poison alignment with the existing Unit 1 racks. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The existing spent fuel storage racks are designed for rack-to-rack contact during design basis events without the
loss of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
structural integrity. The racks are also designed to withstand 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the impact from a dropped fuel assembly without the loss of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
structural integrity or be damaged in a way that could adversely 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
affect the criticality analysis. Increasing the spent fuel 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
storage capacity to accommodate the storage of 2500 spent fuel 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
assemblies will not affect the spent fuel storage racks since the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
racks are specifically designed to safely store spent fuel. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This proposed TS change will not prevent the ability of the FPCC 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
system from performing its design function to adequately cool the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
SFP. The FPCC system will continue to function normally and be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
capable of maintaining the SFP temperature at or below 140 
<!-- PJG 0040 degreeslatlong -->
&cir;F. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The backup cooling and makeup systems (i.e., Residual Heat 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Removal (RHR), Emergency Service Water (ESW), and Residual Heat 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Removal Service Water (RHRSW) systems) will continue to function 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
as designed to provide an alternate source of cooling and makeup 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
water to ensure SFP cooling is maintained. The RHR system is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
still capable of maintaining the SFP temperature less than 140 
<!-- PJG 0040 degreeslatlong -->
&cir;F 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
as described in LGS Updated Final Safety Analysis Report (UFSAR). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Increasing the spent fuel storage capacity in the Unit 1 SFP will 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
not increase the probability of a loss of fuel pool cooling 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
accident or adversely affect the Refuel Floor ventilation system. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The consequences of a Fuel Handling Accident as described in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
LGS UFSAR are not increased since the number of fuel assemblies 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
stored in a SFP is not an input to the initial conditions of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
accident evaluation. This accident evaluates the dropping of a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
spent fuel assembly and the fuel grapple assembly into the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reactor core during refueling operations. A drop height of 32 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
feet for the spent fuel assembly and 47 feet for the fuel grapple 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
assembly are assumed and will produce the largest number of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
failed fuel rods. Since the maximum possible height a fuel 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
assembly can be dropped over the SFP does not exceed 32 feet, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
consequences of a Fuel Handling Accident will not be increased by 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
increasing the number of fuel storage cells. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The consequences of a loss of fuel pool cooling as described in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 9.1.3.6 of the LGS UFSAR will not be increased. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
event described in the UFSAR assumes that the iodine in the fuel 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
from past refuelings is negligible, due to the long decay time. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Iodine is the major contributor to thyroid dose. Since the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
iodine in the fuel from past refuelings is negligible, due to the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
long decay time, increasing the spent fuel storage capacity will 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
not increase the dose due to the release of iodine in the SFP 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
water resulting from boiling and therefore, the consequences are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
not increased.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
Increasing the storage capacity in the Unit 1 SFP, on an interim basis, will not increase the probability of a malfunction
of the stored spent fuel since the existing thermal-hydraulic analysis confirms that sufficient cooling capability
exists to accommodate the storage of 2500 fuel assemblies in the Unit 1 SFP. As for fuel criticality, the existing analysis
also confirms that the stored fuel assemblies will remain sub-critical under normal and abnormal conditions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Increasing the storage capacity in the Unit 1 SFP will not increase the probability of a malfunction of the SFP structure
or SFP liner. The existing structural analysis confirms that the SFP structure has adequate margin to prevent overstressing
and meets the code requirements. Increasing the storage capacity in the Unit 1 SFP will not increase the probability
of a malfunction of the spent fuel storage racks during design basis events based on the existing seismic/structural
analysis. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Increasing the on-site spent fuel storage capacity will not increase the probability of a malfunction of the FPCC
system. The FPCC system will continue to function as designed. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The probability of a malfunction of fuel handling equipment will not be increased since increasing the storage capacity
in the Unit 1 SFP, as proposed, does not affect fuel handling equipment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Increasing the spent fuel storage capacity does not increase the consequences of a spent fuel assembly failure since
the failure of one (1) assembly will not result in additional spent fuel assembly failures. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Increasing the spent fuel storage capacity will not increase the consequences of spent fuel storage rack failure,
since the existing racks have been designed/qualified to limit the consequences of a failure. A failure of, or damage
to one (1) storage rack, will not result in failure or damage to another storage rack. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Increasing the spent fuel storage capacity will not increase the consequences of the failure of fuel handling equipment
since the maximum expected number of fuel rods damaged by a fuel handling equipment failure remains as evaluated in
the LGS UFSAR. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Therefore, the proposed TS change does not involve an increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously
evaluated. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. The proposed TS change does not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously
evaluated. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Increasing the spent fuel storage capacity in the LGS Unit 1 SFP to permit an interim increase from 2040 fuel assemblies
to 2500 fuel assemblies will not create the possibility of an accident of a different type. The Unit 1 SFP has been analyzed
for criticality effects, structural effects, radiological effects, and thermal-hydraulic effects. The increase
in spent fuel storage capacity will be achieved by relocating six (6) existing spent fuel storage racks from the Unit
2 SFP to the Unit 1 SFP. The spent fuel storage racks are of identical design and are passive components; therefore,
the possibility of creating a new accident does not exist. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
No new operating schemes or active equipment types will be required to store additional fuel bundles in the SFP. Therefore,
the possibility of a different type of malfunction occurring is not created. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Therefore, the proposed TS change does not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any previously
evaluated. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. The proposed TS change does not involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety.

1. The proposed changes do not involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously
evaluated because the proposed changes do not alter the operation of equipment assumed to be an initiator of any analyzed
event or assumed to be available for the mitigation of accidents or transients. Proposed changes 1 and 2 are administrative
in nature. Proposed change 3 to reduce the requirement to verify insertion capability from every 24 hours to a single
verification when one or more control rods are stuck is sufficient to verify that the problem is not generic while providing
the benefit of removing a very resource intensive requirement and permits licensed operators to focus on other, more
safety significant actions. Proposed change 4 will continue to provide the necessary assurance that replacement
charges on the explosive valve of the standby liquid control system will be from a batch from which a sample charge has
been tested satisfactorily. Proposed change 5 modifies the allowable interval between surveillance tests for the
standby liquid control system without reducing the reliability of the system while providing the benefit of reduced
wear and tear on the system. Therefore, these proposed changes do not increase the probability or consequences of
an accident previously evaluated. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. The proposed changes do not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously
evaluated because implementation of the proposed changes do not involve any physical changes to plant systems, structures,
or components. The proposed changes do not allow plant operation in any mode that is not already evaluated. Therefore,
the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated is not created. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. The proposed changes do not involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety because the proposed changes do
not affect the manner in which the facility is operated or change equipment or features which affect the operational
characteristics of the facility. Proposed changes 1 and 2 are administrative in nature. Proposed change 3 maintains
the assurance that when a scram is required that, at a minimum, the assumptions used in the accident analysis will be
met. Additionally, if the initial check of control rod insertion is satisfactory, the subsequent checks are not likely
to identify similar problems because operating experience shows that a [stuck] rod is rare. Once it has been determined
that the same problem is not occurring in other control rods the normal surveillance frequency is sufficient to verify
that scram capability is maintained. Proposed change 4 provides added flexibility for providing replacement [charges]
from any batch that has had a charge successfully fired. Proposed change 4 adds flexibility while maintaining the
firing reliability in excess of 99.99% for the explosive valves on the standby liquid control system. Proposed change
5 does not impact any safety analysis assumptions because the frequency of testing is not assumed in any safety analysis
and standby liquid control system operability is maintained. In addition, the test frequency reduction provides
reduced wear and tear on the system and increased system reliability. Therefore, the proposed changes do not involve
a significant reduction in a margin of safety.

Description of amendment request: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This application for an amendment to the James A. FitzPatrick Technical Specifications proposes new Safety/Relief
Valve (SRV) performance limits to take credit for the currently installed SRV capacity. Specifically, three changes
to the existing SRV performance limits are proposed: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;The first permits continued plant operation with two SRVs out-ofservice. Since 7 of the 11 SRVs at FitzPatrick
are also automatic depressurization system (ADS) valves, this reduces the number of ADS valves required to be operable
to 5. Current specifications permit only one SRV out-of-service for 30 days. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Secondly, the setpoints for all 11 SRVs are changed to a single nominal setpoint. Current specifications stagger
the setpoints from 1090 to 1140 psig. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;The third change increases the maximum permissible setpoint tolerance 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
from one to three percent. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The new Limiting Safety System Setting (LSSS) for reactor coolant system overpressurization protection (TS 2.2.1.B),
as a result of these changes, now requires that 9 of 11 SRVs be operable at a common setpoint of 1110 psig plus or minus
3 percent. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Safety analyses were performed, using a conservative SRV setpoint of 1195 psig, which demonstrate that these proposed
changes are acceptable. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Other changes, not associated with SRV performance, clarify selected portions of the Technical Specifications
and correct minor typographical and editorial errors. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This ``Notice of Consideration of Issuance of Amendment to Facility Operating License and Opportunity for Hearing''
(Notice) supersedes the related Notice which was published in the

Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee has provided its analysis of the issue of no significant hazards consideration,
which is presented below: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Operation of the James A. FitzPatrick Nuclear Power Plant in accordance with the proposed amendment would not involve
a significant hazards consideration as defined in 10 CFR 50.92, since it would not: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
1. Involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated. A bounding
analysis (NEDC&hyph;31697P, ``Updated SRV Performance Requirements for the James A. FitzPatrick Nuclear Power
Plant'') of the revised SRV performance requirements considered plant operation with 9 of 11 SRVs operable and with
a common valve actuation pressure of 1195 psig. The analysis demonstrates that a 50 psi margin exists between the maximum
anticipated pressure and the American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME) Code upset reactor vessel pressure
limit of 1375 psig. The analyses of NEDC&hyph;31697P also demonstrate that the new SRV performance limits have no
significant impact on thermal limits, ECCS/LOCA performance, HPCI/RCIC operability, containment response, containment
integrity, or 10 CFR [Part] 50 Appendix R alternate shutdown capability. The analyses also considered simmer margin
and downward setpoint drift.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The five miscellaneous changes clarify terminology, correct typographical errors, remove a surveillance requirement
which should have been deleted as part of Amendment 130, clarify when SRV manual actuation is performed, and delete
a duplicate specification. These changes are purely administrative in nature and, as such, do not impact previously
evaluated accidents or equipment malfunctions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. Ccreate the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from those previously evaluated. The new SRV performance
limits are primarily administrative changes. The only physical changes involve recalibration of SRV setpoints
and operation with 2 SRVs/ADS valves out-of-service. The operation and function of the pressure relief system and
[are] unaffected. No new failure modes are introduced. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed miscellaneous changes are purely administrative in nature and, as such, do not create the possibility
of an accident or malfunction. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. Involve a significant reduction in the margin of safety. The new SRV performance limits slightly reduce the existing
margin to vessel overpressure and the margin to the 125% mechanical overspeed trip for the HPCI and RCIC turbines.
However, the reduction in the overpressure margin is insignificant (approximately 25 psi) and the plant's response
to transients and accidents remains well within the limits established in General Design Criteria (GDC) 15, Standard
Review Plan Section 5.2.2, and FSAR Section 4.4. The reduction in turbine overspeed margin is negligible (less than
1%), because it is within the allowable tolerance of the trip settings. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed miscellaneous changes are purely administrative in nature and do not involve a reduction in safety margin.

Description of amendment request: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposed amendment would relocate the fire protection requirements of Technical Specifications (TSs) 3.14
and 4.12, and fire brigade staffing and training requirements of TSs 6.2.2(f) and 6.4.2 from the TSs to administratively-controlled
operational specifications. Specifically, the proposed changes would add the NRC standard fire protection license
condition to the Operating License, update the Final Safety Analysis Report (FSAR) to include the Fire Protection
Program by reference, and relocate the fire protection requirements from the TSs to the Indian Point 3 Operational
Specifications Manual. The proposed changes have been developed in accordance with the guidance contained in NRC
Generic Letter (GL) 86&hyph;10, ``Implementation of Fire Protection Requirements,'' and GL 88&hyph;12, ``Removal
of Fire Protection Requirements from the Technical Specifications.''

As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee has provided its analysis of the issue of no significant hazards consideration,
which is presented below: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Consistent with the criteria of 10 CFR 50.92, the enclosed application is judged to involve no significant hazards
based on the following information: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
(1) Does the proposed license amendment involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of any
accident previously evaluated? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=71 g=1 f=1 -->
Response
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
This change does not involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously
evaluated. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This proposed amendment merely relocates the fire protection program elements from the Technical Specifications
to the Operational Specifications and the FSAR [Final Safety Analysis Report]. No reduction in content is being made
to the Technical Specification requirements that are being relocated. Operating limitations will continue to be
imposed, and required surveillances will continue to be performed in accordance with written procedures and instructions
auditable by the NRC.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Although future proposed changes to the fire protection program elements previously located in the Technical Specifications
will no longer be controlled by 10 CFR 50.90, proposed changes to the Fire Protection requirements relocated to the
Operational Specifications will be evaluated by plant administrative procedures. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Thus, programmatic controls will continue to assure that future proposed fire protection program changes will not
create an unreviewed safety question. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Does the proposed license amendment create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any previously
evaluated? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=71 g=1 f=1 -->
Response
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
The possibility of an accident or malfunction of a different type than evaluated previously in the safety analysis
report is not created. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This proposed amendment merely relocates the fire protection Technical Specification requirements from the Technical
Specifications to the Operational Specifications. No reduction to the fire protection Technical Specification
requirements is being made and thus the change does not create the possibility of a new or different accident from those
previously evaluated. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As noted above, future changes to the requirements in the Operational Specifications will be evaluated by plant administrative
procedures. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Does the proposed amendment involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=71 g=1 f=1 -->
Response: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
The margin of safety as defined in the bases for any technical specification is not reduced. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This proposed amendment does not involve a reduction to the approved fire protection program or Fire Protection Technical
Specification requirements. The Technical Specification fire protection requirements are being relocated, with
no reduction in content, to the Operational Specifications. Since there is no reduction in the requirements, there
is no reduction in the margin of safety. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As noted above, proposed changes to the Fire Protection Technical Specification requirements relocated to the Operational
Specifications will be evaluated by plant administrative procedures.

Description of amendment request:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 This amendment request would revise the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Emergency Diesel Generator hot restart test by separating it from the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
24-hour endurance run and from the load sequence testing. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 As 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee has provided its analysis of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
issue of no significant hazards consideration, which is presented below:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
(1) Do not involve a significant increase in the probability or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
consequences of an accident previously analyzed. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed changes would revise the Salem Emergency Diesel 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Generator (EDG) surveillance criteria to allow the hot restart 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
test to be performed independent of the Engineered Safety 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Features (ESF) load sequencing test and the 24-hour endurance 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
run. The proposed surveillance requirements would continue to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
demonstrate that the objectives of each of these tests are met. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Specifically, the EDG's are shown to be capable of starting the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ESF loads in the required sequence, operating at full load for an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
extended period of time, and restarting from a full load 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
temperature condition. Therefore, the proposed changes would not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
adversely affect the EDG's ability to support mitigation of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
consequences of any previously evaluated accident. The proposed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
changes to the surveillance requirements do not affect the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
initiation or progression of any accident sequence. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Do not create the possibility of a new or different kind of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
accident from any accident previously evaluated. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed change affects surveillance test criteria such that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
increased scheduling flexibility is allowed while the test 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
objectives associated with demonstrating EDG operability continue 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to be met. The proposed changes do not allow any plant 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
configurations that are presently prohibited by the Salem 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Technical Specifications. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Do not involve a significant reduction in a margin of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
safety. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Surveillance testing per the proposed Technical 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Specifications would continue to demonstrate the ability of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the EDG's to perform their intended function of providing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
electrical power to ESF systems needed to mitigate design 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
basis transients, consistent with the plant safety analyses. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The margin of safety demonstrated by the plant safety 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
analyses is therefore not affected by the proposed change. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Therefore, [Public Service Electric and Gas Company] PSE&amp;G has 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
concluded that the changes proposed herein do not involve a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Significant Hazards Consideration.

Description of amendment request:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The proposed amendment will revise 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Sections 2.C and 2.D of the San Onofre Nuclear Generating Station, Unit 1 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(SONGS 1) Operating License. Section 2.C will be revised to modify or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
delete several licensing conditions which either no longer apply or require 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
revision to apply to SONGS 1 in its permanently shutdown and defueled 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
condition. Section 2.D will be revised to exempt Fire Protection reporting 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
from the reporting requirements of Section 2.D. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 As 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee has provided its analysis of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
issue of no significant hazards consideration, which is presented below:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
1. Will operation of the facility according to this proposed change 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of an accident previously evaluated? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
No. SONGS 1 has been permanently shut down and all fuel has been 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
taken out of the reactor and stored in the SONGS 1 spent fuel 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
pool. The proposed change will not modify any of the existing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
plant configurations, controls, procedures, or technical 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
specification requirements necessary to assure the integrity and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
safe operation of the spent fuel pool. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The technical basis for deleting the four license conditions, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
which relate to Integrated Implementation Schedule, Cycle 11 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Thermal Shield Monitoring Program, Plant Modification to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Eliminate Single Failure Susceptibility of Vital Bus Automatic 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Transfer Function, and the NRC's Confirmatory Order of January 2, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1990, is that these license conditions were intended to assure 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the continued safe operation of SONGS 1 as a power producing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
plant. With the permanent shutdown of SONGS 1 and the issuance 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of its Permanently Defueled Technical Specifications (PDTS) on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
December 28, 1993, the plant modifications and safety programs 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
associated with the four license conditions are no longer 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
necessary. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The technical basis for modifying the license condition on fuel 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
transshipment is that this license condition was intended to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ensure the safety of the operating plant by putting restrictions 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
on operation of the turbine building gantry crane. These 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
restrictions are no longer necessary, in light of the permanent 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
shutdown of SONGS 1. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The technical basis for modifying the license condition on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
physical protection is that this is necessary to update the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
information contained in the license condition. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The technical basis for exempting the Fire Protection Program 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
from the reporting requirements of Section 2.D is that the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
applicable requirements are adequately covered in 10 CFR 50.72 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and 50.73, as stated in Generic Letters 86&hyph;10 and 88&hyph;12. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. Will operation of the facility according to this proposed change 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
from any accident previously evaluated? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
No. No safety-related equipment will be impacted by this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proposed change. Thus, there is no credible likelihood that a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
new or different kind of accident from any accident previously 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
evaluated would occur as a result of this proposed change. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. Will operation of the facility according to this proposed change 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
No. As explained earlier, the plant modifications and safety 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
programs associated with the license conditions being deleted are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
no longer necessary. The safety-related equipment concerns that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
led to restrictions on operation of the turbine building gantry 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
crane no longer exist. The modification to the license condition 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
on physical protection will update the information contained in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
this license condition. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The revision to Section 2.D will make the reporting requirements 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
regarding deficiencies in the Fire Protection Program consistent 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
with the NRC's generic guidance on this subject. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Thus operation of the facility in accordance with this proposed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
change will not significantly reduce a margin of safety.

Description of amendment request
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
: The proposed amendment would revise the BFN Units 1, 2, and 3 Technical Specifications (TS) by providing an alternate
visual inspection schedule for safety-related snubbers. The licensee has stated that the amendment follows the
recommendations of NRC Generic Letter (GL) 90&hyph;09, ``Alternative Requirements for Snubber Visual Inspection
Intervals and Corrective Actions'' dated December 11, 1990. GL 90&hyph;09 describes a TS line item improvement acceptable
to the NRC staff. The purpose of the line item improvement is to provide a means for reducing resource demands and unnecessary
occupational radiological exposure attributable to snubber inspections while continuing to provide an acceptable
level of confidence in snubber operability.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee has provided its analysis of the issue of no significant hazards consideration,
which is presented below:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
1. The proposed amendment does not involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident
previously evaluated. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Implementing the guidance specified in GL 90&hyph;09 will not introduce any new failure mode and will not alter any
assumptions previously made in evaluating the consequences of an accident. The proposed alternate schedule for
visual inspections will maintain the same operability confidence level as the existing schedule. Also, the surveillance
requirement and schedule for snubber functional testing remains the same providing a 95 percent confidence level
that 90 percent to 100 percent of the snubbers operate within the specified acceptance limits. The proposed visual
inspection schedule is separate from functional testing and provides additional confidence that the installed
snubbers will serve their design function and are being maintained operable. The proposed changes do not affect limiting
safety system settings or operating parameters, and do not modify or add any accident initiating events or parameters.
Therefore, the proposed change does not significantly increase the probability or consequences of an accident previously
evaluated. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. The proposed amendment does not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously
evaluated. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Implementing the recommendations specified in GL 90&hyph;09 does not involve any physical alterations to plant
equipment, changes to setpoints or operating parameters, nor does it involve any potential accident initiating
event. As stated in the generic letter, the alternate schedule for snubber visual inspections maintains the same
confidence level as the existing schedule. Additionally, functional testing of snubbers provides a 95 percent confidence
level that 90 percent to 100 percent of the snubbers operate within specified acceptance limits. Since this TS change
does not physically alter the plant equipment and the snubber confidence level remains the same there will not be any
new or different accident resulting from snubber failure from any accident previously evaluated. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. The proposed amendment does not involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed change incorporates the surveillance requirements for snubber visual inspection intervals following
the guidance provided in GL 90&hyph;09. As stated in the generic letter, the proposed snubber visual inspection interval
maintains the same confidence level as the existing snubber visual inspection interval. This surveillance requirement
does not alter the current Limiting Condition for Operation or the accompanying actions for the snubber(s). The requirement
for functional testing of safety-related snubbers is unchanged and remains the basis for the established margin
of safety and assures a 95 percent confidence level that 90 percent to 100 percent of the snubbers operate within the
specified acceptance limits. This functional testing along with the proposed visual inspection intervals provides
adequate assurance that the snubber will perform its intended function. Therefore, the proposed changes do not involve
a significant reduction in a margin of safety.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The proposed amendment would revise the TS 3/4.1.1.1 (Reactivity Control Systems_Boration Control Systems_

(ECCS_Borated Water Storage Tank), Bases 3/4.5 (ECCS), and TS 3/4.10.4 (Special Test Exceptions_Shutdown Margin).
This amendment would: (a) Increase the required boration flowrate in the event the required shutdown margin is not
met, (b) increase the applicable minimum boron concentration and/or volume requirements, (c) revise the applicable
Action statements and Surveillance Requirements, and (d) propose several administrative and editorial changes.

Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee has provided its analysis of the issue of no significant hazards consideration,
which is presented below, indicating that the proposed changes would: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
1a. Not involve a significance increase in the probability of an accident previously evaluated because no accident
initiators, conditions or assumptions are significantly affected by the proposed changes. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed changes would increase the required boration flowrate in the event the required SHUTDOWN MARGIN is not
met, increase the minimum required volume for the Boric Acid Addition System (BAAS) and increase the minimum required
boron concentration for the Borated Water Storage Tank (BWST) and the Core Flooding Tanks (CFT). The proposed changes
would also revise the Technical Specification (TS) Action Statements for the BWST and the CFT, revise the TS Surveillance
Requirement relating to boron concentration sampling of the CFT, and would revise the TS Surveillance Requirements
involving trisodium phosphate chemistry. In addition, various administrative and editorial changes, including
changes to the TS Bases, are proposed. As stated above, none of these proposed changes involve accident initiators,
conditions, or assumptions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1b. Not involve a significant increase in the consequences of an accident previously evaluated because no accident
conditions or assumptions are affected by the proposed changes. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed changes for the minimum required boron concentrations and volumes for the BAAS, BWST, and CPT comply
with existing requirements to maintain a 1% delta k/k shutdown margin (SDM) at all times, and are consistent with reload
and LOCA analysis. Therefore, the accident condition assumption of 1% delta k/k SDM at the initiation of an accident
will still be met and the radiological consequences will be as previously evaluated. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed changes do not alter the source term, containment isolation, or allowable releases. The proposed changes,
therefore, will not increase the radiological consequences of a previously evaluated accident. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2a. Not create the possibility of a new kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated because no new accident
initiators or assumptions are introduced by the proposed changes. As stated in 1a, the proposed changes do not affect
any accident initiators and are not initiators themselves. The proposed changes do not alter any accident scenarios.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2b. Not create the possibility of a different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated because the
proposed changes only affect existing components, systems, and functions and do not introduce any new requirements
that cannot be met with the existing components, systems, and functions. The proposed changes do not alter any accident
scenarios. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. Not involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety. The proposed changes to the minimum required boron concentration
and volumes for the BAAS, BWST, and CFT would ensure the margin of safety for reactor subcriticality is maintained
at all times for anticipated future core designs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed change to the TS Action statement to increase the required boration flowrate in the event the SHUTDOWN
MARGIN requirement is not met, would ensure that the boration rate is adequate for restoring the required SHUTDOWN
MARGIN for anticipated future core design. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed changes to the TS Action statements for the BWST and the CFT ensure that the plant is maneuvered in a timely
and conservative manner, without challenging any plant systems, while minimizing the time the plant would be exposed
to a LOCA with assumptions not being met. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed changes to the TS Surveillance Requirements associated with trisodium phosphate chemistry would clarify
the requirements, make it easier to perform testing, minimize radwaste generation, and reduce the consequences
of a potential radioactive spill. The proposed changes would also make the requirements consistent with the DBNPS
Updated Safety Analysis Report. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed change to the TS Surveillance Requirement associated with the boron concentration sampling of the CFT
would eliminate an unnecessary requirement and make the Surveillance Requirement consistent with NUREG&hyph;1430.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
None of these changes would adversely affect the margin of safety.

1a. Not involve a significant increase in the probability of an accident previously evaluated because no change is
being made to any accident initiator. The proposed changes are clarifications and the incorporations of either the
recommendations of Generic Letter 93&hyph;05 or the guidance provided by NUREG&hyph;1430. Therefore, it can be

The proposed change would revise the Technical Specifications (TS) for the North Anna Power Station, Units No. 1 and
No. 2 (NA&hyph;1&amp;2). Specifically, the proposed changes would modify the pressure/temperature operating
limitations during heatup and cooldown and the Low Temperature Overpressure Protection System (LTOPS) pressure
setpoints and temperatures for NA&hyph;1&amp;2. Also, the proposed changes include revised Limiting Conditions
for Operation, Action Statements, and Surveillance Requirements for the Power-Operated Relief Valves (PORVs)
and block valves to address the concerns discussed in NRC Generic Letter 90&hyph;06. Additionally, the proposed
changes include several editorial/administrative changes.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The NA&hyph;1&amp;2 Reactor Coolant Systems (RCS) are protected from material failure by the imposition of restrictions
on allowable pressure and temperature, and on heatup and cooldown rate. The LTOPS ensures that material integrity
limits are not exceeded during the design basis overpressurization accidents. Equipment operability requirements
are imposed to ensure that the assumptions of the accident analyses remain valid. The operating restrictions, setpoints,
and equipment operability requirements must be revised to extend their applicability to a higher cumulative burnup,
and to improve operational flexibility.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The current pressure/temperature operating limits and LTOPS setpoints are valid to 12 Effective Full-Power Years
(EFPY) and 17 EFPY for NA&hyph;1&amp;2, respectively. According to the most recent estimates, the burnup applicability
limits will be exceeded by NA&hyph;1 in the spring of 1996. The NA&hyph;2 pressure/temperature operating limits
and LTOPS setpoints remain valid well into the year 2002. The proposed NA&hyph;1 TS include revised pressure/temperature
operating limits valid to end-of-license. Although the NA&hyph;2 pressure/temperature operating limits are not
being changed, the NA&hyph;2 LTOPS setpoints and associated reactor vessel integrity protection philosophy are
being changed. The reactor vessel integrity protection philosophy which supports the proposed TS changes provides
improved operational flexibility while maintaining an adequate margin of safety as demonstrated by the safety analysis.

 As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee has provided its analysis of the issue of no significant hazards consideration,
which is presented below:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Specifically, operation of [North Anna] Power Station in accordance with the [proposed] Technical Specification
changes will not:

[1] involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated. The safety
analysis demonstrates that the proposed reactor vessel protection philosophy, and the associated pressure/temperature
limits, LTOPS setpoints, and component operability requirements, ensure that reactor vessel integrity will be
maintained during normaloperation and design basis accident conditions. Specifically, adherence to the heatup/cooldown
rate-dependent pressure/temperature operating limits ensures that the assumed design basis flaw will not propagate
during normal operation. Below the LTOPS enabling temperature, automatic actuation of the PORVs ensures that the
assumed design basis flaw will not propagate under design basis low-temperature overpressurization accident conditions.
Two pressurizer safety valve[s] are sufficient to relieve the overpressurization due to the inadvertent startup
of two charging pumps at water solid conditions without propagation of the assumed design basis flaw. The proposed
changes to address the concerns of Generic Letter 90&hyph;06 (Generic Issues 70 and 94) improve LTOPS availability
and reliability by instituting requirements for PORV, block valve, and control system testing and allowed outage
times for these components. Although these changes do not reduce the probability of occurrence or the consequences
of the LTOPS design basis (mass and heat addition) transients, the changes provide increased assurance that pressure
relieving devices will perform their design function when required.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
[2] create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated. The proposed
Technical Specifications modify pressure/temperature operating limits, LTOPS setpoints and enabling temperatures,
and component operability requirements. The revised pressure/temperature operating limits, and LTOPS setpoints
and enabling temperatures are only slightly different than those currently in the Technical 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Specifications. No operating limits or setpoints are added or deleted by the proposed changes. Therefore, it may
be concluded that the operating limits and setpoint changes do not create the possibility of a new or different kind
of accident. With regard to component operability requirements, restrictions on the number of charging pumps which
may be operable, the number of PORVs which must be operable, and the allowable temperature difference between the
steam generator primary and secondary remain unchanged. Only the setpoint temperature at which these restrictions
apply have been modified. The proposed changes are entirely consistent with the reactor vessel integrity protection
philosophy which ensures that the design basis reactor vessel flaw will not propagate under normal operation or postulated
accident conditions. Further, the proposed changes do not invalidate .&blank;.&blank;. any component design criteria
or the assumptions of any UFSAR [Updated Final Safety Analysis Report] Chapter 15 accident analyses. In addition,
modifications have been made to the Technical Specifications to improve availability and reliability of PORVs and
associated block valves. These changes have been made in accordance with NRC guidance in Generic Letter 90&hyph;06.
It may be concluded that none of the proposed changes creates the possibility of a new or different kind of accident
from any previously evaluated.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
[3] involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety. As described above, the reactor vessel integrity protection
philosophy ensures that the design basis assumed flaw will not propagate under normal operation or design basis accident
conditions. Adherence to the Technical Specification pressure/temperature operating limits ensures that the
margin to vessel fracture provided by the ASME Section XI methodology is maintained. With regard to LTOPS protection,
the safety analysis demonstrates that the proposed LTOPS design ensures margins consistent with those provided
by ASME Section XI Appendix G methods. This conclusion is based on industry experience with LTOPS events and engineering
evaluation. Specifically, both industry experience and engineering evaluation demonstrate that LTOPS design
basis events may be expected to occur at essentially isothermal conditions. Engineering evaluation demonstrates
that any reduction in allowable pressure due to thermal stresses which may be expected to occur during low temperature
operation is insignificant when compared to margins provided by the ASME Section XI Appendix G methods for calculating
pressure/temperature operating limits. Use of the isothermal pressure/temperature limit curve as the design limit
for establishing low temperature PORV lift setpoints has been approved for other utilities by the NRC. This design
maximizes the operating margin above the minimum RCS pressure for reactor coolant pump (RCP) operation, thereby
minimizing the probability of undesired PORV lifts during RCP startup. The proposed changes to address the concerns
of Generic Letter 90&hyph;06 (Generic Issues 70 and 94) improve LTOPS availability and reliability by instituting
requirements for PORV, block valve, and control system testing and allowed outage times for these components. Although
these changes do not increase the margin of safety demonstrated by the analysis of the LTOPS design basis (mass and
heat addition) transients, the changes provide increased assurance that pressure relieving devices will perform
their design function when required.

The proposed changes to the surveillance requirements for the control

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

As 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee has provided its analysis of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
issue of no significant hazards consideration, which is presented below: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Specifically, operation of North Anna Power Station in accordance with 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the proposed Technical Specifications changes will not:

<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
1. Involve a significant increase in the probability of occurrence 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
or consequences of an accident previously evaluated. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed change to the surveillance frequency for control 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
rods does not increase the probability of an accident occurrence. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Surveillance testing is a means of determining control rod 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
operability and does not of itself contribute to control rod 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
inoperability. Although reduced testing also implies a less 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
frequent confirmation of mechanical operability, operational 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
experience has established that the reduced testing does not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
decrease plant safety. Furthermore, reduced frequency testing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reduces the probability of an inadvertent operational transient 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
or misaligned control rod. There are other means available 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(e.g., Individual Rod Position Indicators, flux distributions 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
anomalies) to detect a misaligned control rod. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Reducing the frequency of surveillance testing will decrease the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
possibility of finding an inoperable control rod. Industry 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
experience has shown that most inoperable (stuck) control rods 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
are identified during rod drop testing and unit startup after 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
refueling outages. Therefore, the NRC has determined that a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reduced frequency surveillance test during power is acceptable to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
determine control rod operability (trippable). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The control rods will continue to be operated in the same manner 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
during the surveillance testing and will be available to shutdown 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the reactor if a Reactor Protection System trip setpoint is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reached. The operability requirements, alignment and insertion 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
limits for the control rods remain unchanged. Since the control 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
rods remain available (trippable) to perform their intended 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
safety function, testing of the control rods at the proposed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reduced frequency will not increase the consequences of an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
accident previously evaluated. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. Create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
from any accident previously evaluated. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed reduced frequency testing of the control rods does 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
not change the way the Control Rod Drive System or the control 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
rods are operated. The reduced frequency of testing of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
control rods does not alter the operation of the Control Rod 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Drive System or the control rods ability to perform their 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
intended safety function. Therefore, the reduced frequency 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
testing of the control rods does not generate any new accident 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
precursors. In fact, industry experience has shown that this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
surveillance testing may result in inadvertent reactor trips, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
dropped control rods, or unnecessary challenges to safety 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
systems. Therefore, the possibility of a new or different kind 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of accident than previously evaluated is not created by the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proposed changes in surveillance frequency of the control rods. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. Involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed reduced frequency testing of the control rods does 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
not change the control rod operability requirement or the way the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Control Rod Drive System is operated. NUREG&hyph;1366, concluded that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
most stuck control rods are discovered during plant startup after 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
refueling or during control rod drop testing. Therefore, routine 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
surveillance testing of the control rods at the proposed reduced 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
frequency is considered adequate to identify inoperable (stuck) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
control rods during operation. The reduced surveillance 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requirements do not affect the margin of safety in that the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
operability requirements remained unchanged and the existing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
safety analysis, which assumes the most reactive control rod

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Description of amendment request: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposed changes will modify the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
surveillance frequency of the control rod motion testing from monthly to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
quarterly. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee has provided its analysis of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
issue of no significant hazards consideration, which is presented below: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Specifically, operation of Surry Power Station in accordance with the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proposed Technical Specifications changes will not: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
1. Involve a significant increase in the probability of occurrence 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
or consequences of an accident previously evaluated. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed change to the surveillance frequency for control 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
rods does not increase the probability of an accident occurrence. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Surveillance testing is a means of determining control rod 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
operability and does not of itself contribute to control rod 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
inoperability. Although reduced testing also implies a less 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
frequent confirmation of mechanical operability, operational 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
experience has established that the reduced testing does not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
decrease plant safety. Furthermore, reduced frequency testing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reduces the probability of an inadvertent operational transient 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
or misaligned control rod. There are other means available 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(e.g., Individual Rod Position Indicators, flux distributions 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
anomalies) to detect a misaligned control rod. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Reducing the frequency of surveillance testing will decrease the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
possibility of finding an inoperable control rod. Industry 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
experience has shown that most inoperable (stuck) control rods 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
are identified during rod drop testing and unit startup after 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
refueling outages. Therefore, the NRC has determined that a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reduced frequency surveillance test during power is acceptable to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
determine control rod operability (trippable). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The control rods will continue to be operated in the same manner 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
during the surveillance testing and will be available to shutdown 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the reactor if a Reactor Protection System trip setpoint is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reached. The operability requirements, alignment and insertion 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
limits for the control rods remain unchanged. Since the control 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
rods remain available (trippable) to perform their intended 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
safety function, testing of the control rods at the proposed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reduced frequency will not increase the consequences of an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
accident previously evaluated. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. Create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
from any accident previously evaluated. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed reduced frequency testing of the control rods does 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
not change the way the Control Rod Drive System or the control 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
rods are operated. The reduced frequency of testing of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
control rods does not alter the operation of the Control Rod 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Drive System or the control rods ability to perform their 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
intended safety function. Therefore, the reduced frequency 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
testing of the control rods does not generate any new accident 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
precursors. In fact, industry experience has shown that this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
surveillance testing may result in inadvertent reactor trips, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
dropped control rods, or unnecessary challenges to safety 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
systems. Therefore, the possibility of a new or different kind 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of accident than previously evaluated is not created by the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proposed changes in surveillance frequency of the control rods. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. Involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed reduced frequency testing of the control rods does 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
not change the control rod operability requirement or the way the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Control Rod Drive System is operated. NUREG&hyph;1366, concluded that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
most stuck control rods are discovered during plant startup after 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
refueling or during control rod drop testing. Therefore, routine 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
surveillance testing of the control rods at the proposed reduced 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
frequency is considered adequate to identify inoperable (stuck) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
control rods during operation. The reduced surveillance 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requirements do not affect the margin of safety in that the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
operability requirements remained unchanged and the existing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
safety analysis, which assumes the most reactive control rod 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
sticks out of the core during accident scenarios, remains 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
bounding. Therefore, no margins of safety are adversely 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
affected.

reactor other than Indian Point 3. This temporary allowance is in effect for the period ending 3 years after restart
from the 1993/1994 Performance Improvement Outage and is needed to support management changes at the facility in
an effort to improve overall performance.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (the Commission) is considering issuance of amendments to Facility Operating
License Nos. NPF&hyph;76 and NPF&hyph;80, issued to Houston Lighting &amp; Power Company (the licensee) for the
South Texas Project, Units 1 and 2, located in Matagorda County, Texas.

Identification of Proposed Action
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
By letter dated May 27, 1993, the licensee proposed to upgrade the fuel used in the South Texas Project to Westinghouse's
VANTAGE 5 Hybrid (V5H) design and implement numerous safety analysis and operational margin improvements into the
South Texas Project Technical Specifications and Updated Final Safety Analysis Report. The proposed changes include
an increase in the maximum nominal enrichment for fuel assemblies from 4.5 weight percent (w/o) uranium-235 to 5.0
w/0.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
The Need for the Proposed Action
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The licensee upgraded to a higher enrichment fuel type to improve fuel economy and reduce the cobalt source term.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
Environmental Impacts of the Proposed Action
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Commission has completed its evaluation of the proposed revision to the technical specifications and concludes
that storage of new and spent fuel assemblies enriched with U&hyph;235 up to 5.0 w/0 at the South Texas Project, Units
1 and 2 is acceptable. The safety considerations associated has concluded that such changes would not adversely affect
plant safety. The proposed changes have no adverse affect on the probability of any accident. There will be no changes
to authorized power. As a result, there is no increase in individual or cumulative radiation exposure. The fuel burnup
will increase to 60,000 MWD/MTU. The radiological consequences of accidents have been reanalyzed to reflect this
increase and were determined not to be significantly changed.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The environmental impacts for transportation resulting from the use of higher enrichment and extended irradiation
are discussed in the staff assessment entitled ``NRC Assessment of the Environmental Effects of Transportation
Resulting from Extended Fuel Enrichment and Irradiation''. This assessment was published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
on August 11, 1988 (53 FR 30355) as corrected on August 24, 1988 (53 FR 32322) in connection with the Shearon Harris Nuclear
Power Plant, Unit 1: Environmental Assessment and Finding of No Significant Impact. As indicated therein, the environmental
cost contribution of an increase in fuel enrichment of up to 5 weight percent U&hyph;235 are either unchanged, or may
in fact be reduced from those summarized in Table S&hyph;4 as set forth in 10 CFR 51.52(c). These findings are applicable
to South Texas Project, Units 1 and 2. Accordingly, the Commission concludes that this proposed action would result
in no significant radiological environmental impact.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
Alternative to the Proposed Action
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Because the Commission's staff has concluded that there are no significant environmental impacts associated with
the proposed action, any alternatives would have either no significantly different environmental impact or greater
environmental impact. The principal alternative would be to deny the requested amendments. This would not reduce
the environmental impacts as a result of plant operations.

<DOCTITLE>Washington Public Power Supply System; WPPSS Nuclear Project No. 2 Environmental Assessment and Finding of No Significant
Impact</DOCTITLE>
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (the Commission) is considering issuing an exemption from the requirements
of Appendix J to 10 CFR Part 50 in response to a Washington Public Power Supply System (the licensee) request for the
WNP&hyph;2 nuclear plant, located in Benton County, Washington.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
Identification of Proposed Action
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposed action would grant an exemption from the requirement of Section III.D.3 of 10 CFR part 50, Appendix J for
Type C testing of new containment purge supply and exhaust valves with metallic seats each refueling shutdown. It
would extend the maximum interval for Type C testing from 24 months to 27 months for these valves. The proposed action
is in accordance with the licensee's March 25, 1994, exemption request.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
The Need for the Proposed Action
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The licensee needs the proposed exemption because the present requirement forces the licensee to test the new metal-to-metal
seated containment purge supply and exhaust valves at least every 24 months. Testing these valves every 27 months
does not increase the risk to public health and safety and accommodates the unique WNP&hyph;2 refueling schedule.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
Environmental Impacts of the Proposed Action
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposed exemption would not adversely affect primary containment integrity. Thus, it would not increase the
potential for radiological releases to the environment in the event of a severe plant transient or hypothetical accident,
including a fuel handling accident or design basis accident. Calculated offsite radiological doses at the plant
exclusion boundary and low population zone outer boundary will continue to meet 10 CFR part 100 criteria.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The licensee indicated that industry experience shows the new valves are capable of maintaining design leakage requirements
over an extended time. The licensee also indicated that they will require the replacement valves to meet even tighter
permissible leakage limits. Extending the maximum allowable interval between tests to 27 months allows for variations
in the approximately annual operating cycle length due to weather. Issuing this exemption will not increase accident
probability or result in any environmental impacts beyond those evaluated in the WNP&hyph;2 Final Environmental
Statement. Therefore, the proposed changes do not increase the probability or consequences of accidents, no changes
are being made in the types of any effluents that may be released offsite, and there is no significant increase in the
allowable individual or cumulative occupational radiation exposure. Accordingly, the Commission concludes that
this proposed action would result in no significant radiological environmental impact.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
With regard to potential nonradiological impacts, the proposed exemption does not affect nonradiological plant
effluents and has no other environmental impact. Therefore, the Commission concludes that there are no significant
nonradiological environmental impacts associated with the proposed exemption.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

Alternative to the Proposed Action
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

Any alternative with equal or greater environmental impact does not need to be evaluated since the Commission has
concluded that the environmental effects of the proposed action are not significant.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The principal alternative would be to deny the requested exemption. This would not reduce the facility's environmental
impact, and would result in a larger expenditure of licensee resources to test containment purge and exhaust valves.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (the Commission) is considering issuance of an exemption from the requirements
of 10 CFR part 50, Appendix E, Section IV.F.2 to Wolf Creek Nuclear Operating Corporation, (the licensee), for operation
of the Wolf Creek Generating Station, Unit 1, located in Coffey County, Kansas.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
Identification of Proposed Action
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section IV.F.2 of Appendix E to 10 CFR Part 50 states ``Each license at each site shall annually exercise its emergency
plan.'' By letter dated March 8, 1994, the licensee requested an exemption from the requirements of 10 CFR Part 50,
Section IV.F.2, that would delay the exercise scheduled for 1994 until early 1995. The delay was requested in order
to allow for the approval and implementation of revised emergency classification criteria submitted to the NRC by
letter dated December 15, 1993, and to avoid conflict with the seventh refueling outage currently scheduled to begin
in September 1994. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 50.12(a)(2)(v) of Title 10 of the Code of Federal Regulations provides an example of a special circumstance
for which the NRC will consider granting exemptions that involve cases providing only temporary relief from the applicable
regulation and for which the licensee has made good faith efforts to comply with the regulation. The licensee completed
an annual exercise in December 1993 and had scheduled the 1994 exercise for June 29, 1994. The proposed exemption would
delay the 1994 exercise until early 1995, approximately fourteen months after the 1993 exercise, and would not affect
the requirement to conduct the normally scheduled 1995 annual exercise.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
The Need for the Proposed Action
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposed exemption provides temporary relief to delay an annual emergency exercise in order to provide the licensee
an opportunity to implement revised emergency classification procedures and avoid conflict with a scheduled refueling
outage. The transition to the revised emergency action levels includes NRC review and additional training of licensee
personnel. Although these activities are expected to be completed during 1994, scheduling of the exercise for late
1994 would result in its coinciding with activities associated with the seventh outage. Both activities, the exercise
and refueling outage, are resource intensive and therefore, it is undesirable to schedule them for the same time period.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
Environmental Impacts of the Proposed Action 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Commission has completed its evaluation of the proposed exemption and concludes that granting of the temporary
relief does not affect the configuration of plant systems or any manner of their operation. The proposed exemption
is limited to a delay in the conduct of an annual emergency exercise such that the interval between the 1993 exercise
and the delayed exercise is extended to approximately fourteen months. The delay in the exercise does not constitute
a significant degradation in emergency planning and would therefore not result in an increase in radiological consequences
in the event of a major accident involving the release of radioactive materials. Accordingly, the Commission concludes
that this proposed action would result in no significant radiological evironmental impact. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
With regard to potential nonradiological impacts, the proposed exemption only involves the action of emergency
plan exercises. It does not affect nonradiological plant effluents and there are no other nonradiological environmental
impact associated with the proposed exemption. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
Alternatives to the Proposed Action
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Since the Commission concluded that there are no significant environmental impacts that would result from the proposed
action, any alternatives with equal or greater environmental impacts need not be evaluated. The principal alternative
would be to deny the requested exemption and require the licensee to conduct an emergency exercise during the 1994
calendar year. Conducting an exercise prior to implementation of the revised emergency action levels would reduce
potential benefits since key event classification procedures would be superseded shortly following the exercise.
Conducting the exercise late in 1994 would result in conflicts with the planning and execution of the seventh refueling
outage.

The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (the Commission) is considering issuance of an exemption from the requirements
of 10 CFR part 50, Appendix J, Section III.D.1(a) to Wolf Creek Nuclear Operating Corporation, (the licensee), for
operation of the Wolf Creek Generating Station, Unit 1, located in Coffey County, Kansas.

Identification of Proposed Action
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section III.D.1(a) of Appendix J to 10 CFR Part 50 requires the performance of three Type A tests, overall integrated
leakage rate tests (ILRTs), at approximately equal intervals during each 10-year service period with the third test
of each set being conducted when the plant is shutdown for the 10-year plant inservice inspections. Wolf Creek Nuclear
Operating Corporation performed the first two ILRTs for the first 10-year service period in October 1988 and September
1991. The licensee proposes to perform the third test during the eighth refueling outage which coincides with the
10-year plant inservice inspections. However, the current schedule for the eighth refueling outage would result
in the test being performed approximately six months beyond the 10-year service period.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 50.12(a)(2)(ii) of Title 10 of the Code of Federal Regulations provides an example of a special circumstance
for which the NRC will consider granting exemptions that involve cases for which application of the regulation is
not necessary to achieve the underlying purpose of the rule. The licensee completed ILRTs in October 1988 and September
1991. Strict application of Appendix J would require performance of another ILRT during the seventh refueling outage
in order to achieve three tests within the 10-year service period and a subsequent test during the eighth refueling
outage in order to perform an ILRT during the 10-year plant inservice inspections. In order to avoid performance of
the fourth ILRT, the licensee has proposed a one-time exemption to allow performance of the third ILRT during the eighth
refueling outage. Performance of the third test during the eighth refueling outage would result in the test being
performed approximately 54 months after the second test.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
The Need for the Proposed Action
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposed exemption would extend the performance of the third ILRT several months beyond the end of the first 10-year
service period in order to preclude the need to perform ILRTs during consecutive refueling outages. The need for the
exemption results from the requirement to perform the ILRT during refueling outages and the schedules associated
with the seventh and eighth refueling outages. ILRTs need to be performed during both the seventh and eighth refueling
outages to satisfy both aspects of the Appendix J periodic retest schedules; three tests during 10-year service intervals
with the third test during 10-year plant inservice inspections.

Environmental Impacts of the Proposed Action
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Commission has completed its evaluation of the proposed exemption and concludes that granting of the one-time
relief does not affect the configuration of plant systems or plant operating practices. The proposed exemption is
limited to the scheduling for the third ILRT during the first 10-year service interval. Previous testing has demonstrated
the integrity of the containment structure. Leakage through containment penetrations and valves would continue
to be identified by performance of local leak rate testing (LLRT). Therefore, no increase in the release of radioactive
materials following an accident would result from the extension of the ILRT testing interval. The extension of the
ILRT interval does not affect the radioactive effluent releases during normal operation. Accordingly, the Commission
concludes that this proposed action would result in no significant radiological environmental impact.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
With regard to potential nonradiological impacts, the proposed exemption only involves the scheduling of ILRT testing.
It does not affect nonradiological plant effluents and there are no other nonradiological environmental impacts
associated with the proposed exemption.

Alternatives to the Proposed Action

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Since the Commission concluded that there are no significant environmental impacts that would result from the proposed
action, any alternatives with equal or greater environmental impacts need not be evaluated. The principal alternative
would be to deny the requested exemption and require the licensee to conduct ILRT during both the seventh and eighth
refueling outages. Denial would not significantly reduce the environmental impact of plant operation and would
result in lost electrical generation and expense of significant licensee resources.

<DOCTITLE>Carolina Power &amp; Light Company; Consideration of Issuance of Amendment to Facility Operating License, Proposed
No Significant Hazards Consideration Determination, and Opportunity for a Hearing</DOCTITLE>
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (the Commission) is considering issuance of an amendment to Facility Operating
License No. NPF&hyph;63 issued to Carolina Power &amp; Light Company (the licensee) for operation of the Shearon
Harris Nuclear Power Plant, Unit 1, located in Wake and Chatham Counties, North Carolina.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed amendment would allow reduced power operation as a function of reactor coolant system (RCS) total flow
rate for flow rate reductions of up to 5 percent below the currently specified flow rate. Operation would be allowed
at total flow rates slightly lower than (293,540 gpm &times; (1.0 plus C1)) if rated thermal power (RTP) is reduced
by 1.5 percent for each one percent that RCS total flow is less than this rate. This change would provide for needed operational
margin and flexibility without the unnecessary penalty of a large power reduction.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Before issuance of the proposed license amendment, the Commission will have made findings required by the Atomic
Energy Act of 1954, as amended (the Act) and the Commission's regulations.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Commission has made a proposed determination that the amendment request involves no significant hazards consideration.
Under the Commission's regulations in 10 CFR 50.92, this means that operation of the facility in accordance with the
proposed amendment would not (1) involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident
previously evaluated; or (2) create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously
evaluated; or (3) involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety. As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee
has provided its analysis of the issue of no significant hazards consideration, which is presented below:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
1. The proposed amendment does not involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident
previously evaluated.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Since the proposed amendment does not involve any changes in the Reactor Coolant System (RCS) configuration, the
precursors to those Final Safety Analysis Report (FSAR) accidents previously evaluated are unchanged. RCS total
flow and RTP are traded off against one another to maintain the current departure from nucleate boiling ratio (DNBR)
margins. NRC-approved methodologies and the NRC-approved 17 &times; 17 Mechanical Design Report have been used
to verify that current design criteria continue to be satisfied. Therefore, there would be no increase in the probability
or consequences of an accident previously evaluated.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. The proposed amendment does not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously
evaluated.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed amendment does not involve any modifications or additions to plant equipment and the design and operation
of the unit will not be affected.The allowable reduction in the Power Range Neutron Flux-High Trip Setpoint will not
introduce any new FSAR Chapter 15 accident precursors. Therefore, the proposed changes do not create the possibility
of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. The proposed amendment does not involve a significant reduction in the margin of safety.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed change does not involve a reduction in the margin of safety as defined in the Bases to the Technical Specifications.
The RATED THERMAL POWER is reduced consistent with the RCS total flow to maintain the margin of safety. This margin
has been assessed by the evaluations performed with the approved methodologies as defined in the Technical Specifications.
The reduction of the Power Range Neutron Flux-High Trip Setpoint ensures that the DNBR margin for the analyses of record
is maintained for those FSAR Chapter 15 events that utilize the Power Range Neutron Flux-High Trip Setpoint trip function.
Therefore, the proposed changes do not involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
The NRC staff has reviewed the licensee's analysis and, based on this review, it appears that the three standards of
10 CFR 50.92(c) are satisfied. Therefore, the NRC staff proposes to determine that the amendment request involves
no significant hazards consideration.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Commission is seeking public comments on this proposed determination. Any comments received within 30 days after
the date of publication of this notice will be considered in making any final determination.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Normally, the Commission will not issue the amendment until the expiration of the 30-day notice period. However,
should circumstances change during the notice period such that failure to act in a timely way would result, for example,
in derating or shutdown of the facility, the Commission may issue the license amendment before the expiration of the
30-day notice period, provided that its final determination is that the amendment involves no significant hazards
consideration. The final determination will consider all public and State comments received. Should the Commission
take this action, it will publish in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 a notice of issuance and provide for opportunity for a hearing after issuance. The Commission expects that the need
to take this action will occur very infrequently.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Written comments may be submitted by mail to the Rules Review and Directives Branch, Division of Freedom of Information
and Publications Services, Office of Administration, U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission, Washington, DC 20555,

<!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
By June 24, 1994, the licensee may file a request for a hearing with respect to issuance of the amendment to the subject
facility operating license and any person whose interest may be affected by this proceeding and who wishes to participate
as a party in the proceeding must file a written request for a hearing and a petition for leave to intervene. Requests
for a hearing and a petition for leave to intervene shall be filed in accordance with the Commission's ``Rules of Practice
for Domestic Licensing Proceedings'' in 10 CFR part 2. Interested persons should consult a current copy of 10 CFR 2.714
which is available at the Commission's Public Document Room, the Gelman Building, 2120 L Street, NW., Washington,
DC 20555 and at the local public document room located at Cameron Village Regional Library, 1930 Clark Avenue, Raleigh,
North Carolina 27605. If a request for a hearing or petition for leave to intervene is filed by the above date, the Commission
or an Atomic Safety and Licensing Board, designated by the Commission or by the Chairman of the Atomic Safety and Licensing
Board Panel, will rule on the request and/or petition; and the Secretary or the designated Atomic Safety and Licensing
Board will issue a notice of hearing or an appropriate order. As required by 10 CFR 2.714, a petition for leave to intervene
shall set forth with particularity the interest of the petitioner in the proceeding, and how that interest may be affected
by the results of the proceeding. The petition should specifically explain the reasons why intervention should be
permitted with particular reference to the following factors: (1) The nature of the petitioner's right under the
Act to be made party to the proceeding; (2) the nature and extent of the petitioner's property, financial, or other
interest in the proceeding; and (3) the possible effect of any order which may be entered in the proceeding on the petitioner's
interest. The petition should also identify the specific aspect(s) of the subject matter of the proceeding as to which
petitioner wishes to intervene. Any person who has filed a petition for leave to intervene or who has been admitted
as a party may amend the petition without requesting leave of the Board up to 15 days prior to the first prehearing conference
scheduled in the proceeding, but such an amended petition must satisfy the specificity requirements described above.
Not later than 15 days prior to the first prehearing conference scheduled in the proceeding, a petitioner shall file
a supplement to the petition to intervene which must include a list of the contentions which are sought to be litigated
in the matter. Each contention must consist of a specific statement of the issue of law or fact to be raised or controverted.
In addition, the petitioner shall provide a brief explanation of the bases of the contention and a concise statement
of the alleged facts or expert opinion which support the contention and on which the petitioner intends to rely in proving
the contention at the hearing. The petitioner must also provide references to those specific sources and documents
of which the petitioner is aware and on which the petitioner intends to rely to establish those facts or expert opinion.
Petitioner must provide sufficient information to show that a genuine dispute exists with the applicant on a material
issue of law or fact. Contentions shall be limited to matters within the scope of the amendment under consideration.
The contention must be one which, if proven, would entitle the petitioner to relief. A petitioner who fails to file
such a supplement which satisfies these requirements with respect to at least one contention will not be permitted
to participate as a party.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Those permitted to intervene become parties to the proceeding, subject to any limitations in the order granting leave
to intervene, and have the opportunity to participate fully in the conduct of the hearing, including the opportunity
to present evidence and cross-examine witnesses.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If a hearing is requested, the Commission will make a final determination on the issue of no significant hazards consideration.
The final determination will serve to decide when the hearing is held.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If the final determination is that the amendment request involves no significant hazards consideration, the Commission
may issue the amendment and make it immediately effective, notwithstanding the request for a hearing. Any hearing
held would take place after issuance of the amendment.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If the final determination is that the amendment request involves a significant hazards consideration, any hearing
held would take place before the issuance of any amendment.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A request for a hearing or a petition for leave to intervene must be filed with the Secretary of the Commission, U.S.
Nuclear Regulatory Commission, Washington, DC 20555, Attention: Docketing and Services Branch, or may be delivered
to the Commission's Public Document Room, the Gelman Building, 2120 L Street, NW., Washington, DC 20555, by the above
date. Where petitions are filed during the last 10 days of the notice period, it is requested that the petitioner promptly
inform the Commission by a toll-free telephone call to Western Union at 1&hyph;800&hyph;248&hyph;5100 (in Missouri
1&hyph;(800) 342&hyph;6700). The Western Union operator should be given Datagram Identification Number N1023
and the following message addressed to William H. Bateman, petitioner's name and telephone number, date petition
was mailed, plant name, and publication date and page number of this 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 notice. A copy of the petition should also be sent to the Office of the General Counsel, U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission,
Washington, DC 20555, and to R.E. Jones, General Counsel, Carolina Power &amp; Light Company, Post Office Box 1551,
Raleigh, North Carolina 27602, attorney for the licensee.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Nontimely filings of petitions for leave to intervene, amended petitions, supplemental petitions and/or requests
for hearing will not be entertained absent a determination by the Commission, the presiding officer or the presiding
Atomic Safety and Licensing Board that the petition and/or requests should be granted based upon a balancing of the
factors specified in 10 CFR 2.714(a)(1)(i)&hyph;(v) and 2.714(d).

On June 4, 1993, the Boston Stock Exchange, Inc. (``BSE'' or ``Exchange'') submitted to the Securities and Exchange
Commission (``SEC'' or ``Commission''), pursuant to section 19(b)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (``Act'')

<FOOTCITE>2</FOOTCITE>

governing their registration and activity. The proposed rule change was published for comment in Securities Exchange
Act Release No. 32549 (June 29, 1993), 58 FR 36229 (July 6, 1993).

In addition, on July 7, 1993, September 24, 1993, and October 12, 1993, the Exchange filed with the Commission Amendment
Nos. 1, 2, and 3, respectively. The amendments were published for comment in Securities Exchange Act Release No. 33089
(October 22, 1993), 58 FR 58205 (October 29, 1993). Amendment Nos. 1 and 3 were largely technical, and resulted in deletions
from the final text of the rule.
<FOOTCITE>3</FOOTCITE>
 Amendment No. 2 adds to the procedures for CSs an index arbitrage provision
<FOOTCITE>4</FOOTCITE>
 and a restriction on cash payment for order flow by CSs in those stocks in which the specialist becomes registered as
a CS.

The substance of Amendment No. 1 concerned a requirement that appropriate Chinese Wall procedures be in place. In
Amendment No. 2, the Exchange deleted the substance of Amendment No. 1. The Exchange, however submitted a separate
proposed rule change (File No. SR&hyph;BSE&hyph;93&hyph;17) establishing Chinese Wall procedures. See Securities
Exchange Act Release No. 33090 (October 22, 1993) 58 FR 58206. That proposal is being separately approved today in
conjunction with approval of this rule proposal. Amendment No. 3 deleted a footnote that had been added in Amendment
No. 2.

The Commission notes that the current registered specialist (the ``regular'' specialist) in a particular stock
is not considered a ``competing specialist'' in that stock under the proposal, and therefore is not affected by this
prohibition. If, however, it applies to compete in a different stock, it is a ``competing specialist'' in that stock
and, pursuant to this rule change, may not pay for any order flow in that stock.

II. Description of the Proposal
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The purpose of the proposed rule change is to permit competing specialists on the floor of the BSE. Currently, each
stock traded on the BSE is assigned to one particular specialist. This contrasts with a multiple market maker system
where competing market makers compete for order flow in the same securities. The BSE competing specialist proposal
will permit up to three specialists
<FOOTCITE>6</FOOTCITE>
 in each stock, who would compete with each other for order flow.
<FOOTCITE>7</FOOTCITE>
 Each specialist will have the same affirmative and negative obligations as are imposed currently upon BSE specialists.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

</FOOTNAME>
<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposal provides for both a ``regular'' specialist (the current specialist) and up to two ``competing'' specialists.
The regular specialist would remain responsible for (1) updating quotations, (2) coordinating all openings and
reopenings to ensure that they are unitary, (3) inputing quotations on ITS to reflect the best BSE quote among all the
specialists, and (4) coordinating trading halts. The BSE will display only one consolidated quotation to other markets
in the National Market System.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

</FOOTNAME>
<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->
The scope of the pilot is further limited in that each competitor may specialize in a maximum of 10 stocks unless the
Market Performance Committee (``MPC'') approves an increase of up to 20 stocks per applicant firm. The MPC may approve
such an increase on a case-by-case basis. The BSE has represented that, during the pilot program, the total number
of stocks subject to competition will not exceed 360. See Securities Exchange Act Release No. 32549 (June 29, 1993),
58 FR 36229 (July 6, 1993).

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Moreover, the BSE rules governing the auction market principles of priority, parity, and precedence remain unchanged.
<FOOTCITE>8</FOOTCITE>
 Thus, if the specialists are quoting the same price (i.e., they are on price parity), the earliest bid/offer at that
price has time priority and will be filled first up to its specified size; and if the specialists are on both price and
time parity, then all bids/offers equal to or greater than the size of the contra-side order are on parity and entitled
to precedence over smaller ones (if it is possible to determine the order of time such orders were made, they shall be
filled in that order).

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
</FOOTNOTE>

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In addition to facilitating competition among the specialists, the proposal permits preferenced order routing.
Orders may be directed to any specialist based on the request of the firm submitting the order, or, if a particular specialist
is not specified, then the orders will be directed to the regular specialist.
<FOOTCITE>9</FOOTCITE>
 If an order is entered into BSE's automated order routing system (``BEACON'') by a member firm affiliated with a specialist,
that order automatically will be routed to that member firm's affiliated specialist, thereby preventing member
firms affiliated with a specialist from routing non-profitable orders through BEACON to the other specialist when
market conditions are unfavorable.

As noted below, however, if the CS is quoting the ITS/BBO and clearly has established priority on the BSE floor, then
the CS will fill the order despite the default routing to the regular specialist.

All limit orders in a pilot stock, regardless as to which specialist they are sent, will be represented and executed
strictly according to time priority in BEACON. Once all limit orders at the Intermarket Trading System best bid or
offer (``ITS/BBO'') or better are depleted, each specialist will be responsible for the market orders directed specifically
to it. BEACON (which handles approximately 95% of all order flow on the BSE) will execute automatically
<FOOTCITE>11</FOOTCITE>
 an incoming order against an order on the book, and only if there is no contra-side agency order on the limit order book
at the price will the incoming order be routed to the designated specialist for execution.

Any specialist seeking to terminate its status must so notify the MPC at least three business days prior to the desired
effective date of such withdrawal from competition. Withdrawal from registration by a CS will bar that CS from applying
to compete in that same stock for 90 days following the effective date of withdrawal. When the regular specialist requests
to be relieved of a stock, the stock will be posted for reallocation by the Stock Allocation Committee. In the interim,
if the MPC is satisfied that the CS can continue to maintain a fair and orderly market in such stock, the CS will serve
as the regular specialist until the stock has been reallocated.
<FOOTCITE>15</FOOTCITE>
 Where there is more than one CS in the stock, Exchange staff will place the stock with a caretaker

See letter from Robert P. Ackermann, Vice President, Regulation, Cincinnati Stock Exchange, to Jonathan G. Katz,
Secretary, Commission, dated July 29, 1993 (``CSE letter''). In sum, the CSE argues that because their current Dealer
Preferencing System is analogous to the BSE proposal, the same restrictions should be applied to both pilots, or,
in the alternative, the Commission should remove the restrictions from the CSE pilot. The restrictions include prohibitions
on direct cash payments for preferenced order flow, prohibitions on use of short-sale arbitrage programs, and limitations
on the scope of the program. All of these restrictions have been incorporated into the BSE proposal. See Amendments
Nos. 1, 2, and 3.

The CSE, Amex, and NYSE also recommended that the issue of competing specialist should be made part of the Market 2000
Study along with the Amex competing dealer proposal. Division of Market Regulation, U.S. Securities and Exchange
Commission, Market 2000: An Examination of Current Equity Market Developments (1994). The Amex's competing dealer
proposal seeks to alter the current rules of priority in regard to the orders of regional exchange specialists and
third market makers that are directed to the Amex. The issues raised in Amex's competing dealer proposal are fundamentally
different from the concerns raised by the competing specialist proposal which seeks to alter the current rules to
accomodate competitors on the floor of the BSE. Specifically, the Amex's proposal is intended to alter the treatment
of incoming orders from competing dealers, while the BSE proposal creates the ability for competing specialists
to compete on the floor of the Exchange.

A. Preferencing
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
All four commentators attempted to draw an analogy between the Cincinnati Dealer Preferencing Program (``CSE pilot'')
<FOOTCITE>23</FOOTCITE>
 and the BSE proposal by alleging that the latter is in fact a preferencing system despite the lack of a reference to the
term ``preferencing'' in the proposal.
<FOOTCITE>24</FOOTCITE>
 The NYSE also alleges that although the BSE rules currently provide for the same auction market procedures as NYSE
Rule 72, the competing specialist proposal effectively would change those procedures by always giving priority
to the designated specialist when no other contra-side agency orders are present.
<FOOTCITE>25</FOOTCITE>
 The BSE, in response, asserts that their priority, parity, and precedence rules work the same way as the NYSE rules
did, when competing specialists were permitted on their floor, in that a BSE specialist quoting the ITS/BBO would
have priority over the other specialist who is quoting an inferior market.

The CSE pilot originally was approved as a six month pilot for 60 issues per preferencing dealer. See Securities Exchange
Act Release No. 28866 (February 13, 1991), 56 FR 5854 (February 7, 1991). It was subsequently extended several times
and is currently approved through August 7, 1994. The number of CSE issues which a dealer may preference has been increased
periodically to 350. See Securities Exchange Act Release Nos. 29885 (October 30, 1991), 56 FR 56676; 30353 (February

B. Internalization
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Internalization of order flow is the ability of diversified firms to retain incoming customer orders by routing them
to their affiliated specialist for execution, thereby participating on both sides of the transaction. The NYSE asserts
that the BSE proposal could lessen auction market depth and efficiency because the preferenced order flow is internalized
by specialists, does not participate in the auction market, and is executed outside of it.
<FOOTCITE>27</FOOTCITE>
 The NYSE and Amex further maintain that by allowing internalization of order flow, the BSE proposal will diminish
the efficiencies of auction market pricing by denying preferenced orders any exposure to the primary market and opportunity
for price betterment thereon, and ultimately will lead to market fragmentation.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The NYSE believes the Commission should weigh possible positive effects of competing specialists, such as fostering
competition, against the potential negative effects, such as distortion of the auction market, and encourages the
Commission to undertake a more comprehensive study of preferencing in order to determine whether or not it works to
the benefit of the investing public.
<FOOTCITE>29</FOOTCITE>
 In response, the BSE suggests that competition will heighten as the competing specialists strive to establish priority
on the BSE floor.
<FOOTCITE>30</FOOTCITE>
 Moreover, according to the BSE, liquidity in the national market will increase at the ITS/BBO because (1) the competing
specialists will be forced to quote at the ITS/BBO to retain priority, and (2) the BSE quote disseminated when two or
more specialists are simultaneously bidding at the same price will reflect their aggregated size.

Consistent with traditional auction market principles, the only instance where preferencing would force a competitor
with clearly established priority on the BASE floor to step aside to a preferenced order is when the ITS/BBO is greater
than the BSE BBO. In such a circumstance, the BSE specialist does not have priority at the ITS/BBO and therefore BEACON
will route the order to whomever is the designated specialist. Conversation between Karen Aluise, Assistant Vice
President, Boston Stock Exchange, and N. Amy Bilbija, Commission, on December 16, 1993.

The Commission notes that the BSE is aware that it may not aggregate auto-quotes for dissemination in ITS because auto-quoting
in size is not permitted under the ITS Plan. An auto-quote is a systemic pricing change mechanism that generally tracks
on the primary market.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
</FOOTNOTE>

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The NYSE and Amex also note that the BSE system in theory requires marketable customer limit orders to be cleared before
a preferenced specialist can trade with its own order flow.
<FOOTCITE>32</FOOTCITE>
 The NYSE and Amex maintain, however, that there is nothing to prevent BSE member firms from withholding their limit
orders from the market, and sending them down to the exchange floor only when they have become marketable, at which
time they are paired off against the affiliated specialist for execution.
<FOOTCITE>33</FOOTCITE>
 The NYSE and Amex further assert that BSE firms with affiliated specialists would be motivated to act in such a fashion
because they would be providing each organization an ongoing opportunity to trade as principal with its customers'
market orders.
<FOOTCITE>34</FOOTCITE>
 The BSE, however, maintains that BEACON will not accommodate such a practice because the system does not accept paired
orders (where one side is an agency order and one side is a BSE market maker as principal).

The BSE states, and the NYSE notes, that all BSE market and marketable limit orders routed to a designated specialist
will still continue to be exposed for 15 seconds to allow the specialist to execute the order at a price better than the
ITS/BBO before automatic execution at the ITS/BBO.

Finally, the Amex further asserts that increased internalization resulting from the BSE proposal will lead to more
order flow to the BSE, which will in turn increase the amount of risk incurred by BSE specialists. As a result, the Amex
alleges, BSE specialists will ``lay off'' their risk on the primary market specialist by means of offsetting executions
following a BSE transaction,
<FOOTCITE>37</FOOTCITE>
 thus increasing the risk factor to the Amex specialists. The Amex concludes that this potential increased risk, and
the desire to foster protection of customer orders, is the basis for its pending competing dealer proposal.

The NYSE and Amex assert that the proposal represents a departure from agency/auction principles and a movement toward
``dealerization'' of regional exchange markets by encouraging firms to set up CSs in order to internalize preferenced
order flow which is thereby denied the chief benefits of auction market trading.

The CHX letter, although more of a commentary on the CSE pilot than on the BSE proposal, reaches the conclusion that
it would be inconsistent for the Commission to permit the CSE pilot to operate without permitting the more traditional
exchanges to compete by providing similar systems of their own.
<FOOTCITE>41</FOOTCITE>
 In addition, the CHX takes the position that the BSE proposal is a type of preferencing system, but contains fewer negative
aspects than does CSE's pilot. Therefore, the CHX believes it would be illogical to permit the CSE pilot to continue
while disapproving the BSE proposal.

D. Payment for Order Flow
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Both the CSE pilot and the BSE proposal include a prohibition against cash payments, by preferencing market makers
and CSs respectively, for preferenced order flow.
<FOOTCITE>43</FOOTCITE>
 The NYSE suggest that the BSE's restriction may be broader than the CSE's because it appears to apply to regular specialists
as well as CSs.
<FOOTCITE>44</FOOTCITE>
 The BSE response, however, emphasized that its restriction only applies to a CS in those stocks in which he becomes
registered as a CS. The NYSE, Amex, and BSE, however, concur that the Commission should address the payment for order
flow issue on a national level. The NYSE suggests that the Commission prohibit all dealers and specialists in all markets
from paying for order flow.
<FOOTCITE>45</FOOTCITE>
 The BSE response advocated a clear standard for all industry participants, suggesting that the Commission either
prohibit all dealers and specialists in all markets from paying for order flow or allow all such market participants
to decide the issue for themselves.
<FOOTCITE>46</FOOTCITE>
 The Amex agreed with the BSE in so far as the issue should be addressed in a conceptually consistent manner rather than
a piecemeal approach.

IV. Discussion
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
For the reasons discussed below, the Commission is approving the BSE competing specialist proposal on a one-year
pilot basis. During the pilot the BSE will be required to monitor the pilot, collect data, and submit reports as outlined
below.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As a preliminary matter, the Commission supports efforts by exchanges to provide increased market making and competition
on their trading floors or trading systems. Such efforts should increase the provision of liquidity services by an
exchange and enable it to compete more effectively with other markets. The addition of specialist competition on
the BSE floor could help in this regard. At the same time, the Commission is sensitive to the concerns of many of the commentators
about the structural implications of the preferencing feature of the BSE proposal. The Commission believes that
it is important that the competing specialist program provide real quote competition for the benefit of investors,
and not simply a means for firms to internalize their customer order flow while receiving specialist designation
and treatment. Accordingly, as discussed in more detail below, the Commission only is approving the BSE proposal
on a one-year pilot basis. During that time, the BSE is expected to monitor its pilot and provide the Commission with
a report on its operation detailing how the proposal has affected the quality of BSE's market, including its effect
on quote competition. The Commission expects the BSE to adequately demonstrate, through the periodic reporting
requirements outlined below and other such data as the Exchange may wish to generate, that there are in fact beneficial
competitive effects from the CS program. Specifically, the Commission expects the Exchange to analyze the effects
of the program on the quality of the market making by BSE specialists as a result of competition. For the reasons outlined
below, if the BSE cannot provide such an analysis, the Commission would have serious reservations about continuing
the preferencing feature of the program.

<!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As discussed above, many of the commentators discussed their views on CSE's preferencing pilot in commenting on the
BSE proposal and made certain conclusions about the effects of the BSE's proposal based on the experience with the
CSE preferencing pilot. Although the Commission believes the discussion is useful, we note that the CSE differs in
market structure and in the details of the preferencing system. Under the CSE's pilot, preferenced dealers have priority
over same-priced market maker or professional agency interest entered prior in time when the preferenced dealer
is interacting with the public agency market and marketable limit orders that he or she represents as agent.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
50
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Further, the CSE system does not currently provide for exposure for orders that would allow for potential price improvement
on incoming orders. Instead, price improvement on the CSE is only possible if the CSE dealer either (1) unilaterally
improves the price before sending the cross to the CSE for execution, or (2) voluntarily exposes the improved order
to the national consolidated quote system for possible improvement before filling it at the ITS/BBO.

</FOOTNOTE>

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The BSE has attempted to design its proposal to enable customers to receive best execution of their orders while stimulating
competition among specialists. As previously stated, the proposal does not alter the auction market principles
of priority, parity, and precedence. In addition, limit orders will continue to be executed in accordance with traditional
auction market principles. Under the BSE proposal, all limit orders will be represented and executed strictly according
to time priority according to the order of their receipt in Beacon, irrespective of which specialist they are sent
to. Further, all market and marketable limit orders will continue to receive a 15 second exposure for possible price
improvement.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
51
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Before an incoming preferenced order is executed against the specialist, Beacon scans its limit order book. If there
is a contra-side order on the book, Beacon will match up the two orders and execute without the specialist's participation
(unless the specialist opts to improve the price).

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
</FOOTNOTE>

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The BSE proposal also is designed to provide for potential quote competition. The only time the BSE's proposed preferencing
feature can force a non-designated specialist with clearly established priority on the BSE floor to yield priority
to a preferenced competitor, so that it may trade as principal with the incoming preferenced order, is when (1) the
ITS/BBO is greater than the BSE BBO, and (2) there is no contra-side agency order priced equal to or better than the ITS/BBO
(i.e., all limit orders at the price have been depleted). The BSE asserts that this will enhance quote competition
and, at a minimum, add liquidity at the ITS/BBO.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Commission recognizes that BSE specialists currently quote at the best ITS price only 5% of the time.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
52
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The proposal, however, allegedly provides an incentive for specialists desiring to attract order flow to quote more
often at the ITS/BBO. If the BSE's assertion is correct in that the specialists will be motivated to compete for priority
on the floor, then liquidity could be enhanced at the ITS/BBO. In addition, if the specialists are simultaneously
bidding at the same price, the sizes will be aggregated for purposes of disseminating the BSE quote.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
53
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 In sum, the proposal potentially could add depth at the ITS/BBO if the BSE specialists begin to quote at the best ITS
price more frequently than is the practice today, and thereby improve the overall quality of the BSE market place.
Although it is unclear whether the BSE proposal will have this result, the Commission intends to carefully evaluate
the effects on the quality of the BSE market from this potential ``quote competition'' and whether the majority of
preferenced orders are executed by the affiliated specialist when quoting at less than the ITS/BBO. As indicated
above, the Commission expects the BSE to provide sufficient evidence confirming the existence of enhanced quote
competition.

<!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
With respect to the BSE proposal's effect on internalization of order flow, and the potential for market fragmentation
as a result, the Commission's Division of Market Regulation (``Division'') recently examined the extent of market
fragmentation in its Market 2000 Study. The Division found that multiple, varied market centers and competitors
for listed stocks has provided many benefits to the users of the markets without impairing market quality or price
discovery. The Division concluded that concerns about fragmentation have been overstated. However, the Commission
is concerned that the implementation of a preferencing system at one or more exchanges may alter the analysis.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The potential effects of internalization by BSE specialists, however, are difficult to analyze without some experience
about the effects of the pilot. The Commission does note that if the program of competing specialists is used merely
to expand the number of specialists internalizing order flow rather than as a means of improving the quality of BSE
markets, then the proposal would raise additional questions as to whether the competing specialists are acting as
active market makers and deserve specialist designation and the benefits accruing thereto. Accordingly, although
the BSE proposal may result in more internalization of order flow, the Commission is not willing at this time to conclude
that it will be detrimental to the quality of the equity markets, but instead intends to revisit this issue at the expiration
of the pilot. In reaching this conclusion, the Commission emphasizes that the BSE proposal is limited in scope, and
best execution of customer orders in the context of fair competition is still a primary objective. Under the proposal,
customer orders will continue to be able to interact, and the opportunity for price improvement exists.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The preferencing feature of the competing specialist program also raises questions about the use of payment for order
flow by BSE specialists. As discussed previously, during the pilot program a CS will be prohibited from making cash
payments for order flow in those stocks in which it is registered as a CS. Such a prohibition is important to assess the
effects of the proposal and incentives for market participants to take part in it and to benefit therefrom. The Commission
is still considering the concerns regarding the issue of payment for order flow on the national level. On October 7,
1993, the Commission published for comment Rule 11Ac1&hyph;3 and amendments to Rule 10b&hyph;10 under the Act relating
to enhanced disclosure of payment for order flow practices. The Commission also sought comments on various alternative
approaches to payment for order flow, such as banning the practice outright, pass-through the payment to customers,
and decimalization.
<FOOTCITE>54</FOOTCITE>
 Accordingly, any final outcome in that rule making procedure may ultimately effect the payment for order flow issue
in the BSE's pilot.

due to the relationship between the entities.

</FOOTNOTE>

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Based on the above, the Commission believes it is appropriate to allow the BSE to implement its competing specialist
proposal on a one-year pilot basis. In making this determination, the Commission has carefully analyzed the potential
benefits from competition, such as better quotes, with the potential for increased internalization of order flow.
The Commission believes that the BSE has incorporated features in its proposal to allow it to implement, for a one-year
period, a competing specialist system that will allow firms to designate order flow to an affiliated specialist.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Commission, nevertheless, believes that before the BSE proposal will be extended beyond the one-year pilot period
or approved on a permanent basis, the BSE will have the burden to prove that its proposal resulted in added depth and
liquidity to its market and improved quotations. The Commission emphasizes that if the Commission is dissatisfied
with the data or the market effects of the pilot, it would not be inclined to extend the competing specialist program.
Accordingly, the Commission requests that the BSE provide, on a quarterly basis, the following information:

Further, we request the Exchange to submit a report to the Commission, discussing the data outlined above, eight months
from the date of commencement of the competing specialist pilot. The report should discuss such data in terms of the
effects of the competing specialist pilot on the quality of the BSE market with respect to depth, liquidity, and quote
improvement.

Should any other exchange attempt to implement a similar system that is acceptable to the Commission, it should be
noted that the pilot period would be limited to the same one year period afforded the BSE. At the end of such period, all
such systems will be subject to the same rigorous scrutiny regardless of how long they may have been in operation.

V. Conclusion
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Commission finds preliminarily that the proposed rule change is consistent with the requirements of the Act and
the rules and regulations thereunder applicable to a national securities exchange, and, in particular, with the
requirements of section 6(b).
<FOOTCITE>57</FOOTCITE>
 In particular, the Commission preliminarily believes the proposal is consistent with section 6(b)(5) because it
is designed to promote just and equitable principles of trade, to foster cooperation and coordination with persons
engaged in regulating, clearing, settling, processing information with respect to, and facilitating transactions
in securities, to remove impediments to and perfect the mechanism of free and open market and a national market system.

Pursuant to section 19(b)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (``Act''),
<FOOTCITE>1</FOOTCITE>
 notice is hereby given that on December 27, 1993, Delta Government Options Corp. (``DGOC'') filed with the Securities
and Exchange Commission (``Commission'') the proposed rule change as described in items I, II, and III below, which
Items have been prepared substantially by DGOC. On February 16, 1994, and on March 4, 1994, DGOC submitted substantive
amendments to the filing. The Commission is publishing this notice to solicit comments on the proposed rule change
from interested persons.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In its filing with the Commission, DGOC included statements concerning the purpose of and basis for the proposed rule
change and discussed any comments it received on the proposed rule change. The text of these statements may be examined
at the places specified in Item IV below. DGOC has prepared summaries, set forth in sections (A), (B), and (C) below,
of the most significant aspects of such statements.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
A. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Under current practice, the exercise settlement date, depending on certain factors, occurs from two to five business
days following the expiration date or the date on which an exercise notice is tendered. Under the proposed amendments
to section 1004 of DGOC's procedures, the exercise settlement date for an option contract on a Treasury bond or a Treasury
note will be (1) the next business day following the date on which an exercise notice is purposely assigned for those
contracts exercised on a day preceding the expiration date and (2) the next business day following the expiration
date for those contracts exercised on the expiration date. For an option contract on a Treasury bill, the exercise
settlement date will be the next business day after an exercise notice is properly tendered. The purpose of the proposal
is to respond to participants who have requested that DGOC's settlement procedures more closely follow the practices
already established in the over-the-counter (``OTC'') marketplace for the settlement of purchases and sales of
Treasury securities and for the settlement of exercised options on such securities.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
By shortening DGOC's settlement period to conform to the industry standard, DGOC will reduce the amount of time such
settlement obligations remain outstanding which in turn will reduce credit exposure to DGOC as well as in the overall
cash market clearing system for the settlement of Government securities. Using the same settlement period for the
settlement of exercised options and for the settlement of securities in the cash market will ensure a consistent approach
among clearing entities and will serve as a platform for additional coordination among clearing entities clearing
identical or complimentary securities. In addition to reducing credit risk in the clearance system, a shortening
of the settlement cycle will further reduce risk by enabling DGOC to uncover potential problems earlier and will allow
DGOC to make expedited determinations of whether failures by participants to deliver securities are due to processing
problems, market effect, or credit related difficulties.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Because DGOC's current settlement period of two to five business days is longer than the settlement period for similar
OTC products cleared outside of DGOC, DGOC-issued options carry a price adjustment for the additional financing
costs. As a result, the price of DGOC-issued options does not match exactly those of similar OTC-traded options. Implementation
of DGOC's revised settlement procedures will make the relative values of DGOC-issued options comparable to those
of OTC-traded options and will eliminate participants' need to make the additional calculations necessary to correlate
the price of DGOC-issued options with the price of OTC-traded options. Therefore, this proposal should provide participants
greater ease in trading and exercising options issued by DGOC and will allow for the automated clearance and settlement
of securities transactions that otherwise would be cleared through decentralized and labor intensive processes.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In connection with the modifications to the exercise settlement date, DGOC is proposing to amend section 1005 of its
Procedures to provide that DGOC will allocate exercise settlement obligations prior to 8 a.m. on the business day
prior to the exercise settlement date. Currently, DGOC allocates exercise settlement obligations on the second
business day prior to the exercise settlement date.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
DGOC also is proposing to amend section 1102 of its procedures to clarify its buy-in process applicable when a participant
fails to make a required delivery of Treasury securities to DGOC. First, upon the request of the participant failing
to deliver and with good cause shown, DGOC will be authorized to defer the execution of a buy-in. Currently, DGOC can
defer the execution of a buy-in for no more than twenty-four hours. Second, the time for the delivery of a notice of buy-in
from DGOC to the participant which failed to deliver will be specifically set forth is thirty calendar days after the
failure to deliver.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Delta believes the proposed rule change is consistent with requirements of the Act, particularly section 17A of the
Act,
<FOOTCITE>2</FOOTCITE>
 and the rules and regulations thereunder applicable to DGOC. This is because the proposed rule change will permit
more utilization of the DGOC system by those participants who prefer to trade in options for hedging purposes or for
speculation.

enable DGOC to control risk better, to provide greater flexibility to its participants, and to permit more utilization
of DGOC and thereby the national clearance and settlement system for trading in options.

I. Description
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposed rule change amends DGOC's definition of ``expiration date,'' found in Article I of DGOC's Procedures,
to provide that the expiration date may occur on any business day on or before the second anniversary of the writing
of the option contract.
<FOOTCITE>3</FOOTCITE>
 The proposal is a response to DGOC participants' requests that DGOC afford them the opportunity to select expiration
dates that match more precisely the tenor of other financial contracts developed in the over-the-counter market
and in other trading environments. The proposal enables participants to submit for processing at DGOC treasury options
trades that prior to this proposal could not have been submitted to DGOC because their stated expiration dates were
not available through DGOC.

Previously, DGOC's rules provided that the expiration date could have been on any Friday that occurred not later than
the last Friday of the month in which the second anniversary of the writing of the option occurred.

II. Discussion
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 17A(b)(3)(F) of the Act that the rules of a clearing agency must promote the prompt and accurate clearance
and settlement of securities transactions and must remove impediments to and must perfect the mechanism of a national
system for the prompt and accurate clearance and settlement of securities transactions.
<FOOTCITE>4</FOOTCITE>
 The proposal enlarges the class of treasury option trades eligible for clearance and settlement at DGOC. By potentially
increasing the number of trades that will be cleared and settled through DGOC, which is a registered clearing agency
with automated clearance and settlement procedures, the proposal facilitates the prompt and accurate clearance
and settlement of securities transaction. Furthermore, more trades can be processed through the national clearance
and settlement system that otherwise would have to be settled through decentralized and more inefficient operations.

In addition, the proposal affords DGOC participants with additional flexibility to adjust duration in relation

III. Conclusion
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
For the reasons stated above, the Commission finds that the proposed rule change is consistent with section 17A of
the Act.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
It is therefore ordered,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Pursuant to section 19(b)(2) of the Act, that the proposed rule change (File No. SR&hyph;DGOC&hyph;94&hyph;01)

The proposed rule change modifies the time for tender of exercise notices by DGOC participants maintaining long positions;
the procedure DGOC uses to assign exercise notices to participants maintaining short positions; and the time by which
exercise notices will be assigned. Section 1001 (Exercise Procedures) of DGOC's Procedures establishes the time
by which a participant must tender to DGOC's clearing bank an option exercise notice. The cutoff time is revised from
5:00 p.m. to 4 p.m. or such earlier time as may be announced by the Public Securities Association as the recommended
closing time for trading in the government securities markets on the business day the participant wishes to exercise
an option contract.

DGOC inquired of all its participants that maintain long positions with DGOC whether they perceived any special burden
associated with the one hour reduction in the time available for exercise. If any participant had wished to maintain
the 5 p.m. exercise notice tendering time on any outstanding option, DGOC would have deferred implementation of the
proposed rule change until one day following the expiration of all such outstanding options subject to the 5 p.m. time.
No participant wanted to defer implementation of the proposed rule change. Telephone conversation between Kathryn
Natale, Attorney, Morgan, Lewis &amp; Bockius and Christine Sibille, Attorney, Division of Market Regulation,
Commission (May 13, 1994).

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
</FOOTNOTE>

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
DGOC's Procedures section 1002 (Assignment of Exercise Notices) described the manner in which exercise notices
are assigned to participants. Prior to this amendment, when less than all exercisable options in a class of options
(
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
i.e.,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 all puts and calls covering the same issue of Treasury securities) were exercised, exercise notices were assigned
randomly to participants that maintained short positions in that class of options. As amended, exercise notices
are assigned to each participant maintaining a short position in the same class of options on a pro rata basis. DGOC
determines the number of exercise notices allocated to a participant by dividing the number of options subject to
exercise maintained by such participant by the number of all options in the same class. This number is multiplied by
the total number of exercise notices received by DGOC for the class of options.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Finally, the proposal change the time by which exercise notices will be assigned under DGOC's Procedures section
1002. Previously, exercise notices were assigned at or before 8 a.m. on the business day following the business day
that DGOC's clearing bank accepted them. With this amendment, exercise notices are to be assigned at or before 5:00
p.m. on the same business day that DGOC's clearing bank accepts them.

Section 17A(b)(3)(F) of the Act provides that the rules of a clearing agency must protect investors and the public
interest and must remove impediments to and must perfect the mechanism of a national system for the prompt and accurate
clearance and settlement of securities transactions.
<FOOTCITE>4</FOOTCITE>
 By requiring that all option exercise notices be tendered prior to 4 p.m., DGOC will have the ability to assign option
exercises earlier and give notice of the assignments earlier. By receiving notification of their allocated option
exercises earlier, participants can manage more precisely their financial exposure by having the ability to engage
in other trading on that business day. This capacity should allow participants to manage their risks more effectively,
thus furthering the goal of protecting investors.

In addition, the Commission believes that the new method of allocation of option exercises is consistent with the
Act. By assigning option exercises according to a precise formula based on a pro rata allocation instead of a random
allocation, participants will be provided some basis for determining the likelihood that they will be assigned a
certain number of option exercises. The procedure also will assign the option exercises on a fairer basis.

<FOOTCITE>1</FOOTCITE>
 notice is hereby given that on May 9, 1993, The Intermarket Clearing Corporation (``ICC'') filed with the Securities
and Exchange Commission (``Commission'') the proposed rule change (File No. SR&hyph;ICC&hyph;94&hyph;03) as
described in Items I, II, and III below, which Items have been prepared primarily by ICC, a self-regulatory organization.
The Commission is publishing this notice to solicit comments on the proposed rule change from interested persons.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposed rule change amends the definition of ``premium margin'' in ICC's Margin Resolution.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In its filing with the Commission, ICC has included statements concerning the purpose of and basis for the proposed
rule change and discussed any comments it received on the proposed rule change. The text of these statements may be
examined at the places specified in Item IV below. ICC has prepared summaries, set forth in sections A, B, and C below,
of the most significant aspects of such statements.

A. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The rule change amends the definition of the term ``premium margin'' to incorporate terminology that is more consistent
with the pricing practices of the commodities markets. With respect to certain unexercised or unassigned positions
in option contracts, ICC previously defined premium margin in pertinent part to be ``the current highest per-unit
asked premium quotation for options'' at the close of trading on the preceding trading day. For purposes of ICC's Margin
Resolution, the term ``option contracts'' includes both commodity and securities options. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
While the reference to the ``per-unit asked premium quotation'' is appropriate terminology with respect to securities
options, it is less appropriate with respect to commodity options. In the commodity markets, a single commodity option
price (i.e., a ``settlement price'') for each contract is disseminated at the close of trading rather than two prices
(i.e., bid and ask quotes) as in the equity markets. Accordingly, ICC's Margin Resolution is being amended to incorporate
the term ``settlement prices'' in the definition of premium margin where it is appropriate. The Margin Resolution
now defines premium margin in pertinent part to be ``the current highest per-unit asked premium quotation with respect
to an OCC Option, or the settlement price with respect to a commodity option for options.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ICC believes that the proposed rule change is consistent with section 17A of the Act
<FOOTCITE>2</FOOTCITE>
 in that it conforms the terminology used in ICC's Margin Resolution with the practices used in the commodities markets.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
NSCC currently applies a factor to the clearing fund requirement for members' non-CNS activity. The Depository Trust
Company (``DTC'') settlement activity of members which NSCC sponsors into DTC (``sponsored members'') is included
in the non-CNS calculation. The factor is applicable when certain amounts owed by the member to NSCC exceed the member's
excess net capital. For the reasons set forth below, NSCC desires to eliminate application of the factor to the sponsored
member's DTC settlement activity. In lieu thereof, NSCC has determined to add an additional advisory surveillance
criteria to cover the circumstance where the debit activity of the sponsored member is greater that its excess net
capital.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->
``Advisory surveillance status'' permits NSCC, among other things, to increase on a discretionary basis the member's
clearing fund requirement with respect to non-CNS activity up to sum of 5% of the member's average daily non-CNS debits
plus 2&hyph;1/2% of the member's average daily non_CNS credits.

In File No. SR&hyph;NSCC&hyph;82&hyph;10,
<FOOTCITE>3</FOOTCITE>
 NSCC amended its clearing fund formula to permit the collection of additional clearing fund deposits from members
using the envelope settlement systems. Prior to that filing, NSCC's clearing fund formula required each member to
contribute an amount equal to 21/2% of the member's average daily debits and credits with NSCC. The amendment set forth
in File No. SR&hyph;NSCC&hyph;82&hyph;10 broke out the debits and credits associated with the envelope settlement
systems and required clearing fund deposits with respect to activity in those systems as follows:

NSCC's proposed rule change set forth in File No. SR&hyph;NSCC&hyph;82&hyph;10 was approved in Securities Exchange
Act Release No. 18852 (June 18, 1982), 47 FR 29426.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
Each Member would have to contribute an amount equal to 21/2NSCC of its average daily envelope settlement systems
debits and credits or 5% of its average daily envelope settlement systems debits, whichever was greater. In each case,
the amount would be multiplied by a factor which represented the number of times, if any, by which the Member's average
daily settlement debits exceeded its excess net capital.

NSCC's proposed rule change set forth in File No. SR&hyph;NSCC&hyph;82&hyph;24 was approved in Securities Exchange
Act Release No. 19147 (October 18, 1982), 47 FR 47351.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
</FOOTNOTE>

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As indicated in the File No. SR&hyph;NSCC&hyph;82&hyph;10, the primary purpose of the factor was to better protect
NSCC against the risks presented by the envelope settlement systems (i.e., that securities delivered through the
envelope settlement systems would not be available for return to the deliverer in the event the receiver were to become
insolvent and be unable to pay for the delivery). The concern at the time of File No. SR&hyph;NSCC&hyph;82&hyph;10
arose from the stock loan business that was settled through the envelope settlement system. NSCC did not, however,
limit the application of the factor to just physical envelope deliveries but also applied it to the DTC settlement
activity of sponsored members. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
NSCC believes that the current clearing fund formula, as applied to sponsored members, can result in excessive clearing
fund requirements. This is because the formula seeks to cover a risk relating to DTC activity which NSCC believes can
be adequately addressed without the application of the factor. The proposed rule change, while eliminating the factor
in determining a sponsored member's clearing fund requirement with respect to DTC activity, gives NSCC the ability
to place a sponsored member on advisory surveillance status under the circumstances where the factor previously
would have been applied and therefore will allow NSCC to continue to assess the risks associated with sponsored members'
DTC settlement activity.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The elimination of the application of a factor in determining a sponsored member's clearing fund requirement with
respect to DTC activity will more appropriately reflect the risks associated with such activity and will be consistent
with the way DTC addresses such risks for dual NSCC/DTC members. Thus, it will result in a more equitable distribution
of the financial burdens placed on NSCC sponsored members. Therefore, NSCC believes that this rule change is consistent
with the requirements of the Act, particularly section 17A of the Act,
<FOOTCITE>5</FOOTCITE>
 and the rules thereunder.

Ford Motor Company (``Company'') has filed an application with the Securities and Exchange Commission (``Commission''),
pursuant to section 12(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (``Act'') and Rule 12d&hyph;2(d) promulgated thereunder,
to withdraw the above specified security from listing and registration on the Boston Stock Exchange, Inc. (``BSE''),
Chicago Stock Exchange, Inc. (``CHX''), and Philadelphia Stock Exchange, Inc. (``Phlx''). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The reasons alleged in the application for withdrawing this security from listing and registration include the following:

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
According to the Company, in order to reduce expenses and simplify its stock exchange processes, the Company has decided
to withdraw those listings that are costly to maintain and have very low trading volumes. These include the Company's
listings on the BSE, CHX, and Phlx. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
According to the Company, it will continue listing its shares on the New York Stock Exchange, Inc. (``NYSE'') and,
given the very low volume on the regional exchanges, it is not believed there will be any adverse impact on the market
or Company stockholders by the proposed withdrawals. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Any interested person may, on or before June 10, 1994 submit by letter to the Secretary of the Securities and Exchange
Commission, 450 Fifth Street, NW., Washington, DC 20549, facts bearing upon whether the application has been made
in accordance with the rules of the exchanges and what terms, if any, should be imposed by the Commission for the protection
of investors. The Commission, based on the information submitted to it, will issue an order granting the application
after the date mentioned above, unless the Commission determines to order a hearing on the matter.

Teleflex Incorporated (``Company'') has filed an application with the Securities and Exchange Commission (``Commission''),
pursuant to section 12(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (``Act'') and Rule 12d2&hyph;2(d) promulgated thereunder,
to withdraw the above specified security from listing and registration on the American Stock Exchange, Inc. (``Amex'').
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The reasons alleged in the application for withdrawing this security from listing and registration include the following:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
According to the Company, in addition to being listed on the Amex, its common stock is listed on the New York Stock Exchange,
Inc. (``NYSE''). The Company's common stock commenced trading on the NYSE at the opening of business on April 28, 1994
and concurrently therewith such securities were suspended from trading on the Amex.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In making the decision to withdraw its common stock from listing on the Amex, the Company considered the direct and
indirect costs and expenses attendant on maintaining the dual listing of its securities on the NYSE and the Amex. The
Company does not see any particular advantage in the dual trading of its common stock and believes that dual listing
would fragment the market therefor.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Any interested person may, on or before June 10, 1994 submit by letter to the Secretary of the Securities and Exchange
Commission, 450 Fifth Street, NW., Washington, DC 20549, facts bearing upon whether the application has been made

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As a result of the President's major disaster declaration on May 13, 1994, I find that Aroostook County in the State
of Maine constitutes a disaster area as a result of damages caused by heavy rains, unseasonably warm temperatures,
severe ice jams and flooding which occurred April 15, 1994, and continuing. Applications for loans for physical damage
may be filed until the close of business on July 12, 1994, and for economic injury until the close of business on February
14, 1995, at the address listed below: U.S. Small Business Administration, Disaster Area 1 Office, 360 Rainbow Boulevard
South, 3rd floor, Niagara Falls, NY 14303; or other locally announced locations. In addition, applications for economic
injury loans from small businesses located in the following contiguous counties may be filed until the specified
date at the above location: Penobscot, Piscataquis, and Washington Counties in the State of Maine.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) announces its findings on the noise compatibility program submitted
by the State of Hawaii, Department of Transportation, under the provisions of title I of the Aviation Safety and Noise
Abatement Act of 1979 (Public Law 96&hyph;193) and 14 CFR part 150. These findings are made in recognition of the description
of Federal and non-Federal responsibilities in Senate Report No. 96&hyph;52 (1980). On November 4, 1993, the FAA
determined that the noise exposure maps submitted by the State of Hawaii, Department of Transportation, under part
150, were in compliance with applicable requirements. On May 3, 1994, the Administrator approved the Hilo International
Airport noise compatibility program. Eight of the ten recommendations of the program were approved, one was approved
in part, and one had no action.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
This notice announces that the FAA has given its overall approval to the noise compatibility program for the Hilo International
Airport, effective May 3, 1994.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Under section 104(a) of the Aviation Safety and Noise Abatement Act of 1979 (hereinafter referred to as ``the Act''),
an airport operator who has previously submitted a noise exposure map may submit to the FAA a noise compatibility program
which sets forth the measures taken or proposed by the airport operator for the reduction of existing incompatible
land uses and prevention of additional incompatible land uses within the area covered by the noise exposure maps.
The Act requires such programs to be developed in consultation with interested and affected parties including local
communities, government agencies, airport users, and FAA personnel.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Each airport noise compatibility program developed in accordance with Federal Aviation Regulations (FAR) part
150 is a local program, not a Federal program. The FAA does not substitute its judgment for that of the airport proprietor
with respect to which measures should be recommended for action. The FAA's approval or disapproval of FAR part 150
program recommendations is measured according to the standards expressed in part 150 and the Act and is limited to
the following determinations:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a. The noise compatibility program was developed in accordance with the provisions and procedures of FAR part 150;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
b. Program measures are reasonably consistent with achieving the goals of reducing existing incompatible land uses
around the airport and preventing the introduction of additional incompatible land uses;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
c. Program measures would not create an undue burden on interstate or foreign commerce, unjustly discriminate against
types or classes of aeronautical uses, violate the terms of airport grant agreements, or intrude into areas pre-empted
by the Federal Government; and

<!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
d. Program measures relating to the use of flight procedures can be implemented within the period covered by the program
without derogating safety, adversely affecting the efficient use and management of the navigable airspace and air
traffic control systems, or adversely affecting other powers and responsibilities of the Administrator prescribed
by law.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Specific limitations with respect to FAA's approval of an airport noise compatibility program are delineated in
FAR Part 150, &sect;150.5. Approval is not a determination concerning the acceptability of land uses under Federal,
state, or local law. Approval does not by itself constitute an FAA implementing action. A request for Federal action
or approval to implement specific noise compatibility measures may be required, and an FAA decision on the request
may require an environmental assessment of the proposed action. Approval does not constitute a commitment by the
FAA to financially assist in the implementation of the program nor a determination that all measures covered by the
program are eligible for grant-in-aid funding from the FAA. Where federal funding is sought, requests for project
grants must be submitted to the FAA Airports District Office in Honolulu, Hawaii.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The State of Hawaii, Department of Transportation submitted to the FAA on December 28, 1992, the noise exposure maps,
descriptions, and other documentation produced during the noise compatibility planning study conducted from January
1990 through December 1992. The Hilo International Airport noise exposure maps were determined by FAA to be in compliance
with applicable requirements on November 4, 1993. Notice of this determination was published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 on November 23, 1993.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Hilo International Airport study contains a proposed noise compatibility program comprised of actions designed
for phased implementation by airport management and adjacent jurisdictions from the date of study completion to
the year 1996. It was requested that the FAA evaluate and approve this material as a noise compatibility program as
described in section 104(b) of the Act. The FAA began its review of the program on November 4, 1993 and was required by
a provision of the Act to approve or disapprove the program within 180 days (other than the use of new flight procedures
for noise control). Failure to approve or disapprove such program within the 180-day period shall be deemed to be an
approval of such program.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The submitted program contained ten (10) proposed actions for noise mitigation on and off the airport. The FAA completed
its review and determined that the procedural and substantive requirements of the Act and FAR Part 150 have been satisfied.
The overall program, therefore, was approved by the Assistant Administration for Airports effective May 3, 1994.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Outright approval was granted for eight (8) of the ten (10) of the specific program elements. Approved program measures
include: Encourage relocation of military training operations; Displace Runway 8 landing threshold; Study sound
attenuation barrier; Study possible land exchanges with Hawaiian Home Lands; Monitor development proposals in
the Hilo International Airport environs; Annually monitor aircraft noise levels and operations at Hilo International
Airport; Conduct annual public information meetings on the progress of the part 150 program; Disclose airport noise
impacts for all real estate transfers; and Provide sound attenuation for impacted residences and public use structures.
One measure approved in part: Sound attenuation for public building approved and sound attenuation for residence
was disapproved. No action was taken on the measure to implement an informal runway use program.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
These determinations are set forth in detail in a Record of Approval endorsed by the Administrator on May 3, 1994. The
Record of Approval, as well as other evaluation materials and the documents comprising the submittal, are available
for review at the FAA office listed above and at the administrative offices of the State of Hawaii.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 Section 1012(b) of the ISTEA (Pub. L. 102&hyph;240, 105 Stat. 1914) authorizes the Secretary of Transportation (the
Secretary) to create a Pilot Program by entering into cooperative agreements with up to five State or local governments
or other public authorities, to establish, maintain, and monitor congestion pricing pilot projects. Three of these
agreements may involve the use of tolls on the Interstate System notwithstanding 23 U.S.C. 129, as amended, and 301.
A maximum of $25 million is authorized for each of the fiscal years 1992 through 1997 to be made available to carry out
program requirements. Not more than $15 million can be made available each fiscal year to fund any single cooperative
agreement. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In advance of completing its plan for implementing this program, the FHWA published a 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 notice on May 29, 1992 (57 FR 22857), which presented general information about the Pilot Program and solicited public
comment on a number of implementation issues [Docket No. 92&hyph;94]. The comment period closed on June 29, 1992.
The FHWA published the initial solicitation for the Pilot Program in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 on November 24, 1992 (57 FR 55293). The solicitation period closed on January 25, 1993. The results of the first solicitation
were summarized in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 on June 16, 1993 (58 FR 33293). The June 16 notice also extended the solicitation period until October 14, 1993. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
Extension of Solicitation
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Because the proposals received in response to the June 16 notice did not adequately meet the criteria for selection
as pilot projects at this time, the FHWA has determined that the goals of the Pilot Program can best be advanced if the
solicitation period is held open until further notice to encourage development of promising congestion pricing
experiments. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
To promote development of projects, the FHWA 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
will use a small amount of Pilot Program funds 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to assist a limited number of areas in carrying out pre-project activities, such as the development of public-involvement
programs and activities designed to overcome institutional barriers to implementing congestion pricing. In addition,
more attention will be given to parking pricing and other pricing experiments that would be supportive of future highway
congestion pricing applications. The FHWA's program activities, in cooperation with other Federal agencies, will
focus on nurturing the development of market pricing experiments in areas showing the most promise for implementing
congestion pricing pilot projects.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Proposals to price high-occupancy vehicle (HOV) lanes to allow their use by single-occupant vehicles (HOV Buy-In)
have previously not been accepted for inclusion in the Pilot Program. The HOV Buy-In pricing concept was discussed
extensively at a recent National Academy of Sciences (NAS) symposium on congestion pricing. The sense of those discussions
was that in some circumstances this application of pricing should be considered on an experimental basis, and under
limited circumstances. The thinking was that this kind of pricing would improve the use of available capacity and
could be a way of introducing the notion of variable pricing for highways to the public. In response to these discussions,
and in anticipation of a likely NAS recommendation for experimentation with this type of pricing in its forthcoming
report on congestion pricing, the FHWA has decided to allow consideration of HOV Buy-In projects during this solicitation.
Further, because substantial economic benefits are likely to result from expediting truck movements in congested
urban corridors, the FHWA is also seeking a project proposal that would allow commercial freight vehicles to pay a
price for the right to use an underutilized HOV lane, either along with an HOV Buy-In for passenger vehicles, or as a
commercial freight vehicle Buy-In alone. Such proposals would have to ensure that the safety and operational efficiency
of the HOV lanes are not compromised. Proposals should address such considerations as size and type of commercial
freight vehicle in relation to the particular HOV lane design characteristics (e.g., HOV lanes must be barrier separated);
likely enforcement problems; lane capacity and traffic flow; and effects on corridor travel patterns. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In order to protect the integrity of HOV programs, the FHWA will give priority to those HOV Buy-In proposals where it
is clear that an HOV lane is underutilized and where local officials can demonstrate that the experiment would not
undermine a long-term regional strategy to increase ride-sharing. In addition, areas proposing HOV Buy-In projects
are encouraged to use revenues from the project to promote improved transit service or other programs that will encourage
transit use and ride-sharing. Priority will also be given to proposals which will result in early implementation
of pricing activities. To gain acceptance as a pilot project, an HOV Buy-In project must incorporate the use of electronic
pricing technologies, HOV time-savings must be maintained, and enforcement authorities should have input to any
proposal. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Proposals for funding of pre-project activities shall be submitted through the local Metropolitan Planning Organization
and State Department of Transportation to the FHWA through the appropriate Federal Highway Division Administrator.
Proposals will be reviewed by an Interagency Review Group comprised of representatives of FHWA, the Office of the
Secretary of Transportation, Federal Transit Administration, Environmental Protection Agency, and Department
of Energy. Based on this review, a limited number of applicants will be invited to enter into negotiations with FHWA
to develop a cooperative agreement under which the pre-project activities will be carried out. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Proposals for congestion pricing project implementation using one of the four remaining Pilot Program slots shall
be submitted via the same route. The selection criteria contained in the FHWA's

The BN seeks a waiver of compliance from certain Sections of 49 CFR part 229, Locomotive Safety Standards, for locomotives
used in switching service in Memphis, Tennessee.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The BN is seeking a waiver of compliance with 49 CFR 229.123 of the Locomotive Safety Standards_Pilots, snowplows,
end plates_for locomotives used in the Tennessee Yard Terminal, Memphis. The BN is requesting that it be permitted
to increase the height of the locomotive pilot above the top of the rail from the maximum allowable 6 inches to 9 inches.
The BN states that with the pilots at the maximum height of 6 inches above the top of rail, both the pilot and the retarder
equipment are being damaged when the locomotives go through the hump yard. This waiver would only apply to locomotives
used exclusively for hump service in the Tennessee Yard Terminal.

locomotives used in switching service in all of its hump yards.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The UP is seeking a waiver of compliance with &sect;229.123 of the Locomotive Safety Standards_Pilots, snowplows,
end plates_for locomotives used in switch service in the hump yards located at Hinkle, Oregon, North Platte, Nebraska,
North Little Rock, Arkansas, Ft. Worth, Texas, Pocatello, Idaho, and Los Angeles, California.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The UP and the Missouri Pacific Railroad Company (MP) collectively own or lease 100 percent of the affected locomotives
used in the hump yards. The UP is requesting that it be permitted to increase the height of the locomotive pilot above
the top of the rail from the maximum permissible 6 inches to 83/4 inches in order to achieve sufficient clearance and
avoid damage to the locomotives and retarders. With the pilots at the maximum permissible height of 6 inches above
the top of rail, the pilot and the retarder equipment are being damaged when the locomotives go through the hump yard.
This waiver would only apply to locomotives used exclusively in switching service in the hump yards. Further, the
UP states that safety of its operations in hump yards will not be adversely affected. All affected locomotives will
be brought back to the maximum permissible clearance of 6 inches before used in any other service.

Metra is seeking a waiver of compliance with 49 CFR 229.133 Locomotive Conspicuity, Minimum Standards for Auxiliary
External Lights (ditch lights), for passenger equipment used in the Chicago metropolitan area.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Metra owns the former Rock Island, Milwaukee Road and Illinois Central Commuter service and oversees, through the
purchase of service agreements, the Chicago and North Western, Norfolk Southern (Southwest Service) and Burlington
Northern Computer Service. Metra has a fleet of 134 passenger locomotives, 7 switcher locomotives, 165 electric
multiple unit locomotives (M.U. locomotives) and 161 non-M.U. control cab locomotives (cab car) which fall under
the jurisdiction of 49 CFR 229.133. Metra has developed schedules and placed material purchase orders to install
ditch lights on its passenger equipment.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Metra is seeking a waiver from the interim rule requirement for the minimum height of the ditch lights on 165 MU locomotives,
which are currently being rebuilt. Section 229.133(b)(1) requires that two ditch lights shall be placed at the front
of the locomotive, not less than 36 inches nor more than 84 inches above top of rail. Metra says that the ditch lights
will be installed at a height of 25 inches above top of the rail, which is below the FRA minimum of 36 inches. Further,
at this height the lights have proven to be very conspicuous. Metra states that a higher location on these MU locomotives
would present an unnecessary financial burden that would not measurably enhance or improve the conspicuity of the
ditch lights. The burden would be attributable to extensive carbody and control cab modifications necessary to adapt
the car body structure for the mounting of recessed ditch lights at the 36 inch minimum height. Further, Metra states
that one route is parallelled on both sides by public streets, and separated by concrete barriers. If the height of
the ditch lights was raised above 25 inches above top of rail, the lights would be directed into the line of sight of vehicles
traveling next to the track and could contribute to motor vehicle accidents.

In accordance with 49 CFR 211.9 and 211.41, notice is hereby given that the Federal Railroad Administration (FRA)
has received from Texas Parks and Wildlife Department of request for waivers of compliance with certain requirements
of Federal regulations. The petition is described below, including the regulatory provisions involved, the nature

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The TPWX on behalf of the Texas State Railroad (TSR) seeks a waiver of compliance from certain Sections of 49 CFR part
231, Railroad Safety Appliance Standards. The TSR is requesting a permanent waiver of the provisions of 49 CFR 231.29
``Road Locomotives with corner stairways'' which requires that road locomotives with corner stairways must be equipped
with (a) uncoupling levers that can be operated safely from the bottom stairway opening step as well as from the ground
level, and (b) the vertical handholds and horizontal and handholds as prescribed in 231.30(e) and (g). The TSR is also
requesting a waiver of 49 CFR 231.30 ``Locomotives used in switching service'' which requires that each locomotive
used in switching service be equipped with four side switching steps, each of which has a minimum width of 24 inches
and a minimum depth of 12 inches for locomotives built after March 31, 1977, and for locomotives built prior to April
1, 1977, a minimum width of 18 inches and the minimum depth of 8 inches. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The locomotive TSRR number 1 for which this waiver is requested is a 45-ton center cab, industrial switcher type locomotive.
This type of locomotive has a side switching step and ladder configuration located at each of the four corners which
are narrower and of less depth than those required by the Safety Appliance Standards. The railroad states that the
construction of this locomotive does not permit it to be retrofitted with side switching steps different than it currently
possesses. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Locomotive TSRR number 1 is used primarily in shop areas to move dead locomotives and cars in the work area. Occasionally
when the road locomotives are out of service, it is used on a light work train. The switchman will mount or dismount the
locomotive only when it is stopped.

B.A.T. Incorporated, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Receipt of Petition for Temporary Exemption From 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standard No. 208 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
B.A.T. (``Battery Automated Transportation'') Inc. of West Valley City, Utah, has petitioned to be exempted from
Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standard No. 208 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Occupant Crash Protection 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
for Geo Metro sedans that it converts to electric power. The basis of the petition is that an exemption will facilitate
the development and field evaluation of low-emission motor vehicles. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Notice of receipt of the petition is published in accordance with agency regulations on the subject and does not represent
any judgment of the agency on the merits of the petition (49 CFR 555.7(a)). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Petitioner has already been excused from compliance with the crash test provision of Standard No. 208 by NHTSA Temporary
Exemption No. 93&hyph;3 which expires August 1, 1995 (see 58 FR 45549). Although that exemption is not vehicle-specific
by its terms, petition had been made only on behalf of 1993 model Ford Ranger pickup trucks to be converted to electric
power. Thus, rather than providing the petitioner with an interpretation that the current exemption extends to sedans
as well as pickups, NHTSA concluded that the public should be offered an opportunity to comment on B.A.T.'s latest
request. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As before, the basis of the petition is that a temporary exemption would facilitate the development and field evaluation
of a low-emission motor vehicle, as provided by 49 CFR 555.6(c). The petitioner will not manufacture more than 2,500
vehicles during any 12-month period that the exemption is in effect. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Although the Geo Metro is certified by its original manufacturer as conforming with all applicable Federal motor
vehicle safety standards, petitioner has determined that the vehicles may not conform, after their modification,
with ``the requirements of crash tests of'' Standard No. 208 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Occupant Crash Protection. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The petitioner intends to make arrangements with the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory to do computer simulated
crash testing. Any changes that are shown to be necessary will be incorporated in all future versions ``and will voluntarily
be retrofitted in earlier units.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Although the petitioner has not provided specific arguments that an exemption would not unreasonably degrade the
safety of the vehicle, it believes that electric vehicles are safer because they carry no flammable substances and
do not have ``a very hot catalytic converter close to the gasoline tank.'' B.A.T. conversions do not ``emit hydrogen
gas from the batteries due to the addition of hydrocaps which catalyze any hydrogen gas formed when charging or discharging.''
Further, ``BAT 'Ultra Force' catalyst sharply reduces any gassing that might otherwise occur.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Finally, the petitioner argued, granting the exemption would be in the public interest and consistent with the National
Traffic and Motor Vehicle Safety Act because the vehicles ``are non polluting *&blank;*&blank;* and therefore can
be a major means of improving the quality of the air we breathe.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Interested persons are invited to submit comments on the petition described above. Comments should refer to the Docket
number and be submitted to: Docket Section, National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, room 5109, 400 Seventh
Street, SW, Washington, DC 20590. It is requested but not required that 10 copies be submitted.

Background
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Under section 108(c)(3)(A)(i)(I) of the National Traffic and Motor Vehicle Safety Act (the Act), 15 U.S.C. 1397(c)(3)(A)(i)(I),
a motor vehicle that was not originally manufactured to conform to all applicable Federal motor vehicle safety standards
shall be refused admission into the United States on and after January 31, 1990, unless NHTSA has determined that the
motor vehicle is substantially similar to a motor vehicle originally manufactured for importation into and sale
in the United States, certified under section 114 of the Act, and of the same model year as the model of the motor vehicle
to be compared, and is capable of being readily modified to conform to all applicable Federal motor vehicle safety
standards. Where there is no substantially similar U.S.-certified motor vehicle, section 108(c)(3)(A)(i)(II)
of the Act, 15 U.S.C. 1397(c)(3)(A)(i)(II), permits a nonconforming motor vehicle to be admitted into the United
States if its safety features comply with, or are capable of being modified to comply with, all applicable Federal
motor vehicle safety standards based on destructive test data or such other evidence as NHTSA determines to be adequate.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Petitions for eligibility determinations may be submitted by either manufacturers or importers who have registered

J.K. Motors, Inc. of Kingsville Maryland (``J.K.'') (Registered Importer No. R&hyph;90&hyph;006) has petitioned
NHTSA to determine whether non-U.S.-certified 1989 Honda (Acura) Legend passenger cars are eligible for importation
into the United States. The vehicle which J.K. believes is substantially similar is the 1989 Honda (Acura) Legend
that Honda Motor Company Ltd. manufactured for importation into, and sale in the United States, and certified as conforming
to all applicable Federal motor vehicle safety standards.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The petitioner stated that it carefully compared the non-U.S.-certified 1989 Honda (Acura) Legend to its U.S.-certified
counterpart, and found the two vehicles to be substantially similar with respect to compliance with most applicable
Federal motor vehicle safety standards.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
J.K. submitted information with its petition intended to demonstrate that the non-U.S.-certified 1989 Honda (Acura)
Legend, as originally manufactured, conforms to many Federal motor vehicle safety standards in the same manner as
its U.S.-certified counterpart, or is capable of being readily modified to conform to those standards.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Specifically, the petitioner claims that the non-U.S.-certified 1989 Honda (Acura) Legend is identical to its U.S.-certified
counterpart with respect to compliance with Standard Nos. 102

Under section 108(c)(3)(A)(i) of the National Traffic and Motor Vehicle Safety Act (the Act), 15 U.S.C. 1397(c)(3)(A)(i),
a motor vehicle that was not originally manufactured to conform to all applicable Federal motor vehicle safety standards
shall be refused admission into the United States on and after January 31, 1990, unless NHTSA has determined that the
motor vehicle is substantially similar to a motor vehicle originally manufactured for importation into and sale
in the United States, certified under section 114 of the Act, and of the same model year as the model of the motor vehicle
to be compared, and is capable of being readily modified to conform to all applicable Federal motor vehicle safety
standards.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Petitions for eligibility determinations may be submitted by either manufacturers or importers who have registered
with NHTSA pursuant to 49 CFR part 592. As specified in 49 CFR 593.7, NHTSA publishes notice in the

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
J.K. Motors, Inc. of Kingsville, Maryland (``J.K.'') (Registered Importer R&hyph;90&hyph;006) has petitioned
NHTSA to determine whether 1993 Jaguar Sovereign passenger cars that were not originally manufactured to comply
with all applicable Federal motor vehicle safety standards are eligible for importation into the United States.
The vehicle which J.K. believes is substantially similar is the 1993 Jaguar Sovereign manufactured for importation
into and sale in the United States and certified by its manufacturer, Jaguar Cars Ltd., as conforming to all applicable
Federal motor vehicle safety standards
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The petitioner states that it has carefully compared the non-U.S.-certified version of the Jaguar Sovereign to its
U.S.-certified counterpart, and found the two vehicles to be substantially similar with respect to most applicable
Federal motor vehicle safety standards.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
J.K. submitted information with its petition intended to demonstrate that the non-U.S.-certified version of the
1993 Jaguar Sovereign, as originally manufactured, conforms to many Federal motor vehicle safety standards in the
same manner as its U.S.-certified counterpart, or is capable of being readily modified to conform to those standards.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Specifically, the petitioner claims that the non-U.S.-certified 1993 Jaguar Sovereign is identical to its U.S.-certified
counterpart with respect to compliance with Standard Nos. 102

Under section 108(c)(3)(A)(i) of the National Traffic and Motor Vehicle Safety Act (the Act), 15 U.S.C. 1397(c)(3)(A)(i),
a motor vehicle that was not originally manufactured to conform to all applicable Federal motor vehicle safety standards
shall be refused admission into the United States on and after January 31, 1990, unless NHTSA has determined that the
motor vehicle is substantially similar to a motor vehicle originally manufactured for importation into and sale
in the United States, certified under section 114 of the Act, and of the same model year as the model of the motor vehicle
to be compared, and is capable of being readily modified to conform to all applicable Federal motor vehicle safety
standards.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Petitions for eligibility determinations may be submitted by either manufacturers or importers who have registered
with NHTSA pursuant to 49 CFR part 592. As specified in 49 CFR 593.7, NHTSA publishes notice in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

Champagne Imports, Inc. of Lansdale, Pennsylvania (Registered Importer R&hyph;90&hyph;009) has petitioned NHTSA
to determine whether 1991 Mercedes-Benz 230E (Model ID 124.023) passenger cars are eligible for importation into
the United States. The vehicle which Champagne believes is substantially similar is the 1991 Mercedes-Benz 300E.
Champagne has submitted information indicating that Daimler Benz A.G., the company that manufactured the 1991 Mercedes-Benz
300E, certified that vehicle as conforming to all applicable Federal motor vehicle safety standards and offered
it for sale in the United States.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The petitioner contends that it carefully compared the 230E to the 300E, and found the two models to be substantially
similar with respect to compliance with most applicable Federal motor vehicle safety standards.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Champagne submitted information with its petition intended to demonstrate that the 1991 model 230E, as originally
manufactured, conforms to many Federal motor vehicle safety standards in the same manner as the 1991 model 300E that
was offered for sale in the United States, or is capable of being readily modified to conform to those standards.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Specifically, the petitioner claims that the 1991 model 230E is identical to the certified 1991 model 300E with respect
to compliance with Standards Nos. 102

Background
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
Under section 108(c)(3)(A)(i) of the National Traffic and Motor Vehicle Safety Act (the Act), 15 U.S.C. 1397(c)(3)(A)(i),
a motor vehicle that was not originally manufactured to conform to all applicable Federal motor vehicle safety standards
must be refused admission into the United States on and after January 31, 1990, unless NHTSA has determined that the
motor vehicle is substantially similar to a motor vehicle originally manufactured for importation into and sale
in the United States, certified under section 114 of the Act, and of the same model year as the model of the motor vehicle
to be compared, and is capable of being readily modified to conform to all applicable Federal motor vehicle safety
standards.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Petitions for eligibility determinations may be submitted by either manufacturers or importers who have registered
with NHTSA pursuant to 49 CFR part 592. As specified in 49 CFR 593.7, NHTSA publishes notice in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 of each petition that it receives, and affords interested persons an opportunity to comment on the petition. At the
close of the comment period, NHTSA determines, on the basis of the petition and any comments that it has received, whether
the vehicle is eligible for importation. The agency then publishes this determination in the

Champagne Imports, Inc. of Lansdale, Pennsylvania (Registered Importer R&hyph;90&hyph;009) has petitioned NHTSA
to determine whether 1993 Mercedes-Benz 200E (Model ID 124.019) passenger cars are eligible for importation into
the United States. The vehicle which Champagne believes is substantially similar is the 1993 Mercedes-Benz 300E,
which was manufactured for importation into, and sale in the United States, and certified by its manufacturer, Daimler
Benz A.G., as conforming to all applicable Federal motor vehicle safety standards.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The petitioner contends that it carefully compared the 1993 model 200E to the 1993 model 300E, and found the two vehicles
to be substantially similar with respect to compliance with most applicable Federal motor vehicle safety standards.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Champagne submitted information with its petition intended to demonstrate that the 1993 model 200E, as originally
manufactured, conforms to many Federal motor vehicle safety standards in the same manner as the 1993 model 300E, or
is capable of being readily modified to conform to those standards.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Specifically, the petitioner claims that the 1993 model 200E is identical to the 1993 model 300E with respect to compliance
with Standard Nos. 102

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
Under section 108(c)(3)(A)(i)(I) of the National Traffic and Motor Vehicle Safety Act (the Act), 15 U.S.C. 1397 (c)(3)(A)(i)(I),
a motor vehicle that was not originally manufactured to conform to all applicable Federal motor vehicle safety standards
shall be refused admission into the United States on and after January 31, 1990, unless NHTSA has determined that the
motor vehicle is substantially similar to a motor vehicle originally manufactured for importation into and sale
in the United States, certified under section 114 of the Act, and of the same model year as the model of the motor vehicle
to be compared, and is capable of being readily modified to conform to all applicable Federal motor vehicle safety
standards. Where there is no substantially similar U.S.-certified motor vehicle, section 108(c)(3)(A)(i)(II)
of the Act, 15 U.S.C. 1397(c)(3)(A)(i)(II), permits a nonconforming motor vehicle to be admitted into the United
States if its safety features comply with, or are capable of being modified to comply with, all applicable Federal
motor vehicle safety standards based on destructive test data or such other evidence as NHTSA determines to be adequate.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Petitions for eligibility determinations may be submitted by either manufacturers or importers who have registered
with NHTSA pursuant to 49 CFR part 592. As specified in 49 CFR 593.7, NHTSA publishes notice in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
of each petition that it receives, and affords interested persons an opportunity to comment on the petition. At the
close of the comment period, NHTSA determines, on the basis of the petition and any comments that it has received, whether
the vehicle is eligible for importation. The agency then publishes this determination in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register.

Europa International, Inc. of Santa Fe, New Mexico (Registered Importer No. R&hyph;91&hyph;002) petitioned NHTSA
to determine whether 1990, 1991, 1992, and 1994 Mercedes-Benz Gelaendewagen 300GE (long wheel base Type 463) MPVs
are eligible for importation into the United States. NHTSA published notice of the petition on March 29, 1994 (59 FR
14708) to afford an opportunity for public comment. As described in that notice, the petitioner claimed that 1990,
1991, 1992, and 1994 Mercedes-Benz Gelaendewagen 300GE (long wheel base Type 463) MPVs have safety features that
comply with Standard Nos. 102

<DOCTITLE>U.S. Electricar, Inc.; Receipt of Petition for Renewal of Temporary Exemption From Five Federal Motor Vehicle Safety
Standards </DOCTITLE>
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
U.S. Electricar Corporation of Sebastopol, California, has petitioned for renewal of NHTSA Temporary Exemption
No. 92&hyph;3 from five Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards (see 57 FR 30997). At the time the exemption was granted,
the petitioner was known as Solar Electric Engineering, Inc. As of the date of its petition, 70 vehicles had been sold
under the Exemption. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Exemption No. 93&hyph;2 expires on June 1, 1994. The petition for renewal of the exemption was received on March 31,
1994. In accordance with agency regulations, when a petition for renewal has been filed not later than 60 days before
the termination date of an exemption, the exemption does not terminate until the Administrator grants or denies the
petition for renewal (49 CFR 555.8(e)). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Notice of receipt of the petition is published in accordance with agency regulations on the subject and does not represent
any judgment of the agency on the merits of the petition (49 CFR 555.7(a)). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The basis of U.S. Electricar's original petition and its petition for renewal is that a temporary exemption would
facilitate the development and field evaluation of a low emission motor vehicle. Renewal is sought for the same portions
of the same five standards as are covered by the original exemption. These are paragraphs S4.2 and S4.3 of Standard
No. 103 Windshield Defrosting and Defogging Systems, ``the service brake requirements of S5.1 and the parking brake
performance requirements of S5.2'' of Standard No. 105 Hydraulic brake Systems, paragraph S3.3 of Standard No. 201
Occupant Protection in Interior Impact, Standard No. 204 Steering Control Rearward Displacement, and paragraphs
S4.1.4.1 and S4.2.2 of Standard No. 208 Occupant Crash Protection. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under the original exemption, petitioner converted Ford Escorts, Chevrolet S&hyph;10 pickup trucks ``and other
FMVSS-compliant vehicles'' to electric power. It has now substituted conversions of Geo Prizm sedans for Ford Escorts.
Although the vehicles to be converted are certified by their original manufacturers to conform to all applicable
Federal motor vehicle safety standards, the modifications that Electricar performs add weight to the converted
vehicle and may affect its compliance with the standards. Until it has satisfied itself that the conversions conform,
petitioner has requested appropriate exemptions. The modifications that petitioner performs include removal
of the internal combustion engine and fuel system modification or replacement of the transmission and installation
of an electric propulsion system and battery pack. Springs, shock absorbers, tires and other components are removed
and replaced with new, heavier-duty equipment as required to accommodate the weight of the battery pack added to the
vehicle. An electric heater defroster is installed and an electric vacuum pump for the vacuum-assisted brake system
is added to the vehicle. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The electric vacuum pump is intended to improve brake performance and has been developed during the term of the current
exemption. Petitioner has also implemented a ``Safety Development Program'' using vehicle crashworthiness computer
simulation and physical testing. Preliminary results from a frontal barrier crash test of the S&hyph;10 conversion
indication compliance with Standard No. 208 under these conditions ``without ejection of batteries or spillage
of battery electrolyte.'' The company has also been field testing an electrical safety system which ``ensures that
the primary battery pack remains electrically isolated from the vehicle chassis, and de-energizes the system''
if the condition is violated. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Electricar asserts that an exemption would not unreasonably degrade motor vehicle safety as electric vehicles are
intended for urban use and are therefore generally operated at lower speeds. Under a renewed exemption the company
will continue its safety development and field evaluations with a view to ensuring that its vehicles fully comply
before the end of the renewed exemption period. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Finally, the petitioner argues that renewal of the exemption would be in the public interest and consistent with the
objectives of the National Traffic and Motor Vehicle Safety Act. Its vehicles reduce air pollution at street level
and lessen the dependence of the United States on importation of petroleum. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Interested persons are invited to submit comments on the petition described above. Comments should refer to the Docket
number and be submitted to: Docket Section, National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, room 5109, 400 Seventh
Street, SW., Washington, DC 20590. It is requested but not required that 10 copies be submitted.

<SUMMARY>
<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 -->
SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Technology-Related Assistance for Individuals with 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Disabilities Act of 1988, as amended (the Act), directs the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Secretary to make site visits to States with development grants 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
under Title I of the Act prior to funding extension grants for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the fourth and fifth years of the projects. The statute further 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
directs the Secretary to solicit public comment about the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
performance of the projects. In 1994, the Department will make 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
site visits to Delaware, Georgia, Hawaii, Louisiana, Missouri, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Montana, New Hampshire and South Carolina during the end of May 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and in June. Each of these States is in the final year of a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
three-year development grant project authorized under Title I of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the Act and is eligible to apply for a two-year extension award. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The purpose of the Act is to establish comprehensive, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
consumer-responsive statewide systems of technology-related 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
assistance for persons of all ages with disabilities. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
extension awards will be governed by the provisions of the Act, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
which was recently amended by the Technology-Related Assistance 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for Individuals with Disabilities Act Amendments of 1994. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Act as amended includes greater emphasis on systems change, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
services to minority populations, and geographic factors for the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
distribution of resources, and also established a program of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
protection and advocacy services designed to increase access to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
technology, which all projects must support. The Secretary is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
soliciting public comment from individuals with disabilities and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
their family members, guardians, advocates and authorized 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
representatives, public service providers and private service 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
providers, educators and related services personnel, technology 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
experts, employers, and other appropriate individuals and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
entities regarding projects under the Act in the eight States 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The application of new technologies to the manufacturing process is key to the restoration of American competitiveness.
In a 1989 Memorandum of Understanding, the Department of Education, the Department of Labor, the Department of Defense,
and the Department of Commerce agreed that there was a national need to train multi-skilled machine technicians capable
of installing, integrating, maintaining, diagnosing, repairing, and modifying technologically advanced equipment
systems. However, high-technology manufacturing systems can be implemented only where the skills exist to use them
at peak efficiency. At present, this type of skill training is in short supply and the lack of these skills is a major
hindrance to increasing industrial automation in the United States. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In fiscal year 1993, the House Appropriations Committee Report indicated that the Department should initiate a demonstration
program for critical technologies, as authorized by section 215 of the National Defense Authorization Act of 1989,
which also provided for this type of demonstration. (H.R. Rep. No. 708, 102nd Cong., 2nd Sess. 160 (1993)). The competition
to be conducted under this priority notice is designed to address national skill shortages in advanced skills technologies
for manufacturing within the American machine tool industry. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Secretary hopes that this effort will serve to encourage the establishment of partnerships between vocational
education institutions and industry, which, in turn, should serve to bring new ideas and concepts from the research
laboratory to the manufacturing floor. The Secretary recognizes the importance of assisting manufacturing enterprises
to utilize new manufacturing technologies and to define the training and educational components necessary for successful
implementation of those new technologies. Models developed under this competition will enable innovative manufacturing
enterprises to become more technologically competitive both at home and abroad. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Additionally, this program can help further the purposes of the National Education Goals. Specifically, the manufacturing
technologies priority announced by this notice directly supports Goal 6, which states that by the year 2000, every
adult American will be literate and will possess the knowledge and skills necessary to compete in a global economy
and exercise the rights and responsibilities of citizenship.

Waiver of Proposed Rulemaking 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In accordance with section 431(b)(2)(A) of the General Education Provisions Act (20 U.S.C. 1232(b)(2)(A)) and the
Administrative Procedure Act (5 U.S.C. 553), it is the practice of the Secretary to offer interested parties the opportunity
to comment on proposed regulations and priorities. However, for the following reasons, the Secretary is publishing
the absolute priority for manufacturing technologies demonstration projects without seeking public comment.
In FY 1993, the Department awarded a contract for the purpose of carrying out a manufacturing technologies demonstration
project under the cooperative demonstration authority. Similarly, the Department initially planned to award a
contract for this same purpose in FY 1994. However, the Department recently determined that a contract cannot be used
for funding manufacturing technologies demonstration projects in FY 1994. Since the FY 1993 appropriations available
for this competition must be obligated by September 30, 1994, solicitation of public comment on the absolute priority
for this FY 1994 manufacturing technologies competition would not allow sufficient time to publish the priority
in final form, announce and conduct the competition, and award the funds by September 30, 1994. Therefore, the Secretary
finds that solicitation of public comments would be impracticable and contrary to the public interest under 5 U.S.C.
553(b)(B).

Instructions for Part III_Budget Narrative 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The budget narrative should explain, justify, and, if needed, clarify your budget summary. For each line item (personnel,
fringe benefits, travel, etc.) in your budget, explain why it is there and how you computed the costs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Please limit this section to no more than five pages. Be sure that each page of your application is numbered consecutively.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
Instructions for Part IV_Program Narrative 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The program narrative will comprise the largest portion of your application. This part is where you spell out the who,
what, when, where, why, and how of your proposed project. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Although you will not have a form to fill out for your narrative, there is a format. This format is the selection criteria.
Because your application will be reviewed and rated by a review panel on the basis of the selection criteria, your narrative
should follow the order and format of the criteria. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Before preparing your application, you should carefully read the legislation and regulations of the program, eligibility
requirements, information on any priority set by the Secretary, and the selection criteria for this competition.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Your program narrative should be clear, concise, and to the point. Begin the narrative with a one page abstract or summary
of your proposed project. Then describe the project in detail, addressing each selection criterion in order. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Secretary strongly requests you limit the program narrative to no more than 30 double-spaced, typed pages (on
one side only), although the Secretary will consider your application if it is longer. Be sure to number consecutively

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
ALL
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 pages in your application. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
You may include supporting documentation as appendices. Be sure that this material is concise and pertinent to this
program competition. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
You are advised that: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(a) The Department considers only information contained in the application in ranking applications for funding
consideration. Letters of support sent separately from the formal application package are not considered in the
review by the technical review panels. (EDGAR Sec. 75.217) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) The technical review panel evaluates each application solely on the basis of the established technical review
criteria. Letters of support contained in the application will strengthen the application only insofar as they contain
commitments which pertain to the established technical review criteria, such as commitment and resources.

Appendix C 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Potential applicants frequently direct questions to officials of the Department regarding application notices
and programmatic and administrative regulations governing various direct grant programs. To assist potential
applicants the Department has assembled the following most commonly asked questions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Q. Can we get an extension of the deadline? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A. No. A closing date may be changed only under extraordinary circumstances. Any change must be announced in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 and apply to all applications. Waivers for individual applications cannot be granted regardless of the circumstances.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Q. How many copies of the application should I submit and must they be bound? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A. Our new policy calls for an original and six copies to be submitted. The binding of applications is optional. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Q. We just missed the deadline for the XXX competition. May we submit under another competition? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A. Yes, however, the likelihood of success is not good. A properly prepared application must meet the requirements
of the competition to which it is submitted. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Q. I'm not sure which competition is most appropriate for my project. What should I do? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A. We are happy to discuss any questions with you and provide clarification on the unique elements of the various competitions.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Q. Will you help us prepare our application? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A. We are happy to provide general program information. Clearly, it would not be appropriate for staff to participate
in the actual writing of an application, but we can respond to specific questions about application requirements,
evaluation criteria, and the priorities. Applicants should understand that preapplication consultation is not
required, nor will it in any way influence the success of an application. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Q. When will I find out if I'm going to be funded? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A. You can expect to receive notification within 3 to 4 months of the application closing date, depending on the number
of applications received and the number of competitions with closing dates at about the same time. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Q. Once my application has been reviewed by the review panel, can you tell me the outcome? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A. No. Every year we are called by a number of applicants who have legitimate reasons for needing to know the outcome
of the review prior to official notification. Some applicants need to make job decisions, some need to notify a local
school district, etc. Regardless of the reason, because final funding decisions have not been made at that point,
we cannot share information about the review with anyone. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Q. Will my application be returned if I am not funded? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A. We no longer return unsuccessful applications. Thus, applicants should retain at least one copy of the application.

<!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Q. Can I obtain copies of reviewers' comments? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A. Upon written request, reviewers' comments will be mailed to unsuccessful applicants. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Q. Is travel allowed under these projects? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A. Travel associated with carrying out the project is allowed. Because we will request the project directors and evaluators
of funded projects to attend an annual project directors meeting, you should include annual trips for each to Washington,
D.C., in the travel budget. Travel to conferences is sometimes allowed when it is for purposes of dissemination. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Q. If my application receives high scores from the reviewers, does that mean that I will receive funding? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A. Not necessarily. It is often the case that the number of applications scored highly by the reviewers exceeds the
dollars available for funding projects under a particular competition. The order of selection, which is based on
the scores of all the applications and other relevant factors, determines the applications that can be funded. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Q. What happens during negotiations? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A. During negotiations technical and budget issues may be raised. These are issues that have been identified during
the panel and staff reviews that require clarification. Sometimes issues are stated as ``conditions.'' These are
issues that have been identified as so critical that the award cannot be made unless those conditions are met. Questions
may also be raised about the proposed budget. Generally, these issues are raised because there is inadequate justification
or explanation of a particular budget item, or because the budget item seems unimportant to the successful completion
of the project. If you are asked to make changes that you feel could seriously affect the project's success, you may
provide reasons for not making the changes or provide alternative suggestions. Similarly, if proposed budget reductions
will, in your opinion, seriously affect the project activities, you may explain why and provide additional justification
for the proposed expenses. An award cannot be made until all negotiation issues have been resolved. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Q. How do I provide an assurance? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A. Except for SF&hyph;424B, ``Assurances_Non-Construction Programs,'' simply state in writing that you are meeting
a proscribed requirement. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Q. Where can copies of the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, program regulations, and Federal statutes be obtained? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A. Copies of these materials can usually be found at your local library. If not, they can be obtained from the Government
Printing Office by writing to: Superintendent of Documents, U.S. Government Printing Office, Washington, D.C.
20402. Telephone: (202) 783&hyph;3238. When requesting copies of regulations or statutes, it is helpful to use the
specific name, public law number, or part number. The material referenced in this notice should be referred to as follows:

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Q. What are the Department of Education's Program Effectiveness Panel and National Diffusion Network? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A. The Program Effectiveness Panel (PEP) is the Department of Education's primary mechanism for validating the effectiveness
of educational programs developed by schools, universities, and other agencies. The National Diffusion Network
(NDN) is a Federally funded dissemination system that helps public and private schools, colleges, and other educational
institutions improve by sharing successful education programs, products, and processes. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Regulations governing PEP and NDN are codified at 34 CFR Parts 785&hyph;789. For information about PEP, prospective
applicants may wish to read Making the Case: Evidence of Effectiveness in Schools and Classrooms, which contains
criteria and guidelines for submitting project results to PEP. This publication, as well as information about NDN,
is available from RMC Research Corporation, 1000 Market Street, Portsmouth, New Hampshire 03801. Telephone 1&hyph;800&hyph;258&hyph;0802.
RMC Research Corporation can also provide information about consultants who have conducted evaluations that have
been approved by PEP.

Request for Comments on the draft Principles for Providing  
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and Using Personal Information and their Commentary.  
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
  
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The draft Principles for Providing and Using Personal  
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Information and the associated Commentary are the first work  
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
product of the Information Infrastructure Task Force's Working  
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Group on Privacy. They are intended to update the Code of Fair  
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Information Practices that was developed in the early 1970s.  
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
While many of the Code's principles are still valid, the Code  
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
itself was developed in an era when paper records were the norm.  
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
  
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The advent of the National Information Infrastructure has  
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
caused two things to change dramatically. No longer is  
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
information usage bound by the limitations of paper_the seamless  
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
web of networks linking us to each other is creating an  
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
interactive environment in which all of the participants must  
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
share certain responsibilities. Moreover, non-governmental usage  
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
rivals the government's, and is largely unregulated.  
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
  
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The following Principles were developed with the goal of  
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
providing guidance to all participants in this new interactive  
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
world. The Working Group recognizes that the Principles cannot  
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
apply uniformly to all sectors. They must be carefully adapted to  
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
specific circumstances. Nevertheless, the developers believe that  
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the responsibilities and relationships the Principles describe  
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
are basic ones. As such, they are intended to assist legislators,  
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
regulators, and companies as they develop codes of practice.  
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
  
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Working Group invites public comment on the Principles  
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and Commentary. We are especially interested in understanding how  
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the Principles would work in this new interactive electronic  
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
environment and particularly in non-governmental settings. Are  
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
they workable? How, if at all, should they be changed? We hope  
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that those who obtain the Principles for review and comment will  
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
also share them as widely as possible with others who might be  
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
interested in them.

Preamble  
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
  
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
The United States is committed to building a National  
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Information Infrastructure (NII) to meet the information needs of  
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
its citizens. This infrastructure, essentially created by  
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
advances in technology, is expanding the level of interactivity,  
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
enhancing communication, and allowing easier access to services.  
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As a result, many more users are discovering new, previously  
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
unimagined uses for personal information. In this environment, we  
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
are challenged to develop new principles to guide participants in  
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the NII in the fair use of personal information.  
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
  
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Traditional fair information practices, developed in the age  
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of paper records, must be adapted to this new environment where  
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
information and communications are sent and received over  
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
networks on which users have very different capabilities,  
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
objectives and perspectives. Specifically, new principles must  
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
acknowledge that all members of our society (government,  
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
industry, and individual citizens), share responsibility for  
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ensuring the fair treatment of individuals in the use of personal  
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
information, whether in paper or electronic form. Moreover, the  
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
principles should recognize that the interactive nature of the  
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
NII will empower individuals to participate in protecting  
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
information about themselves. The new principles should also make  
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
it clear that this is an active responsibility requiring openness  
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
about the process, a commitment to fairness and accountability,  
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and continued attention to security. Finally, principles must  
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
recognize the need to educate all participants about the new  
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
information infrastructure and how it will affect their lives.  
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
  
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
These ``Principles for Providing and Using Personal  
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Information'' recognize the changing roles of government and  
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
industry in information collection and use. Thus they are  
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
intended to be equally applicable to public and private entities  
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that collect and use personal information. However, these  
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Principles are not intended to address all information uses and  
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
protection concerns for each segment of the economy or function  
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of government. Rather, they should provide the framework from  
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
which specialized principles can be developed.

I. General Principles for the National Information  
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Infrastructure  
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
  
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=3 -->
A. Information Privacy Principle  
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
  
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
1. Individuals are entitled to a reasonable expectation of  
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
information privacy.  
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
  
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=3 -->
B. Information Integrity Principles  
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
  
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Participants in the NII rely upon the integrity of the  
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
information it contains. It is therefore the responsibility of  
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
all participants to ensure that integrity. In particular,  
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
participants in the NII should, to the extent reasonable:  
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
  
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Ensure that information is secure, using whatever means are  
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
appropriate;  
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
  
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Ensure that information is accurate, timely, complete, and  
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
relevant for the purpose for which it is given.  
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
  
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=3 -->
II. Principle for Information Collectors (i.e. entities that  
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
collect personal information directly from the individual)  
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
  
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=3 -->
A. Collection Principle  
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
  
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Before individuals make a decision to provide personal  
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
information, they need to know how it is intended to be used, how  
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
it will be protected, and what will happen if they provide or  
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
withhold the information. Therefore, collectors of this  
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
information should:  
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
  
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. Tell the individual why they are collecting the  
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
information, what they expect it will be used for, what steps  
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
they will take to protect its confidentiality and integrity, the  
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
consequences of providing or withholding information, and any  
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
rights of redress.  
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
  
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=3 -->
III. Principles for Information Users (i.e. Information  
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Collectors and entities that obtain, process, send or store  
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
personal information)  
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
  
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=3 -->
A. Acquisition and Use Principles  
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
  
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Users of personal information must recognize and respect the  
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
stake individuals have in the use of personal information.  
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Therefore, users of personal information should:  
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
  
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Assess the impact on personal privacy of current or planned  
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
activities before obtaining or using personal information;  
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
  
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Obtain and keep only information that could reasonably be  
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
expected to support current or planned activities and use the  
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
information only for those or compatible purposes;  
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
  
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Assure that personal information is as accurate, timely,  
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
complete and relevant as necessary for the intended use;  
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
  
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=3 -->
B. Protection Principle  
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
  
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Users of personal information must take reasonable steps to  
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
prevent the information they have from being disclosed or altered  
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
improperly. Such users should:  
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
  
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. Use appropriate managerial and technical controls to  
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
protect the confidentiality and integrity of personal  
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
information.  
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
  
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=3 -->
C. Education Principle  
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
  
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
The full effect of the NII on both data use and personal  
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
privacy is not readily apparent, and individuals may not  
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
recognize how their lives can be affected by networked  
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
information. Therefore, information users should:  
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
  
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. Educate themselves, their employees, and the public about  
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
how personal information is obtained, sent, stored and protected,  
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and how these activities affect others.  
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
  
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=3 -->
D. Fairness Principles  
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
  
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Because information is used to make decisions that affect  
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
individuals, those decisions should be fair. Information users  
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
should, as appropriate:  
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
  
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Provide individuals a reasonable means to obtain, review, and  
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
correct their own information;  
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
  
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Inform individuals about any final actions taken against them  
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and provide individuals with means to redress harm resulting from  
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
improper use of personal information;  
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Allow individuals to limit the use of their personal  
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
information if the intended use is incompatible with the original  
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
purpose for which it was collected, unless that use is authorized  
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
by law.  
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
  
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=3 -->
IV. Principles for Individuals who Provide Personal  
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Information  
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
  
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=3 -->
A. Awareness Principles  
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
  
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
While information collectors have a responsibility to tell  
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
individuals why they want information about them, individuals  
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
also have a responsibility to understand the consequences of  
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
providing personal information to others. Therefore, individuals  
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
should obtain adequate, relevant information about:  
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
  
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Planned primary and secondary uses of the information;  
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
  
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Any efforts that will be made to protect the confidentiality  
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and integrity of the information;  
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
  
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Consequences for the individual of providing or withholding  
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
information;  
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
  
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Any rights of redress the individual has if harmed by  
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
improper use of the information.  
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
  
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=3 -->
B. Redress Principles  
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
  
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Individuals should be protected from harm resulting from  
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
inaccurate or improperly used personal information. Therefore,  
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
individuals should, as appropriate:  
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
  
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Be given means to obtain their information and be provided  
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
opportunity to correct inaccurate information that could harm  
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
them;  
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
  
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 the information  
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
age is clearly upon us. The ability to access, collect, store,  
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
analyze, and disseminate data at an acceptable cost has never  
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
been greater, and continuing advances in computer and  
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
telecommunications technologies, especially interactive  
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
applications, will serve to ensure that the amount of  
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
electronically stored personal information and transactional data  
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
will continue to grow at a healthy pace.

 1A The term ``NII'' refers to a seamless web of  
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
communications networks, computers, databases, and consumer  
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
electronics that will put vast amounts of information at users'  
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
fingertips.

2. Cost is, of course, the overriding factor. Continually  
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
decreasing hardware, software and networking costs allow  
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
individuals and organizations to use data in ways that were  
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
previously, in a non-electronic world, cost-prohibitive. For  
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
example, if someone were interested in building a dossier on a  
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
citizen who had lived in four different states, that dossier  
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
could have been built ``manually'' by travelling from state to  
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
state (or hiring individuals in each state) to compile public  
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
records pertaining to that individual's birth, motor vehicle  
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
registration, driver's license, real property holdings, voting,  
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
etc. This would have required, however, filling out forms, paying  
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
fees, and perhaps waiting in long lines for record searches at  
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
various state and local office buildings. In short, it could be  
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
done, but it would have been a time-consuming and costly  
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
exercise; thus, it would not be done unless the reward for  
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
building this dossier were considerable. If the ultimate goal  
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
were to collate data on thousands of individuals,analytical  
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
processing costs would also be added to the mix.  
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
  
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. Today, such a dossier can be built in a matter of minutes,  
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
at minimal cost, assuming all the needed information is on-line.

 Indeed, with the NII, the assumption is that large  
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
amounts of sensitive information will be on line, and can be  
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
accessed, perhaps without authority, by a large number of network  
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
users. With advanced networking, each link in the chain_access,  
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
collection, storage, and analysis_becomes a cost-effective method  
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of using information, as does the ability to disseminate the  
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
final collated product to others.

 1A This ease of access has led some to question  
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
whether even traditionally public information, e.g., automobile  
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
registration and drivers' licensing information, should be  
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
available on-line.

4. Such networking offers considerable benefits. The NII  
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
holds forth the promise of greater public participation in  
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
society, advances in medical treatment and research, and quick  
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
verification of critical personal information (e.g., a gun  
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
purchaser's criminal record), just to name a few. There is,  
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
however, another issue: information privacy. To the extent that  
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the ability to access, collect, store, analyze, and disseminate  
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
data has never been greater, the threat to personal information  
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
privacy has never been greater either. 1A

 1A According to the First Annual Report of the  
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Privacy Rights Clearinghouse in California (January 1994), the  
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Clearinghouse hotline received over eleven thousand calls during  
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
its first year of operation. Sixty-three percent of them related  
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to direct marketing (unsolicited mail and telephone calls),  
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
credit reporting, and Social Security Numbers. Other topics of  
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
concern included medical records, workplace monitoring,  
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
wiretapping, harassing telephone calls, merchant  
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
information-gathering practices, government records, called ID,  
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and wireless telephones.

5. The truth is, the NII will only achieve its full potential  
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
if individual privacy is properly protected. Absent such  
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
protections, individuals may be reluctant to participate in the  
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
NII, fearful that the risks to personal privacy outweigh the  
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
benefits. Citizens should not have to make that choice; rather,  
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
they should be assured that the use of personal information will  
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
be appropriately limited. The adoption of fair information  
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
principles is a critical first step in that direction.  
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
  
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
6. Although Fair Information Principles currently exist, [see  
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Advisory Committee on Automated Personal Data Systems, Records,  
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Computers and the Rights of Citizens, (Washington, D.C.,  
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Department of Health, Education and Welfare, 1973)], it is  
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
clearly time that they be rewritten to address the issues raised  
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
by our new electronic environment, as well as cover paper  
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
records. The most major concerns:  
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
  
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) It is no longer governments alone that collect and use  
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
large quantities of personal data; the private sector clearly  
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
rivals the government sector in information usage. As such, these  
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
new principles should apply to both the government and private  
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
sectors.  
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
  
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) The NII will, if it fulfills its promise, be interactive;  
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
i.e., individuals about whom data relates (so-called ``data  
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
subjects'') will become increasingly active participants,  
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
creating volumes of communicative and transactional data. To the  
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
extent that individuals are providing information about  
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
themselves, they too should have obligations when using the NII.  
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
  
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) The transport vehicles for this information (the  
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
networks) are vulnerable to abuse; thus, the reliability of the  
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
network itself becomes critical to the future success of the NII.  
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) Traditional ethical rules, long-accepted when dealing  
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
with tangible objects, are not easily applied in the new  
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
electronic environment, and all NII participants must be educated  
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in the proper use of the NII. Consider, for example, how an  
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
individual who would never trespass in the home of another might  
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
attempt to justify computer hacking as an intellectual exercise.  
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Indeed, what constitutes a proper use of the NII or NII  
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
information might not be intuitively obvious. Whether a  
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
particular use is acceptable may depend on a host of factors  
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
including, but by no means limited to, the purpose for which the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
data was collected, whether the use is compatible with that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
purpose, and whether the use is specifically authorized by law. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In such an environment, individuals need to be educated about the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proper use of both the NII and the information it contains. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
7. As ambitious as the task is, these Principles attempt to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
address these issues. That said, one must recognize the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
limitations inherent in any such principles. First, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Principles are not intended to have the force of law. Broad 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
sweeping principles provide a framework for addressing fair 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
information practices, but any specific regulatory implementation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
must be sector by sector. This is because each information sector 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(e.g., medical, financial, law enforcement, national security, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
research and statistics) has specific and unique needs that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
cannot be addressed by general principles. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
8. Second, the Principles are only intended to apply 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
domestically; although, to the best of our knowledge, these 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Principles are in accord with current international guidelines 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
regarding personal privacy and data protection, and should not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
hinder the ongoing development of an international information 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
infrastructure. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
9. Third, the Principles only address information 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
identifiable to a living individual. It makes little sense to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
restrict the use of information that does not relate to an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
identifiable living person, and to do so would unduly hamper 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
researchers and others who use large quantities of data for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
generic statistical purposes. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
10. Finally, although the Principles are written broadly, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
there will no doubt be times when their strict application would 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
be inappropriate. For example, public safety could be undermined 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
if law enforcement had to seek a data subject's approval before 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
obtaining transactional records relevant to an ongoing criminal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
investigation on the theory that this use was incompatible with 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the purpose for which the records were originally created. To 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
account for such cases, the words ``as appropriate'' or ``to the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
extent reasonable'' appear in the Principles. This is not to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
suggest, however, that the Principles need not be rigorously 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
adhered to. To the contrary, the need to diverge from a given 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
principle should be the exception, not the rule, and should only 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
occur when there is an compelling reason. For in the end, it is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
adherence to these Principles that is critical to developing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
trust between data users and data subjects in the electronic 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
information age.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
11. We begin with the three principles that apply to all NII 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
participants: information collectors, information users, and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
individuals (``data subjects''). These three principles, relating 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to privacy and information integrity, provide the underpinnings 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for the successful implementation of the NII. They state clearly 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that individuals are entitled to a reasonable expectation of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
information privacy, and that efforts should be made to ensure 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that information is adequately protected and used appropriately. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
12. If the NII is to be trusted, participants must have a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reasonable expectation of privacy in personal information. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Although individuals harbor subjective expectations of privacy, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
these must be honored only to the extent that society is prepared 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to recognize those subjective expectations as objectively 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reasonable. For example, an individual who posts an unencrypted 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
personal message in an area of a bulletin board service that is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
provided for open, public messages cannot reasonably expect that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
his/her message will only be read by the individual listed in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
salutation. Where a subjective expectation of privacy is made 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
clear and is objectively reasonable, however, individuals should 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
have their privacy respected. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
13. NII participants must also be able to rely upon the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
integrity of the information contained in and transmitted through 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the NII. This will be the case only if the information is secure 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
from improper disclosure and alteration, and if the information 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
is accurate, timely, complete, and relevant for the purpose for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
which it is used. The responsibility of providing adequate 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
security and reliable information falls properly on all 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
participants in the NII. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
14. We recognize, of course, that individuals and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
organizations do not always provide accurate and complete data 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
when requested. Large data brokers, as well as privacy advocates, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
may intentionally provide false data as a method of monitoring 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
data flow. For example, an individual who misspells his name 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
slightly when dealing with one company and then receives mail, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
with the name similarly misspelled, from a second company, may 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
now be aware that the first company has disseminated his name to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
others. We do not intend to suggest that any falsehood violates 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
this principle. It would violate this principle, however, to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
provide false information to create some improper result (such as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
receiving illegitimate benefits or injuring another).

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
15. One of the most alluring features of the NII_easy access 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to and dissemination of information_also provides one of its most 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
vexing problems: it is impossible for an individual to identify 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
all the other individuals and organizations that may possess some 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
personal information about himself or herself. At the risk of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
over-simplification, there are essentially two types of data 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
users: those who collect information directly from the data 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
subject, and those who do not. By necessity, the rules for these 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
two groups must differ. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
16. Those who collect information directly from the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
individual should inform the data subject 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) how the information collected will be used, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) whether the information will remain confidential and be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
protected against improper access or alteration, and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) the consequences of providing or withholding the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requested information. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The fulfilling of these obligations will ensure that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
individuals have a meaningful opportunity to exercise sound 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
judgment in accordance with the Principles for Individuals Who 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Provide Personal Information. Juxtaposed, the Principles for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Information Collectors and Principles for Individuals Who Provide 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Personal Information highlight the true interactive nature of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
NII and the ideal symbiotic relationship between data collectors 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and data subjects. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
17. It is simply impossible, of course, to impose these 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Information Collector obligations on entities that have no direct 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
relationship with the individual. If every recipient of data were 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
required to contact every individual on whom they receive data to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
provide some form of notice, the exchange of information would 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
become unduly burdensome, and the benefits of the NII would be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
lost. On the other hand, information dispersion will be common on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the NII and the following principles, designed to promote fair 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
information use, should apply to all data users (including data 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
collectors).

18. In an environment where individuals cannot realistically 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
know where all personal information about them resides, and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
cannot account for each use of that information, it is simply 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
impossible for individuals to ensure that personal information is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
used fairly. In some cases, even arguably adverse actions may go 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
unnoticed, and therefore redress will not be available. For 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
example, a company may decide not to include an individual in a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
mass mailing offer regarding a financial opportunity because an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
analysis of that individual's credit history suggests the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
individual is a bad credit risk. In such an environment, it is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
particularly important to ensure that data users use personal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
information in acceptable ways. The following principles, which 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
apply to all users (including Collectors), fall into four 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
categories: Acquisition and Use, Protection, Education, and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Fairness.

may also have a negative effect on personal privacy. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Additionally, that privacy, once lost, cannot always be entirely 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
restored (consider, for example, the extent to which the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
inappropriate release of extremely embarrassing personal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
information is rectified by a public apology). To protect the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
information privacy of individuals adequately requires that the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
effect of data use be considered before personal information is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
obtained or used. In assessing this effect, data users will need 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to consider not just the effect of their action on the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
individual, but other factors (such as public opinion and market 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
forces) which may be relevant in determining whether a particular 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
data use is appropriate. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
20. It may well be that the effect on personal privacy has 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
been considered and it has been decided, appropriately, to obtain 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and use personal information for some purpose. In such cases, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
data user should obtain only that information which could 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reasonably be expected to support current or planned activities. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Although the cost of storing information continues to decrease, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
it is simply inappropriate to collect volumes of personal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
information because it may, in the future, prove to be of some 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
unanticipated value. Moreover, once collected, personal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
information should only be used for those current or planned 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
activities, or other compatible purposes. Incompatible uses not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
authorized by law should not be undertaken without consultation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
with the data subject. See, Fairness Principles, below. Finally, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
information should only be kept as long as necessary. It should 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
be destroyed when appropriate. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
21. Reasonable efforts should be made to ensure that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
information that will be relied upon is accurate, timely, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
complete, and relevant. It must be recognized that information 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
which is accurate when collected may not be used for years, and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the use of stale information may have unfair or inaccurate 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
results.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
22. In a networked environment, the risk of unauthorized 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
access (i.e., loss of confidentiality) and unauthorized 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
alteration (i.e., loss of data integrity) increases 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
exponentially. Both insiders and outsiders may browse through 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
information they have no right to see, or make hard-to-detect 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
changes in data which will then be relied upon in making 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
decisions that affect the individual. For example, our national 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
health system expects to become an intentive user of the NII. A 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
hospital in remote part of the country may pass x-rays through 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the NII for review by a renowned radiologist at a teaching 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
hospital in another part of the country. For improving the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
quality of patient care, the benefits of such transfers are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
enormous. Yet, it is unlikely that such sensitive data will be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
passed through a system where it could be subject to unauthorized 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
alteration and potential misuse? It is therefore incumbent on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
data users to protect the data commensurate with the harm that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
might occur if the data were improperly disclosed or altered. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Additionally, the level of protection should be consistent with 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
whatever the data subject was told if the data was collected 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
directly from the individual. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
23. It is not enough, however, to rely upon technical 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
controls. Although technological safeguards can serve to protect 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
data confidentiality and integrity, there is a human component 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that defies a solely technical solution. For example, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
insiders_those who are authorized to access and alter data_may 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
not violate access controls when they improperly alter or delete 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
data they are authorized to change. Therefore, the protections 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
employed must be multi-faceted and include technical solutions, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
management solutions (e.g., creating an environment where fair 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
information practices are the accepted norm), and educational 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
solutions (e.g., providing data handlers with proper training). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=3 -->
C. Education Principle 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
24. The Education Principle represents a significant addition 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to the traditional Fair Information Principles. The effect of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
NII on both data use and personal privacy is by no means readily 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
apparent. Most individuals are ignorant as to the amount of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
personal information already networked, and may not recognize how 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
their lives can be affected by networked information. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
25. It is important that information users appreciate how the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
NII affects information privacy, and that individuals understand 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the ways in which personal information can be used in this new 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
environment. Thus, data users need to educate themselves, their 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
own employees, and the public in general about how personal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
information is obtained, transmitted, used and stored, including 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
what types of security measures are being used to protect data 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
confidentiality and data integrity.

D. Fairness Principles 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
26. If information can be used to adversely affect an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
individual, it is only fair that individual have a reasonable 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
means to obtain, review, and correct personal information about 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
himself or herself. Moreover, to the extent adverse actions are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
taken against the individual, the individual should be notified 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and have a means of redress. Equally important, the data 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
collector should explain to the individual exactly what that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
means of redress is. Redress may take many forms (mediation, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
arbitration, civil suit, criminal prosecution) and be offered in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
different forums (federal, state, local) but cannot be imposed by 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
these principles. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
27. One of the most difficult issues is dealing with 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
incompatible uses of previously collected information. An 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
incompatible use is not necessarily a bad use; in fact, it may be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of considerable benefit to either a data subject or society as a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
whole. A data subject may benefit, for example, when a customer 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
mailing list is used to warn those customers that a product that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
they purchased is defective and may cause serious physical 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
injury. Society as a whole may benefit when criminal conviction 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
information is used for some purpose not originally contemplated 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
such as screening candidates for child care positions or weapons 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
purchases. Similarly, researchers and statisticians using 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
previously collected information may determine the cause of a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
potentially fatal disease such as cancer. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
28. On the other hand, without some limitation, information 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
use may know no boundaries. Individuals who disclose information 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for one purpose may then be subjected to unintended and undesired 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
consequences, and this will discourage them from disclosing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
personal information in the future. To ensure that this does not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
occur, information should only be used in ways compatible with 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the purposes for which it was collected and, before incompatible 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
uses occur, they must either be authorized by law or the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
individual data subject should be notified so that he or she can 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
opt out of such use. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

Personal Information

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
29. As noted, the NII has significant implications for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
information use and personal privacy. In such an interactive 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
environment, it is not sufficient for individuals to disclose 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
personal information and then abdicate responsibility for the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
consequences; rather, individuals must take an active role in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
deciding whether to disclose personal information in the first 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
instance. But if individuals are to be held responsible for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
making these choices, they must be empowered to make intelligent 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
choices. This requires that they receive meaningful information 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
on the intended uses of the information they provide, and the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
consequences for providing or withholding personal information. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For these purposes, the ``Principles for Individuals who Provide 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Personal Information'' create two discrete categories that apply 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to individuals: Awareness and Redress. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=3 -->
A. Awareness Principles 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
30. Awareness encompasses the notion that individuals should 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
understand the ways in which personal information may be used, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and the results that flow from such use. This will allow them to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
make intelligent choices regarding the disclosure of personal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
information. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
31. Increasingly, individuals are being asked to surrender 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
personal information about themselves. Sometimes the inquiry is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
straight-forward; for example, a bank may ask for personal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
information prior to processing a loan request. In this type of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
situation, it may be clear to the individual the purpose, or at 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
least the primary purpose, for which the information is sought 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(e.g., processing the loan application). There may, however, be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
secondary uses which are not so immediately obvious, such as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
being put on a mailing list for a credit card solicitation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Indeed, there are no doubt many times when individuals decide to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
disclose information without being fully cognizant of the many 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ways in which that information may ultimately be used. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
32. It is difficult, if not impossible, to anticipate all 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
such uses. Individuals who pay for medical services with a charge 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
card may not recognize that they are creating transactional 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
records from which others may attempt to ascertain the current 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
state of the individual's health. Equally problematic is that the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
assumptions drawn from such data may be false, and the individual 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
may never know that the data has been used to reach some 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
conclusion, or take some action, regarding his or her future. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
33. It is impossible to formulate any set of principles that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
can cover comprehensively all possible uses of information. Nor 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
would such an attempt be wise for, in fact, different people 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
desire and expect different levels of privacy, and hold different 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
concerns regarding the ultimate use of personal data. Ultimately, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
whether an individual chooses to disclose personal information, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
or create a transactional record, should depend upon the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
individual's own wishes unless, of course, the information is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
required by law. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
34. The Awareness Principles recognize the importance of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
personal choice and cultivate an environment where these critical 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
personal decisions can be made intelligently. For whatever the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
degree of personal interest in information privacy, it is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
critical that individuals receive enough facts to make rational 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
choices regarding the disclosure of personal information. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
35. First and foremost, an individual should know the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
intended primary and secondary uses of the information. Second, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
individuals should determine whether efforts will be made to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
assure data confidentiality and data integrity. In some cases, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
confidentiality may be required by law (e.g., tax records), but 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of equal concern may be the technical and managerial controls in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
place to protect the data. This principle does not mean that the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
individual should obtain a technical explanation regarding the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
security measures used to protect such data. Indeed, such 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
technical explanations might be unwelcome, unwarranted and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
counterproductive (widespread disclosure of the technical 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
measures used might actually expose vulnerabilities in a given 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
system). But individuals should be told whether the information 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
is intended to remain confidential and whether efforts will be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
made to preserve data integrity. Some individuals might choose 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
not to disclose personal data if they knew that the data provided 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
was freely obtainable by others, or might easily be altered. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
36. Individuals should also be informed of the consequences 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of providing or withholding information. Data subjects should be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
told whether disclosing the requested information is mandatory 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i.e., required by law) or voluntary, and the consequences that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
can flow from their decision. We recognize fully that even when 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
disclosure is legally ``voluntary,'' it may in fact be coerced 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(e.g., the refusal to ``voluntarily'' provide information may 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
result in the denial of critical life-sustaining benefits). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
General principles cannot resolve such difficult issues but 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
clearly, whatever the consequences, they should be clearly 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
articulated. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
37. Lastly, there will be times when individuals feel 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
aggrieved by the improper use of personal information. If redress 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
is available, individuals should be aware of that fact, and be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
informed as to how such redress can be obtained. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=3 -->
B. Principle of Redress 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
38. Invariably, people will be harmed by the improper 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
disclosure or improper use of personal information. It is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
therefore important to implement proactive measures to limit that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
harm, and reactive measures to provide relief when harm occurs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
39. To the extent inaccurate information can be used to harm 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
individuals, it follows that individuals may wish to ensure that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
collected and stored personal information is in fact accurate and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
complete. For this reason, individuals should be able to obtain 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
from data users, as appropriate, a copy of this personal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
information and have the opportunity to correct inaccurate 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
information. This may allow them, proactively, to prevent 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
anticipated harms. This principle is, however, limited in scope. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Although, idealistically, all stored personal information should 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
be accurate, the fact remains that inaccurate personal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
information does and will exist, and correcting inaccurate data 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
cannot be done without cost. Pragmatically, it makes little or no 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
sense to devote resources to correcting data that cannot be used 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to harm the individual, and therefore the opportunity to review 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
personal information in order to correct data inaccuracies is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
limited to those cases where harm may occur. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
40. When final actions are taken against individuals, they 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
are entitled to notice. Absent notice, it may be impossible to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
seek available redress. Moreover, redress should be available for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
individuals who have been harmed by the improper use of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
information (including the use of inaccurate information). To 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ensure that individuals can take advantage of these redress 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
mechanisms, the awareness principle, as noted above, requires 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that individuals be informed of the remedies available.
